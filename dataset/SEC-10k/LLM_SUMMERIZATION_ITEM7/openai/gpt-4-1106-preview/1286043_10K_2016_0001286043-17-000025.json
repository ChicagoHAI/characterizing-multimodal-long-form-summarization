MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and Item 1A, Risk Factors,\u201d appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In this discussion, unless the context suggests otherwise, references to our Company,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d and our\u201d mean Kite Realty Group Trust and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including Kite Realty Group, L.P.\nOverview\nIn the following overview, we discuss, among other things, the status of our business and properties, the effect that current United States economic conditions is having on our retail tenants and us, and the current state of the financial markets and how it impacts our financing strategy.\nOur Business and Properties\nKite Realty Group Trust is a publicly-held real estate investment trust which, through its majority-owned subsidiary, Kite Realty Group, L.P., owns interests in various operating subsidiaries and joint ventures engaged in the ownership, operation,\nacquisition, development, and redevelopment of high-quality neighborhood and community shopping centers in selected markets in the United States. We derive revenues primarily from activities associated with the collection of contractual rents and reimbursement payments from tenants at our properties. Our operating results therefore depend materially on, among other things, the ability of our tenants to make required lease payments, the health and resilience of the United States retail sector, interest rate volatility, job growth and overall economic and real estate market conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we owned interests in 119 operating and redevelopment properties consisting of 108 retail properties, nine retail redevelopment properties, one office operating property and an associated parking garage. We also owned two development projects under construction as of this date.\nPortfolio Update\nIn evaluating acquisition, development, and redevelopment opportunities, we look for strong sub-markets where average household income is above the broader market average. We also focus on locations with population density, high traffic counts, and strong daytime workforce populations. Household incomes in our largest sub-markets are significantly higher than the medians for those broader markets.\nIn 2016, we transitioned the Holly Springs Towne Center - Phase II and Tamiami Crossing development projects to the operating portfolio. We also began construction on our expansion of Holly Springs - Phase II in the fourth quarter. Our 3-R initiative, which includes a total of 20 existing and potential projects, continued to progress in 2016. Ten of these projects are under construction with total estimated costs of $58.0 million to $66.5 million and estimated combined returns of 9.0% to 10.0%. There are 10 additional projects under active evaluation with potential estimated costs of $80 to $100 million and potential returns of 9.0% to 11.0%. We completed construction on four 3-R projects during the fourth quarter: Hitchcock Plaza, Shops at Moore, Tarpon Bay Plaza, and Traders Point.\nIn addition to targeting sub-markets with strong consumer demographics, we focus on having the appropriate tenant mix at each center. Many of our tenants are service-oriented or have a prominent online platform that has reduced the impact of the expansion of e-commerce on their operations. We have aggressively targeted and executed leases with notable grocers including Publix, Trader Joes, and Aldi along with soft goods retailers such as Ross Dress for Less, Ulta and Nordstrom Rack. Additionally, we have identified cost-efficient ways to optimize space for junior anchors such as right-sizing office supply stores and backfilling the existing space with a tenant more suitable to the larger space. In addition, many of our redevelopment projects include consolidating small shop space to accommodate construction of new junior anchor space.\nCapital and Financing Activities\nOur ability to obtain capital on satisfactory terms and to refinance borrowings as they mature is affected by the condition of the economy in general and by the financial strength of properties securing borrowings.\nThroughout 2016, we strengthened our balance sheet by retiring multiple property-level secured loans and unencumbering the related assets securing the loans. We increased our liquidity through amending our existing unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured term loan, which allows us the option to increase the borrowing capacity of the unsecured revolving credit facility to $1 billion and the option to increase our unsecured term loan to provide for an additional $200 million. We also issued $300 million of Notes in a public offering. As of December 31, 2016, we have reduced our term maturities through 2020 to approximately $90 million and extended our weighted-average debt maturities to 6.4 years.\nThe amount that we may borrow under our unsecured revolving credit facility is limited by the value of the assets in our unencumbered asset pool. As of December 31, 2016, the value of the assets in our unencumbered asset pool was $420.4 million. Taking into account outstanding borrowings and letters of credit, we had $409.9 million available under our unsecured revolving credit facility for future borrowings as of December 31, 2016. In addition, we had $19.9 million in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2016.\nThe unencumbering of a number of properties, drawing the remaining amount on our 7-Year Term Loan, amending our existing unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured term loan and issuing the Notes provides us with more flexibility for future capital activity. In addition, the investment grade credit ratings we received in 2014 provide us with access to the unsecured public bond market, which we may continue to use in the future to finance acquisition activity, repay debt maturing in the near term and fix interest rates.\nSummary of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. As disclosed in Note 2, the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the compilation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, subjective, and complex judgments.\nValuation of Investment Properties\nManagement reviews operational and development projects, land parcels and intangible assets for impairment on at least a quarterly basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. The review for possible impairment requires management to make certain assumptions and estimates and requires significant judgment. Impairment losses for investment properties and intangible assets are measured when the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the investment properties during the expected holding period are less than the carrying amounts of those assets. Impairment losses are recorded as the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the asset. Our impairment review for land and development properties assumes we have the intent and the ability to complete the developments or projected uses for the land parcels. If we determine those plans will not be completed or our assumptions with respect to operating assets are not realized, an impairment loss may be appropriate.\nDepreciation may be accelerated for a redevelopment project, including partial demolition of existing structures after the asset is assessed for impairment.\nOperating properties will be classified as held for sale only when those properties are available for immediate sale in their present condition and for which management believes it is probable that a sale of the property will be completed within one year, among other factors. Operating properties classified as held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell. Depreciation and amortization are suspended during the held-for-sale period.\nOur operating properties have operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished from the rest of our activities. Historically, the operations reported in discontinued operations include those operating properties that were sold or were considered held for sale and for which operations and cash flows can be clearly distinguished. The operations from these properties are eliminated from ongoing operations, and we will not have a continuing involvement after disposition. In the first quarter of 2014, we adopted the provisions of ASU 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity, which will result in fewer real estate sales being classified within discontinued operations, as only disposals representing a strategic shift in operations will be presented as discontinued operations. All operating properties included in discontinued operations in 2014 were classified as such prior to the adoption of ASU 2014-08, and no properties that have been sold, or designated as held-for-sale, since the adoption of ASU 2014-08, have met the revised criteria for classification within discontinued operations.\nAcquisition of Real Estate Investments\nUpon acquisition of real estate operating properties, we estimate the fair value of acquired identifiable tangible assets and identified intangible assets and liabilities, assumed debt, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the date of acquisition, based on evaluation of information and estimates available at that date. Based on these estimates, we record the estimated fair value to the applicable assets and liabilities. In making estimates of fair values, a number of sources are utilized, including information obtained as a result of pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing and leasing activities. The estimates of fair value were determined to have primarily relied upon Level 2 and Level 3 inputs, as defined below.\nFair value is determined for tangible assets and intangibles, including:\nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the fair value of the building on an as-if-vacant basis and the fair value of land determined either by comparable market data, real estate tax assessments, independent appraisals or other relevant data;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 190: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>above-market and below-market in-place lease values for acquired properties, which are based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) management's estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over the remaining non-cancelable term of the leases. Any below-market renewal options are also considered in the in-place lease values. The capitalized above-market and below-market lease values are amortized as a reduction of or addition to rental income over the term of the lease. Should a tenant vacate, terminate its lease, or otherwise notify us of its intent to do so, the unamortized portion of the lease intangibles would be charged or credited to income;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 191: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the value of having a lease in place at the acquisition date. We utilize independent and internal sources for our estimates to determine the respective in-place lease values. Our estimates of value are made using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers. Factors we consider in our analysis include an estimate of costs to execute similar leases including tenant improvements, leasing commissions and foregone costs and rent received during the estimated lease-up period as if the space was vacant. The value of in-place leases is amortized to expense over the remaining initial terms of the respective leases; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 192: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the fair value of any assumed financing that is determined to be above or below market terms. We utilize third party and independent sources for our estimates to determine the respective fair value of each mortgage payable. The fair market value of each mortgage payable is amortized to interest expense over the remaining initial terms of the respective loan.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe also consider whether there is any value to in-place leases that have a related customer relationship intangible value. Characteristics we consider in determining these values include the nature and extent of existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant's credit quality, and expectations of lease renewals, among other factors. To date, a tenant relationship has not been developed that is considered to have a current intangible value.\nWe finalize the measurement period of our business combinations when all facts and circumstances are understood, but in no circumstances will the measurement period exceed one year.\nRevenue Recognition\nAs a lessor of real estate assets, the Company retains substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership and account for its leases as operating leases.\nContractual rent, percentage rent, and expense reimbursements from tenants for common area maintenance costs, insurance and real estate taxes are our principal sources of revenue. Base minimum rents are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective leases. Certain lease agreements contain provisions that grant additional rents based on a tenant's sales volume (contingent overage rent). Overage rent is recognized when tenants achieve the specified sales targets as defined in their lease agreements. Overage rent is included in other property related revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. As a result of generating this revenue, we will routinely have accounts receivable due from tenants. We are subject to\ntenant defaults and bankruptcies that may affect the collection of outstanding receivables. To address the collectability of these receivables, we analyze historical write-off experience, tenant credit-worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts and straight line rent reserve. Although we estimate uncollectible receivables and provide for them through charges against income, actual experience may differ from those estimates.\nGains or losses from sales of real estate are recognized when a sale has been consummated, the buyer's initial and continuing investment is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the asset, we have transferred to the buyer the usual risks and rewards of ownership, and we do not have a substantial continuing financial involvement in the property. As part of our ongoing business strategy, we will, from time to time, sell land parcels and outlots, some of which are ground leased to tenants.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe follow the framework established under accounting standard FASB ASC 820 for measuring fair value of non-financial assets and liabilities that are not required or permitted to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis but only in certain circumstances, such as a business combination or upon determination of impairment.\nAssets and liabilities recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets are categorized based on the inputs to the valuation techniques as follows:\nTable 193: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Level 1 fair value inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments to which we have access.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Level 2 fair value inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for similar instruments, either directly or indirectly, and appropriately consider counterparty creditworthiness in the valuations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 195: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Level 3 fair value inputs reflect our best estimate of inputs and assumptions market participants would use in pricing an instrument at the measurement date. The inputs are unobservable in the market and significant to the valuation estimate.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. As discussed in Note 10 to the Financial Statements, we have determined that its derivative valuations are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nCash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, escrows and deposits, and other working capital balances approximate fair value.\nNote 7 to the Financial Statements includes a discussion of the fair values recorded for assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Note 8 to the Financial Statements includes a discussion of the fair values recorded when we recognized an impairment charge on our Shops at Otty operating property. Level 3 inputs to these transactions include our estimations of market leasing rates, tenant-related costs, discount rates, and disposal values.\nIncome Taxes and REIT Compliance\nParent Company\nThe Parent Company, which is considered a corporation for federal income tax purposes, has been organized and intends to continue to operate in a manner that will enable it to maintain its qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. As a result, it generally will not be subject to federal income tax on the earnings that it distributes to the extent it distributes its REIT taxable income\u201d (determined before the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains) to shareholders of the Parent Company and meets certain other requirements on a recurring basis. To the extent that it satisfies this distribution requirement, but distributes less than 100% of its taxable income, it will be subject to federal corporate income tax on its undistributed REIT taxable income. REITs are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements. If the Parent Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it will be subject to federal income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates for a period of four years following the year in which qualification is lost. We may also be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income even if the Parent Company does qualify as a REIT. The Operating Partnership intends to continue to make distributions to the Parent Company in amounts sufficient to assist the Parent Company in adhering to REIT requirements and maintaining its REIT status.\nWe have elected to treat Kite Realty Holdings, LLC as a taxable REIT subsidiary of the Operating Partnership, and we may elect to treat other subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries in the future. This election enables us to receive income and provide services that would otherwise be impermissible for a REIT. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of assets and liabilities at the tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nOperating Partnership\nThe allocated share of income and loss, other than the operations of our taxable REIT subsidiary, is included in the income tax returns of the Operating Partnership's partners. Accordingly, the only federal income taxes included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements are in connection with its taxable REIT subsidiary.\nInflation\nInflation rates have been near historical lows in recent years and, therefore, have not had a significant impact on our results of operations. Most of our leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation by requiring the tenant to pay its share of operating expenses, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, or include a fixed amount for these costs that escalates over time, thereby reducing our exposure to increases in operating expenses resulting from inflation. Also, most of our leases have original terms of fewer than ten years, which enables us to adjust rental rates to market upon lease renewal.\nResults of Operations\nAs of December 31, 2016, we owned interests in 119 properties and two development projects currently under construction. The following table sets forth the total operating and redevelopment properties and development projects that we owned as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td># of Properties\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail Operating Properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>108\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>118\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Office Operating Properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Redevelopment Properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Operating and Redevelopment Properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>123\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Development Projects\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total All Properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>127\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe comparability of results of operations is affected by our Merger with Inland Diversified on July 1, 2014 and by our development, redevelopment, and operating property acquisition and disposition activities in 2014 through 2016. Therefore, we believe it is most useful to review the comparisons of our results of operations for these years (as set forth below under Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\u201d and Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\u201d) in conjunction with the discussion of these activities during those periods, which is set forth below.\nProperty Acquisition Activities\nDuring the three years ended December 31, 2016, we acquired the properties listed in the table below.\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property Name\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>MSA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Acquisition Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Owned GLA\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Merger with Inland Diversified (60 operating properties)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Various\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>July 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,719,471\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rampart Commons\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Las Vegas, NV\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Colleyville Downs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dallas, TX\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>April 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>190,940\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Belle Isle Station\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Oklahoma City, OK\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>164,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Livingston Shopping Center\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>New York -

We define NOI as income from our real estate including lease termination fees received from tenants less our property operating expenses. NOI excludes amortization of capitalized tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions and corporate level expenses.\nWe believe that NOI, is helpful to investors as a measure of our operating performance because it excludes various items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of our operating performance, such as depreciation and amortization, interest expense, and impairment, if any. We believe that Same Property NOI is helpful to investors as a measure of our operating performance because it includes only the NOI of properties that have been owned for the full period presented, which eliminates disparities in net income due to the redevelopment, acquisition or disposition of properties during the particular period presented and thus provides a more consistent metric for the comparison of our properties. NOI and Same Property NOI should not, however, be considered as alternatives to net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) as indicators of our financial performance. Our computation of Same Property NOI may differ from the methodology used by other REITs, and therefore, may not be comparable to such other REITs.\nWhen evaluating the properties that are included in the same property pool, we have established specific criteria for determining the inclusion of properties acquired or those recently under development. An acquired property is included in the same property pool when there is a full quarter of operations in both years subsequent to the acquisition date. Development and redevelopment properties are included in the same property pool 12 months after construction is substantially complete and the properties have been transferred to the operating portfolio. A redevelopment property is first excluded from the same property pool when the execution of a redevelopment plan is likely and we begin recapturing space from tenants. During various periods in 2016, between nine and 13 properties were excluded from the same property pool that were owned in both comparable periods but did not meet the criteria for inclusion in the same property pool.\nThe following table reflects Same Property NOI1 and a reconciliation to net income attributable to common shareholders for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (unaudited):\nTable 204: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leased percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Economic Occupancy percentage2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net operating income -

We calculate FFO, a non-GAAP financial measure, in accordance with the best practices described in the April 2002 National Policy Bulletin of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\"). The NAREIT white paper defines FFO as net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales and impairments of depreciated property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.\nConsidering the nature of our business as a real estate owner and operator, we believe that FFO is helpful to investors in measuring our operational performance because it excludes various items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of our operating performance, such as gains or losses from sales of depreciated property and depreciation and amortization, which can make periodic and peer analyses of operating performance more difficult. For informational purposes, we have also provided FFO adjusted for a severance charge, accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs, a debt extinguishment loss and transaction costs in 2016, a non-cash adjustment for redemption of preferred shares in 2015, a gain on the resolution of an assumed contingency in 2015, and a gain on settlement and transaction costs in 2015. We believe this supplemental information provides a meaningful measure of our operating performance. We believe our presentation of FFO, as adjusted, provides investors with another financial measure that may facilitate comparison of operating performance between periods and among our peer companies. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of our financial performance, is not an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, and is not indicative of funds available to satisfy our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions. Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do.\nOur calculations of FFO1 and reconciliation to consolidated net income and FFO, as adjusted for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (unaudited) are as follows:\nTable 206: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated net income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,315\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4,676\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: cash dividends on preferred shares\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,877\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,456\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: non-cash adjustment for redemption of preferred shares\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,797\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,844\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,854\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,435\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: gains on sales of operating properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,253\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,066\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,776\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: impairment charge\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,592\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: depreciation and amortization of consolidated entities, net of noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>173,578\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>166,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>120,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> FFO of the Operating Partnership1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>170,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>179,822\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Limited Partners' interests in FFO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,872\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,789\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,541\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> FFO attributable to Kite Realty Group Trust common shareholders1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>166,725\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>176,033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>91,568\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO of the Operating Partnership1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>170,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>179,822\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>94,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: gain on settlement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,520\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs (non-cash)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,121\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: transaction costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: severance charge\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: adjustment for redemption of preferred shares (non-cash)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,797\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: gain from release of assumed earnout liability (non-cash)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,832\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add (less): loss (gain) on debt extinguishment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>819\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,645\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO, as adjusted, of the Operating Partnership\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>175,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>170,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>121,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 207: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>____________________\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1\n</td> <td> FFO of the Operating Partnership\" measures 100% of the operating performance of the Operating Partnership's real estate properties.

For informational purposes, we have also provided Adjusted EBITDA, which we define as EBITDA less (i) EBITDA from unconsolidated entities, (ii) gains on sales of operating properties or impairment charges, (iii) other income and expense, (iv) noncontrolling interest EBITDA and (v) other non-recurring activity or items impacting comparability from period to period. Annualized Adjusted EBITDA is Adjusted EBITDA for the most recent quarter multiplied by four. Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA is our share of net debt divided by Annualized Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Annualized Adjusted EBITDA and Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA, as calculated by us, are not comparable to EBITDA and EBITDA-related measures reported by other REITs that do not define EBITDA and EBITDA-related measures exactly as we do. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Annualized Adjusted EBITDA do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered alternatives to net income as an indicator of performance or as alternatives to cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of liquidity.\nConsidering the nature of our business as a real estate owner and operator, we believe that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and the ratio of Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA are helpful to investors in measuring our operational performance because they exclude various items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of our operating performance, such as gains or losses from sales of depreciated property and depreciation and amortization, which can make periodic and peer analyses of operating performance more difficult. For informational purposes, we have also provided Annualized Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted as described above. We believe this supplemental information provides a meaningful measure of our operating performance. We believe presenting EBITDA and the related measures in this manner allows investors and other interested parties to form a more meaningful assessment of our operating results.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of our EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Annualized Adjusted EBITDA to consolidated net income (the most directly comparable GAAP measure) and a calculation of Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA.\nTable 208: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments to net income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,613\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense of taxable REIT subsidiary\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64,503\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments to EBITDA:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unconsolidated EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sales of operating properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,059\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income and expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noncontrolling interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(461\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annualized Adjusted EBITDA1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>240,368\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Company share of net debt:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage and other indebtedness\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,731,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Partner share of consolidated joint venture debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13,737\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28,911\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Debt Premium\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(676\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Company Share of Net Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,687,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.0x\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 209: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>____________________\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1\n</td> <td>Represents Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended December 31, 2016 (as shown in the table above) multiplied by four.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nThe comparability of results of operations is affected by our acquisitions of Colleyville Downs, Belle Isle Station, Livingston Shopping Center, and Chapel Hill Shopping Center in the second and third quarters of 2015 and the sales of seven operating properties in March 2015, two operating properties in December 2015, and two operating properties in early 2016.

<td>$\n</td> <td>10,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe net increase of $3.0 million in rental income for properties fully operational during 2015 and 2016 is primarily attributable to an increase in rental rates, increase in economic occupancy percentage, and improved expense control and operating expense recovery resulting in an improvement in net recoveries of $1.9 million.\nThe average rents for new comparable leases signed in 2016 were $20.83 per square foot compared to average expiring rents of $17.57 per square foot in that period. The average rents for renewals signed in 2016 were $15.85 per square foot compared to average expiring rents of $14.79 per square foot in that period. Our same property economic occupancy improved to 93.4% as of December 31, 2016 from 92.9% as of December 31, 2015. For our retail operating portfolio, annualized base rent per square foot improved to $15.53 per square foot as of December 31, 2016, up from $15.22 per square foot as of December 31, 2015.\nOther property related revenue primarily consists of parking revenues, overage rent, lease termination income and gains on sales of undepreciated assets. This revenue decreased by $3.4 million, primarily as a result lower gains on sales of undepreciated assets of $1.7 million, decreases of $1.1 million in lease termination income, and fluctuations in other miscellaneous activities.\nProperty operating expenses decreased $2.1 million, or 4.1%, due to the following:\nTable 212: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>Net change 2015 to 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties acquired during 2015\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Development properties that became operational or were partially operational in 2015 and/or 2016\n</td> <td>683\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties sold during 2015 and 2016\n</td> <td>(1,288\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties under redevelopment during 2015 and/or 2016\n</td> <td>(444\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties fully operational during 2015 and 2016 and other\n</td> <td>(2,578\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,050\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe net $2.6 million decrease for properties fully operational during 2015 and 2016 is primarily due to a combination of decreases of $1.2 million in bad debt expense, $0.8 million in trash removal expense as tenants began contracting for this item directly with outside vendors, $0.5 million in insurance costs as we generated efficiencies with our larger operating platform, $0.3 million in utility expense, and $0.2 million in snow removal expense. The decreases were offset by an increase of $0.5 million in landscaping expense.\nAs a percentage of revenue, property operating expenses decreased between years from 14.4% to 13.5%. The decrease was mostly due to an improvement in expense control and an improvement in operating expense recoveries from tenants as a result of higher occupancy rates.\nReal estate taxes increased $1.9 million, or 4.7%, due to the following:\nTable 213: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>Net change 2015 to 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties acquired during 2015\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Development properties that became operational or were partially operational in 2015 and/or 2016\n</td> <td>372\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties sold during 2015 and 2016\n</td> <td>(636\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties under redevelopment during 2015 and/or 2016\n</td> <td>(127\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties fully operational during 2015 and 2016 and other\n</td> <td>908\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,934\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe net $0.9 million increase in real estate taxes for properties fully operational during 2015 and 2016 is due to higher tax assessments at certain operating properties. The majority of our real estate tax expense is recoverable from tenants and reflected in tenant reimbursement revenue.\nGeneral, administrative and other expenses increased $1.9 million, or 10.1%. The increase is due primarily to higher payroll costs and company overhead expenses of $1.4 million and a severance charge of $0.5 million in the first quarter of 2016.\nTransaction costs generally consist of legal, lender, due diligence, and other expenses for professional services. Such costs increased $1.2 million as we had terminated transaction costs of $2.8 million in 2016, compared to property acquisition costs of $1.6 million over the same period in 2015.\nWe recorded a non-cash gain from the release of an assumed earnout liability of $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The expiration date of the underlying third party earnout agreement was December 28, 2015, and the original sellers were unable to perform the necessary leasing activity by this date that would have resulted in payment by us of the previously recorded obligation.\nWe recorded an impairment charge of $1.6 million related to our Shops at Otty operating property for the year ended December 31, 2015. This charge was recorded due to our intent to sell the property in the near term, which shortened the intended holding period. This property was sold in the second quarter of 2016. See additional discussion in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $7.3 million, or 4.3%, due to the following:\nTable 214: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>Net change 2015 to 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties acquired during 2015\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Development properties that became operational or were partially operational in 2015 and/or 2016\n</td> <td>4,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties sold during 2015 and 2016\n</td> <td>(1,603\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties under redevelopment during 2015 and/or 2016\n</td> <td>2,434\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties fully operational during 2015 and 2016 and other\n</td> <td>(1,914\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe net increase of $2.4 million in properties under redevelopment during 2015 and 2016 is primarily due to an increase of $1.9 million in accelerated depreciation and amortization from the demolition of a portion of a building at one of our redevelopment properties. The net decrease of $1.9 million in depreciation at properties fully operational during 2015 and 2016 is due to a decrease in accelerated depreciation and amortization on tenant-specific assets from multiple tenants vacating at several operating properties in 2016, compared to the same period in 2015.\nInterest expense increased $9.1 million or 16.2%. The increase is due to recording $1.0 million in accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs from amending the unsecured term loans, retiring Term Loan A and securing longer-term fixed rate debt through the issuance of senior unsecured notes in the second half of 2015 and in the third quarter of 2016 that carried higher interest rates than the variable rate on our unsecured revolving credit facility, which was paid down with the proceeds. We also redeemed all of our outstanding preferred shares in the fourth quarter of 2015 using the proceeds from the senior unsecured notes. The increase is also due to certain development projects, including Parkside Town Commons - Phase I and Holly Springs Towne Center - Phase II becoming operational. As a portion of the project becomes operational, we cease capitalization of the related interest expense.\nWe recorded a non-cash gain on debt extinguishment of $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, related to the retirement of the $90 million loan secured by our City Center operating property.\nWe recorded a gain on settlement of $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, related to the settlement of a dispute related to eminent domain and related damages at one of our operating properties. See additional discussion in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nThe comparability of results of operations is affected by our Merger with Inland Diversified and the acquisition of Rampart Commons in 2014, the acquisitions of Colleyville Downs, Belle Isle Station, Livingston Shopping Center, and Chapel Hill Shopping Center in 2015 and the sale of 15 properties sold in late 2014 and early 2015.

rental income for properties fully operational in both years is primarily attributable to an increase in rental rates, and an improvement in economic occupancy.\nThe average rents for new comparable leases signed in 2015 were $20.23 per square foot compared to average expiring rents of $16.59 per square foot in that period. The average rents for renewals signed in 2015 were $12.58 per square foot compared to average expiring rents of $11.53 per square foot in that period. Our same property economic occupancy improved to 93.9% as of December 31, 2015 from 93.7% as of December 31, 2014. For our retail operating portfolio, annualized base rent per square foot improved to $15.22 per square foot as of December 31, 2015, up from $15.15 per square foot as of December 31, 2014.\nOther property related revenue primarily consists of parking revenues, overage rent, specialty leasing income, lease termination income and gains related to sales of land parcels peripheral to our properties. This revenue increased by $5.7 million, primarily as a result of higher gains on land sales of $4.1 million, an increase of $0.5 million in specialty leasing income, an increase of $0.5 million in lease termination income and an increase in overage rent of $0.3 million.\nProperty operating expenses increased $11.3 million, or 29.1%, due to the following:\nTable 217: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>Net change 2014 to 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties acquired during 2014 or 2015 and retained\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Development properties that became operational or were partially operational in 2014 and/or 2015\n</td> <td>767\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties sold during 2014 or 2015 including properties acquired in the Merger\n</td> <td>(1,616\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties under redevelopment during 2014 and/or 2015 including properties acquired in the Merger\n</td> <td>1,811\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties fully operational during 2014 and 2015 and other\n</td> <td>432\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe net $0.4 million increase for properties fully operational is due to an increase of $1.5 million in on-site personnel and regional office costs, $0.7 million in bad debt expense, and $0.2 million in marketing costs, offset by a decrease of $0.5 million in insurance costs as we leveraged our larger operating platform, $1.1 million in repair and maintenance costs, and $0.4 million in snow removal costs.\nProperty operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 were 14.4% compared to 14.9% over the same period in the prior year. The decrease was mostly due to higher other property related revenue and an improvement in expense recoveries from tenants as a result of higher economic occupancy rates. The overall recovery ratio for reimbursable expenses improved to 87.1% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 85.3% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nReal estate taxes increased $11.0 million, or 36.6%, due to the following:\nTable 218: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>Net change 2014 to 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties acquired during 2014 or 2015 and retained\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Development properties that became operational or were partially operational in 2014 and/or 2015\n</td> <td>215\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties sold during 2014 or 2015 including properties acquired in the Merger\n</td> <td>(1,213\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties under redevelopment during 2014 and/or 2015 including properties acquired in the Merger\n</td> <td>1,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties fully operational during 2014 and 2015 and other\n</td> <td>646\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,957\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe net $0.6 million increase in real estate taxes for properties fully operational during 2014 and 2015 is due to higher tax assessments at certain operating properties. The majority of changes in our real estate tax expense is recoverable from tenants and, therefore, reflected in tenant reimbursement revenue.\nGeneral, administrative and other expenses increased $5.7 million, or 43.4%. The increase is due primarily to higher public company costs and personnel costs associated with the Merger. Our employee base increased from 95 full-time employees as of December 31, 2013 to 145 full-time employees as of December 31, 2015.\nTransaction costs in 2014 related almost entirely to our Merger with Inland Diversified and totaled $27.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $1.6 million of costs for various property acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nWe recorded a non-cash gain from the release of an assumed earnout liability of $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The expiration date of the associated earnout liability was December 28, 2015, and the original sellers were unable to perform the necessary leasing activity that would have resulted in payment of the previously estimated obligation.\nWe recorded an impairment charge of $1.6 million related to our Shops at Otty operating property for the year ended December 31, 2015. See additional discussion in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $46.3 million, or 38.3%, due to the following:\nTable 219: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>Net change 2014 to 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties acquired during 2014 or 2015 and retained\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,414\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Development properties that became operational or were partially operational in 2014 and/or 2015\n</td> <td>2,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties sold during 2014 or 2015 including properties acquired in the Merger\n</td> <td>(3,456\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties under redevelopment during 2014 and/or 2015 including properties acquired in the Merger\n</td> <td>3,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties fully operational during 2014 and 2015 and other\n</td> <td>(2,028\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe net $2.0 million decrease in depreciation at properties fully operational during 2014 and 2015 is mainly due to a tenant vacating at an operating property in 2014, which resulted in the acceleration of depreciation and amortization on certain assets.\nInterest expense increased $10.9 million or 24.0%. The increase mainly resulted from our assumption of $859.6 million of debt as part of the Merger with Inland Diversified, in addition to draws on the unsecured revolving credit facility to fund a portion of our 2015 acquisitions. In addition, we secured longer-term fixed rate debt through the issuance of senior unsecured notes that carried higher interest rates than the variable rate on our unsecured revolving credit facility. The increase was also due to certain development projects, including Delray Marketplace and Parkside Town Commons - Phase I becoming operational. As a portion of the project becomes operational, we expense a pro-rata amount of related interest expense.\nWe recorded a non-cash gain on debt extinguishment of $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, related to the retirement of the $90 million loan secured by our City Center operating property.\nWe recorded a gain on settlement of $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, related to the settlement of a dispute related to eminent domain and related damages at one of our operating properties. See additional discussion in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe allocation of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased due to allocations to joint venture partners in certain consolidated properties acquired as part of the Merger with Inland Diversified. These partners are allocated income generally equal to the distribution received from the operations of the properties in which they hold an interest.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur primary finance and capital strategy is to maintain a strong balance sheet with sufficient flexibility to fund our operating and investment activities in a cost-effective manner. We consider a number of factors when evaluating our level of indebtedness and when making decisions regarding additional borrowings or equity offerings, including the estimated value of properties to be developed or acquired, the estimated market value of our properties and the Company as a whole upon placement of the borrowing or offering, and the ability of particular properties to generate cash flow to cover debt service. We will continue to monitor the capital markets and may consider raising additional capital through the issuance of our common or preferred shares, unsecured debt securities, or other securities.\nOur Principal Capital Resources\nFor a discussion of cash generated from operations, see Cash Flows,\u201d beginning on page 74. In addition to cash generated from operations, we discuss below our other principal capital resources.\nThe increased operating cash flows of the Company have substantially enhanced our liquidity position and reduced our borrowing costs. We continue to focus on a balanced approach to growth and staggering debt maturities in order to retain our financial flexibility.\nIn 2016, we drew the remaining $100 million on our $200 million 7-Year Term Loan and used the proceeds to pay down the unsecured revolving credit facility. In addition, we completed a $300 million public offering of 4.00% Senior Notes due October 1, 2026. The net proceeds were utilized to retire both the $200 million Term Loan A and the $75.9 million construction loan secured by our Parkside Town Commons operating property and to fund portions of the retirement of the $25 million loan secured by our Colonial Square and Village Walk operating properties and the $10.4 million loan secured by our Geist Pavilion operating property. We also drew on our unsecured revolving credit facility to fund the retirement of an additional $128.8 million of property level secured debt in 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $409.9 million available under our unsecured revolving credit facility for future borrowings based on the unencumbered asset pool allocated to the unsecured revolving credit facility. We also had $19.9 million in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2016.\nWe were in compliance with all applicable financial covenants under our unsecured revolving credit facility, our unsecured term loans, and our Notes as of December 31, 2016.\nWe have on file with the SEC a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 relating to the offer and sale, from time to time, of an indeterminate amount of equity and debt securities. Equity securities may be offered and sold by the Parent Company, and the net proceeds of any such offerings would be contributed to the Operating Partnership in exchange for additional General Partner Units. Debt securities may be offered and sold by the Operating Partnership with the Operating Partnership receiving the proceeds. From time to time, we may issue securities under this shelf registration statement to fund the repayment of long-term debt upon maturity and for other general corporate purposes.\nWe currently have an at-the-market equity program that allows us to issue new common shares from time to time, with an aggregate offering price of up to $250.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we issued 137,229 common shares at an average price per share of $29.52 pursuant to our at-the-market offering program, generating gross proceeds of approximately $4.1 million and, after deducting commissions and other costs, net proceeds of approximately $3.8 million. We have $245.9 million remaining available for future common share issuances under our current at-the-market equity program.\nIn the future, we will continue to monitor the capital markets and may consider raising additional capital through the issuance of our common shares, preferred shares or other securities. We may also raise capital by disposing of properties, land parcels or other assets that are no longer core components of our growth strategy. The sale price may differ from our carrying value at the time of sale.\nOur Principal Liquidity Needs\nShort-Term Liquidity Needs\nNear-Term Debt Maturities. As of December 31, 2016, we have $6.7 million of debt scheduled to mature in 2017, excluding scheduled monthly principal payments. We have sufficient liquidity to repay this obligation from current resources and our capacity on the unsecured revolving credit facility.\nOther Short-Term Liquidity Needs. The requirements for qualifying as a REIT and for a tax deduction for some or all of the dividends paid to shareholders, necessitate that we distribute at least 90% of our taxable income on an annual basis. Such requirements cause us to have substantial liquidity needs over both the short term and the long term. Our short-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay operating expenses associated with our operating properties, interest expense and scheduled principal payments on our debt, expected dividend payments to our common shareholders and to Common Unit holders, and recurring capital expenditures.\nIn November 2016, our Board of Trustees declared a cash distribution of $0.3025 per common share and Common Unit for the fourth quarter of 2016, which represented a 5.2% increase over our previous quarterly distribution. This distribution was paid on January 13, 2017 to common shareholders and Common Unit holders of record as of January 6, 2017. Future dividends are at the discretion of the Board of Trustees.\nOther short-term liquidity needs include expenditures for tenant improvements, external leasing commissions and recurring capital expenditures. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred $9.3 million of costs for tenant improvements and external leasing commissions (excluding first generation space and development and redevelopment properties) and $1.6 million of costs for recurring capital expenditures on our operating properties We currently anticipate incurring approximately $11 million\nto $13 million of additional major tenant improvements and renovation costs within the next 12 months at a number of our operating properties.\nWe have 10 properties in our 3-R initiative that are currently under construction. Total estimated costs of this construction are expected to be in the range of $58.0 million to $66.5 million and are expected to be incurred through mid-2018. We expect to be able to fund these costs largely from operating cash flow.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had two development projects under construction. The total estimated cost of the development projects is approximately $90.6 million, of which $82.9 million had been incurred as of December 31, 2016. We currently anticipate incurring the remaining $7.7 million of costs over the next 18 months. We believe we currently have sufficient financing in place to fund these projects and expect to do so primarily through borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility.\nLong-Term Liquidity Needs\nOur long-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for any new development projects, redevelopment of existing properties, non-recurring capital expenditures, acquisitions of properties, and payment of indebtedness at maturity.\nPotential Redevelopment, Reposition, Repurpose Opportunities. We are currently evaluating additional redevelopment, repositioning, and repurposing of several other operating properties as part of our 3-R initiative. Total estimated costs of these properties are expected to be in the range of $80 million to $100 million. We believe we will have sufficient funding for these projects through cash flow from operations and borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility.\nSelective Acquisitions, Developments and Joint Ventures. We may selectively pursue the acquisition and development of other properties, which would require additional capital. It is unlikely that we would have sufficient funds on hand to meet these long-term capital requirements. We would have to satisfy these needs through additional borrowings, sales of common or preferred shares, issuance of Operating Partnership units, cash generated through property dispositions or future property acquisitions and/or participation in joint venture arrangements. We cannot be certain that we would have access to these sources of capital on satisfactory terms, if at all, to fund our long-term liquidity requirements. We evaluate all future opportunities against pre-established criteria including, but not limited to, location, demographics, expected return, tenant credit quality, tenant relationships, and amount of existing retail space. Our ability to access the capital markets will be dependent on a number of factors, including general capital market conditions.\nCapitalized Expenditures on Consolidated Properties\nThe following table summarizes cash capital expenditures for our development and redevelopment properties and other capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2016 and on a cumulative basis since the project's inception:\nTable 220: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year to Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Cumulative\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Developments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,986\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82,935\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Under Construction 3-R Projects\n</td> <td>25,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3-R Opportunities\n</td> <td>4,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Recently completed developments/redevelopments1\n</td> <td>43,949\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Miscellaneous other activity, net\n</td> <td>7,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Recurring operating capital expenditures (primarily tenant improvement payments)\n</td> <td>8,826\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>94,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82,935\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 221: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>____________________\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1\n</td> <td>This classification includes Holly Springs Towne Center - Phase II, Tamiami Crossing, and Cool Springs Market.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe capitalize certain indirect costs such as interest, payroll, and other general and administrative costs related to these development activities. If we were to experience a 10% reduction in development and redevelopment activities, without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs, we would have recorded additional expense of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nImpact of Changes in Credit Ratings on Our Liquidity\nIn 2014, we were assigned investment grade corporate credit ratings from two nationally recognized credit rating agencies. These ratings remain unchanged at December 31, 2016.\nThe ratings could change based upon, among other things, the impact that prevailing economic conditions may have on our results of operations and financial condition. Credit rating reductions by one or more rating agencies could also adversely affect our access to funding sources, the cost and other terms of obtaining funding, as well as our overall financial condition, operating results and cash flow.\nCash Flows\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents on hand of $19.9 million. We may be subject to concentrations of credit risk with regard to our cash and cash equivalents. We place our cash and short-term cash investments with high-credit-quality financial institutions. While we attempt to limit our exposure at any point in time, occasionally, such cash and investments may temporarily be in excess of FDIC and SIPC insurance limits. We also maintain certain compensating balances in several financial institutions in support of borrowings from those institutions. Such compensating balances were not material to the consolidated balance sheets.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2016 to the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nCash provided by operating activities was $154.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $14.4 million from the same period of 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the timing of real estate tax payments and annual insurance payments and an increase in leasing costs.\nCash used in investing activities was $82.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to cash used in investing activities of $84.4 million in the same period of 2015.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and Item 1A, Risk Factors,\u201d appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In this discussion, unless the context suggests otherwise, references to our Company,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d and our\u201d mean Kite Realty Group Trust and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including Kite Realty Group, L.P.\nOverview\nIn the following overview, we discuss, among other things, the status of our business and properties, the effect that current United States economic conditions is having on our retail tenants and us, and the current state of the financial markets and how it impacts our financing strategy.\nOur Business and Properties\nKite Realty Group Trust is a publicly-held real estate investment trust which, through its majority-owned subsidiary, Kite Realty Group, L.P., owns interests in various operating subsidiaries and joint ventures engaged in the ownership, operation,\nacquisition, development, and redevelopment of high-quality neighborhood and community shopping centers in selected markets in the United States. We derive revenues primarily from activities associated with the collection of contractual rents and reimbursement payments from tenants at our properties. Our operating results therefore depend materially on, among other things, the ability of our tenants to make required lease payments, the health and resilience of the United States retail sector, interest rate volatility, job growth and overall economic and real estate market conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we owned interests in 119 operating and redevelopment properties consisting of 108 retail properties, nine retail redevelopment properties, one office operating property and an associated parking garage. We also owned two development projects under construction as of this date.\nPortfolio Update\nIn evaluating acquisition, development, and redevelopment opportunities, we look for strong sub-markets where average household income is above the broader market average. We also focus on locations with population density, high traffic counts, and strong daytime workforce populations. Household incomes in our largest sub-markets are significantly higher than the medians for those broader markets.\nIn 2016, we transitioned the Holly Springs Towne Center - Phase II and Tamiami Crossing development projects to the operating portfolio. We also began construction on our expansion of Holly Springs - Phase II in the fourth quarter. Our 3-R initiative, which includes a total of 20 existing and potential projects, continued to progress in 2016. Ten of these projects are under construction with total estimated costs of $58.0 million to $66.5 million and estimated combined returns of 9.0% to 10.0%. There are 10 additional projects under active evaluation with potential estimated costs of $80 to $100 million and potential returns of 9.0% to 11.0%. We completed construction on four 3-R projects during the fourth quarter: Hitchcock Plaza, Shops at Moore, Tarpon Bay Plaza, and Traders Point.\nIn addition to targeting sub-markets with strong consumer demographics, we focus on having the appropriate tenant mix at each center. Many of our tenants are service-oriented or have a prominent online platform that has reduced the impact of the expansion of e-commerce on their operations. We have aggressively targeted and executed leases with notable grocers including Publix, Trader Joes, and Aldi along with soft goods retailers such as Ross Dress for Less, Ulta and Nordstrom Rack. Additionally, we have identified cost-efficient ways to optimize space for junior anchors such as right-sizing office supply stores and backfilling the existing space with a tenant more suitable to the larger space. In addition, many of our redevelopment projects include consolidating small shop space to accommodate construction of new junior anchor space.\nCapital and Financing Activities\nOur ability to obtain capital on satisfactory terms and to refinance borrowings as they mature is affected by the condition of the economy in general and by the financial strength of properties securing borrowings.\nThroughout 2016, we strengthened our balance sheet by retiring multiple property-level secured loans and unencumbering the related assets securing the loans. We increased our liquidity through amending our existing unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured term loan, which allows us the option to increase the borrowing capacity of the unsecured revolving credit facility to $1 billion and the option to increase our unsecured term loan to provide for an additional $200 million. We also issued $300 million of Notes in a public offering. As of December 31, 2016, we have reduced our term maturities through 2020 to approximately $90 million and extended our weighted-average debt maturities to 6.4 years.\nThe amount that we may borrow under our unsecured revolving credit facility is limited by the value of the assets in our unencumbered asset pool. As of December 31, 2016, the value of the assets in our unencumbered asset pool was $420.4 million. Taking into account outstanding borrowings and letters of credit, we had $409.9 million available under our unsecured revolving credit facility for future borrowings as of December 31, 2016. In addition, we had $19.9 million in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2016.\nThe unencumbering of a number of properties, drawing the remaining amount on our 7-Year Term Loan, amending our existing unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured term loan and issuing the Notes provides us with more flexibility for future capital activity. In addition, the investment grade credit ratings we received in 2014 provide us with access to the unsecured public bond market, which we may continue to use in the future to finance acquisition activity, repay debt maturing in the near term and fix interest rates.\nSummary of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. As disclosed in Note 2, the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the compilation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, subjective, and complex judgments.\nValuation of Investment Properties\nManagement reviews operational and development projects, land parcels and intangible assets for impairment on at least a quarterly basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. The review for possible impairment requires management to make certain assumptions and estimates and requires significant judgment. Impairment losses for investment properties and intangible assets are measured when the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the investment properties during the expected holding period are less than the carrying amounts of those assets. Impairment losses are recorded as the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the asset. Our impairment review for land and development properties assumes we have the intent and the ability to complete the developments or projected uses for the land parcels. If we determine those plans will not be completed or our assumptions with respect to operating assets are not realized, an impairment loss may be appropriate.\nDepreciation may be accelerated for a redevelopment project, including partial demolition of existing structures after the asset is assessed for impairment.\nOperating properties will be classified as held for sale only when those properties are available for immediate sale in their present condition and for which management believes it is probable that a sale of the property will be completed within one year, among other factors. Operating properties classified as held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell. Depreciation and amortization are suspended during the held-for-sale period.\nOur operating properties have operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished from the rest of our activities. Historically, the operations reported in discontinued operations include those operating properties that were sold or were considered held for sale and for which operations and cash flows can be clearly distinguished. The operations from these properties are eliminated from ongoing operations, and we will not have a continuing involvement after disposition. In the first quarter of 2014, we adopted the provisions of ASU 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity, which will result in fewer real estate sales being classified within discontinued operations, as only disposals representing a strategic shift in operations will be presented as discontinued operations. All operating properties included in discontinued operations in 2014 were classified as such prior to the adoption of ASU 2014-08, and no properties that have been sold, or designated as held-for-sale, since the adoption of ASU 2014-08, have met the revised criteria for classification within discontinued operations.\nAcquisition of Real Estate Investments\nUpon acquisition of real estate operating properties, we estimate the fair value of acquired identifiable tangible assets and identified intangible assets and liabilities, assumed debt, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the date of acquisition, based on evaluation of information and estimates available at that date. Based on these estimates, we record the estimated fair value to the applicable assets and liabilities. In making estimates of fair values, a number of sources are utilized, including information obtained as a result of pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing and leasing activities. The estimates of fair value were determined to have primarily relied upon Level 2 and Level 3 inputs, as defined below.\nFair value is determined for tangible assets and intangibles, including:\n \u2022 the fair value of the building on an as-if-vacant basis and the fair value of land determined either by comparable market data, real estate tax assessments, independent appraisals or other relevant data; \n \u2022 above-market and below-market in-place lease values for acquired properties, which are based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) management's estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over the remaining non-cancelable term of the leases. Any below-market renewal options are also considered in the in-place lease values. The capitalized above-market and below-market lease values are amortized as a reduction of or addition to rental income over the term of the lease. Should a tenant vacate, terminate its lease, or otherwise notify us of its intent to do so, the unamortized portion of the lease intangibles would be charged or credited to income; \n \u2022 the value of having a lease in place at the acquisition date. We utilize independent and internal sources for our estimates to determine the respective in-place lease values. Our estimates of value are made using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers. Factors we consider in our analysis include an estimate of costs to execute similar leases including tenant improvements, leasing commissions and foregone costs and rent received during the estimated lease-up period as if the space was vacant. The value of in-place leases is amortized to expense over the remaining initial terms of the respective leases; and \n \u2022 the fair value of any assumed financing that is determined to be above or below market terms. We utilize third party and independent sources for our estimates to determine the respective fair value of each mortgage payable. The fair market value of each mortgage payable is amortized to interest expense over the remaining initial terms of the respective loan. \nWe also consider whether there is any value to in-place leases that have a related customer relationship intangible value. Characteristics we consider in determining these values include the nature and extent of existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant's credit quality, and expectations of lease renewals, among other factors. To date, a tenant relationship has not been developed that is considered to have a current intangible value.\nWe finalize the measurement period of our business combinations when all facts and circumstances are understood, but in no circumstances will the measurement period exceed one year.\nRevenue Recognition\nAs a lessor of real estate assets, the Company retains substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership and account for its leases as operating leases.\nContractual rent, percentage rent, and expense reimbursements from tenants for common area maintenance costs, insurance and real estate taxes are our principal sources of revenue. Base minimum rents are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective leases. Certain lease agreements contain provisions that grant additional rents based on a tenant's sales volume (contingent overage rent). Overage rent is recognized when tenants achieve the specified sales targets as defined in their lease agreements. Overage rent is included in other property related revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. As a result of generating this revenue, we will routinely have accounts receivable due from tenants. We are subject to\ntenant defaults and bankruptcies that may affect the collection of outstanding receivables. To address the collectability of these receivables, we analyze historical write-off experience, tenant credit-worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts and straight line rent reserve. Although we estimate uncollectible receivables and provide for them through charges against income, actual experience may differ from those estimates.\nGains or losses from sales of real estate are recognized when a sale has been consummated, the buyer's initial and continuing investment is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the asset, we have transferred to the buyer the usual risks and rewards of ownership, and we do not have a substantial continuing financial involvement in the property. As part of our ongoing business strategy, we will, from time to time, sell land parcels and outlots, some of which are ground leased to tenants.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe follow the framework established under accounting standard FASB ASC 820 for measuring fair value of non-financial assets and liabilities that are not required or permitted to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis but only in certain circumstances, such as a business combination or upon determination of impairment.\nAssets and liabilities recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets are categorized based on the inputs to the valuation techniques as follows:\n \u2022 Level 1 fair value inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments to which we have access. \n \u2022 Level 2 fair value inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for similar instruments, either directly or indirectly, and appropriately consider counterparty creditworthiness in the valuations. \n \u2022 Level 3 fair value inputs reflect our best estimate of inputs and assumptions market participants would use in pricing an instrument at the measurement date. The inputs are unobservable in the market and significant to the valuation estimate. \nIn instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. As discussed in Note 10 to the Financial Statements, we have determined that its derivative valuations are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nCash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, escrows and deposits, and other working capital balances approximate fair value.\nNote 7 to the Financial Statements includes a discussion of the fair values recorded for assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Note 8 to the Financial Statements includes a discussion of the fair values recorded when we recognized an impairment charge on our Shops at Otty operating property. Level 3 inputs to these transactions include our estimations of market leasing rates, tenant-related costs, discount rates, and disposal values.\nIncome Taxes and REIT Compliance\nParent Company\nThe Parent Company, which is considered a corporation for federal income tax purposes, has been organized and intends to continue to operate in a manner that will enable it to maintain its qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. As a result, it generally will not be subject to federal income tax on the earnings that it distributes to the extent it distributes its REIT taxable income\u201d (determined before the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains) to shareholders of the Parent Company and meets certain other requirements on a recurring basis. To the extent that it satisfies this distribution requirement, but distributes less than 100% of its taxable income, it will be subject to federal corporate income tax on its undistributed REIT taxable income. REITs are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements. If the Parent Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it will be subject to federal income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates for a period of four years following the year in which qualification is lost. We may also be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income even if the Parent Company does qualify as a REIT. The Operating Partnership intends to continue to make distributions to the Parent Company in amounts sufficient to assist the Parent Company in adhering to REIT requirements and maintaining its REIT status.\nWe have elected to treat Kite Realty Holdings, LLC as a taxable REIT subsidiary of the Operating Partnership, and we may elect to treat other subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries in the future. This election enables us to receive income and provide services that would otherwise be impermissible for a REIT. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of assets and liabilities at the tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nOperating Partnership\nThe allocated share of income and loss, other than the operations of our taxable REIT subsidiary, is included in the income tax returns of the Operating Partnership's partners. Accordingly, the only federal income taxes included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements are in connection with its taxable REIT subsidiary.\nInflation\nInflation rates have been near historical lows in recent years and, therefore, have not had a significant impact on our results of operations. Most of our leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation by requiring the tenant to pay its share of operating expenses, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, or include a fixed amount for these costs that escalates over time, thereby reducing our exposure to increases in operating expenses resulting from inflation. Also, most of our leases have original terms of fewer than ten years, which enables us to adjust rental rates to market upon lease renewal.\nResults of Operations\nAs of December 31, 2016, we owned interests in 119 properties and two development projects currently under construction.

We define NOI as income from our real estate including lease termination fees received from tenants less our property operating expenses. NOI excludes amortization of capitalized tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions and corporate level expenses.\nWe believe that NOI, is helpful to investors as a measure of our operating performance because it excludes various items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of our operating performance, such as depreciation and amortization, interest expense, and impairment, if any. We believe that Same Property NOI is helpful to investors as a measure of our operating performance because it includes only the NOI of properties that have been owned for the full period presented, which eliminates disparities in net income due to the redevelopment, acquisition or disposition of properties during the particular period presented and thus provides a more consistent metric for the comparison of our properties. NOI and Same Property NOI should not, however, be considered as alternatives to net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) as indicators of our financial performance. Our computation of Same Property NOI may differ from the methodology used by other REITs, and therefore, may not be comparable to such other REITs.\nWhen evaluating the properties that are included in the same property pool, we have established specific criteria for determining the inclusion of properties acquired or those recently under development. An acquired property is included in the same property pool when there is a full quarter of operations in both years subsequent to the acquisition date. Development and redevelopment properties are included in the same property pool 12 months after construction is substantially complete and the properties have been transferred to the operating portfolio. A redevelopment property is first excluded from the same property pool when the execution of a redevelopment plan is likely and we begin recapturing space from tenants. During various periods in 2016, between nine and 13 properties were excluded from the same property pool that were owned in both comparable periods but did not meet the criteria for inclusion in the same property pool.\nThe following table reflects Same Property NOI1 and a reconciliation to net income attributable to common shareholders for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (unaudited):\nTable 204: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leased percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Economic Occupancy percentage2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net operating income -

Calculated as a weighted average based on the timing of cash rent commencement during the period. 3 Same Property NOI excludes net gains from outlot sales, straight-line rent revenue, bad debt expense and recoveries, lease termination fees, amortization of lease intangibles and significant prior period expense recoveries and adjustments, if any. 4 Includes non-cash activity across the portfolio as well as net operating income from properties not included in the same property pool. \nOur Same Property NOI increased 2.9% in 2016 compared to 2015. This increase was primarily due to increases in rental rates, increase in economic occupancy, and improved expense control and operating expense recovery resulting in an improvement in net recoveries of $1.9 million.\nFunds From Operations\nFFO is a widely used performance measure for real estate companies and is provided here as a supplemental measure of operating performance. We calculate FFO, a non-GAAP financial measure, in accordance with the best practices described in the April 2002 National Policy Bulletin of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\"). The NAREIT white paper defines FFO as net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales and impairments of depreciated property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.\nConsidering the nature of our business as a real estate owner and operator, we believe that FFO is helpful to investors in measuring our operational performance because it excludes various items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of our operating performance, such as gains or losses from sales of depreciated property and depreciation and amortization, which can make periodic and peer analyses of operating performance more difficult. For informational purposes, we have also provided FFO adjusted for a severance charge, accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs, a debt extinguishment loss and transaction costs in 2016, a non-cash adjustment for redemption of preferred shares in 2015, a gain on the resolution of an assumed contingency in 2015, and a gain on settlement and transaction costs in 2015. We believe this supplemental information provides a meaningful measure of our operating performance. We believe our presentation of FFO, as adjusted, provides investors with another financial measure that may facilitate comparison of operating performance between periods and among our peer companies. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of our financial performance, is not an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, and is not indicative of funds available to satisfy our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions. Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do.\nOur calculations of FFO1 and reconciliation to consolidated net income and FFO, as adjusted for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (unaudited) are as follows:\nTable 206: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated net income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,315\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4,676\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: cash dividends on preferred shares\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,877\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,456\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: non-cash adjustment for redemption of preferred shares\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,797\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,844\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,854\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,435\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: gains on sales of operating properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,253\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,066\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,776\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: impairment charge\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,592\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: depreciation and amortization of consolidated entities, net of noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>173,578\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>166,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>120,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> FFO of the Operating Partnership1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>170,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>179,822\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Limited Partners' interests in FFO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,872\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,789\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,541\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> FFO attributable to Kite Realty Group Trust common shareholders1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>166,725\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>176,033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>91,568\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO of the Operating Partnership1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>170,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>179,822\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>94,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: gain on settlement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,520\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs (non-cash)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,121\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: transaction costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: severance charge\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: adjustment for redemption of preferred shares (non-cash)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,797\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: gain from release of assumed earnout liability (non-cash)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,832\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add (less): loss (gain) on debt extinguishment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>819\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,645\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO, as adjusted, of the Operating Partnership\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>175,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>170,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>121,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n ____________________ 1 FFO of the Operating Partnership\" measures 100% of the operating performance of the Operating Partnership's real estate properties. FFO attributable to Kite Realty Group Trust common shareholders\u201d reflects a reduction for the redeemable noncontrolling weighted average diluted interest in the Operating Partnership. \nEarnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA)\nWe define EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, as net income before depreciation and amortization, interest expense and income tax expense of taxable REIT subsidiary. For informational purposes, we have also provided Adjusted EBITDA, which we define as EBITDA less (i) EBITDA from unconsolidated entities, (ii) gains on sales of operating properties or impairment charges, (iii) other income and expense, (iv) noncontrolling interest EBITDA and (v) other non-recurring activity or items impacting comparability from period to period. Annualized Adjusted EBITDA is Adjusted EBITDA for the most recent quarter multiplied by four. Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA is our share of net debt divided by Annualized Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Annualized Adjusted EBITDA and Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA, as calculated by us, are not comparable to EBITDA and EBITDA-related measures reported by other REITs that do not define EBITDA and EBITDA-related measures exactly as we do. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Annualized Adjusted EBITDA do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered alternatives to net income as an indicator of performance or as alternatives to cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of liquidity.\nConsidering the nature of our business as a real estate owner and operator, we believe that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and the ratio of Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA are helpful to investors in measuring our operational performance because they exclude various items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of our operating performance, such as gains or losses from sales of depreciated property and depreciation and amortization, which can make periodic and peer analyses of operating performance more difficult. For informational purposes, we have also provided Annualized Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted as described above. We believe this supplemental information provides a meaningful measure of our operating performance. We believe presenting EBITDA and the related measures in this manner allows investors and other interested parties to form a more meaningful assessment of our operating results.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of our EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Annualized Adjusted EBITDA to consolidated net income (the most directly comparable GAAP measure) and a calculation of Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA.\nTable 208: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments to net income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,613\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense of taxable REIT subsidiary\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64,503\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments to EBITDA:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unconsolidated EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sales of operating properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,059\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income and expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noncontrolling interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(461\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annualized Adjusted EBITDA1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>240,368\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Company share of net debt:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage and other indebtedness\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,731,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Partner share of consolidated joint venture debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13,737\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28,911\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Debt Premium\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(676\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Company Share of Net Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,687,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.0x\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n ____________________ 1 Represents Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended December 31, 2016 (as shown in the table above) multiplied by four. \nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nThe comparability of results of operations is affected by our acquisitions of Colleyville Downs, Belle Isle Station, Livingston Shopping Center, and Chapel Hill Shopping Center in the second and third quarters of 2015 and the sales of seven operating properties in March 2015, two operating properties in December 2015, and two operating properties in early 2016.

<td>$\n</td> <td>10,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe net increase of $3.0 million in rental income for properties fully operational during 2015 and 2016 is primarily attributable to an increase in rental rates, increase in economic occupancy percentage, and improved expense control and operating expense recovery resulting in an improvement in net recoveries of $1.9 million.\nThe average rents for new comparable leases signed in 2016 were $20.83 per square foot compared to average expiring rents of $17.57 per square foot in that period. The average rents for renewals signed in 2016 were $15.85 per square foot compared to average expiring rents of $14.79 per square foot in that period. Our same property economic occupancy improved to 93.4% as of December 31, 2016 from 92.9% as of December 31, 2015. For our retail operating portfolio, annualized base rent per square foot improved to $15.53 per square foot as of December 31, 2016, up from $15.22 per square foot as of December 31, 2015.\nOther property related revenue primarily consists of parking revenues, overage rent, lease termination income and gains on sales of undepreciated assets. This revenue decreased by $3.4 million, primarily as a result lower gains on sales of undepreciated assets of $1.7 million, decreases of $1.1 million in lease termination income, and fluctuations in other miscellaneous activities.\nProperty operating expenses decreased $2.1 million, or 4.1%, due to the following:\nTable 212: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>Net change 2015 to 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties acquired during 2015\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Development properties that became operational or were partially operational in 2015 and/or 2016\n</td> <td>683\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties sold during 2015 and 2016\n</td> <td>(1,288\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties under redevelopment during 2015 and/or 2016\n</td> <td>(444\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties fully operational during 2015 and 2016 and other\n</td> <td>(2,578\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,050\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe net $2.6 million decrease for properties fully operational during 2015 and 2016 is primarily due to a combination of decreases of $1.2 million in bad debt expense, $0.8 million in trash removal expense as tenants began contracting for this item directly with outside vendors, $0.5 million in insurance costs as we generated efficiencies with our larger operating platform, $0.3 million in utility expense, and $0.2 million in snow removal expense. The decreases were offset by an increase of $0.5 million in landscaping expense.\nAs a percentage of revenue, property operating expenses decreased between years from 14.4% to 13.5%. The decrease was mostly due to an improvement in expense control and an improvement in operating expense recoveries from tenants as a result of higher occupancy rates.\nReal estate taxes increased $1.9 million, or 4.7%, due to the following:\nTable 213: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>Net change 2015 to 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties acquired during 2015\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Development properties that became operational or were partially operational in 2015 and/or 2016\n</td> <td>372\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties sold during 2015 and 2016\n</td> <td>(636\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties under redevelopment during 2015 and/or 2016\n</td> <td>(127\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties fully operational during 2015 and 2016 and other\n</td> <td>908\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,934\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe net $0.9 million increase in real estate taxes for properties fully operational during 2015 and 2016 is due to higher tax assessments at certain operating properties. The majority of our real estate tax expense is recoverable from tenants and reflected in tenant reimbursement revenue.\nGeneral, administrative and other expenses increased $1.9 million, or 10.1%. The increase is due primarily to higher payroll costs and company overhead expenses of $1.4 million and a severance charge of $0.5 million in the first quarter of 2016.\nTransaction costs generally consist of legal, lender, due diligence, and other expenses for professional services. Such costs increased $1.2 million as we had terminated transaction costs of $2.8 million in 2016, compared to property acquisition costs of $1.6 million over the same period in 2015.\nWe recorded a non-cash gain from the release of an assumed earnout liability of $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The expiration date of the underlying third party earnout agreement was December 28, 2015, and the original sellers were unable to perform the necessary leasing activity by this date that would have resulted in payment by us of the previously recorded obligation.\nWe recorded an impairment charge of $1.6 million related to our Shops at Otty operating property for the year ended December 31, 2015. This charge was recorded due to our intent to sell the property in the near term, which shortened the intended holding period. This property was sold in the second quarter of 2016. See additional discussion in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $7.3 million, or 4.3%, due to the following:\nTable 214: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>Net change 2015 to 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties acquired during 2015\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Development properties that became operational or were partially operational in 2015 and/or 2016\n</td> <td>4,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties sold during 2015 and 2016\n</td> <td>(1,603\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties under redevelopment during 2015 and/or 2016\n</td> <td>2,434\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties fully operational during 2015 and 2016 and other\n</td> <td>(1,914\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe net increase of $2.4 million in properties under redevelopment during 2015 and 2016 is primarily due to an increase of $1.9 million in accelerated depreciation and amortization from the demolition of a portion of a building at one of our redevelopment properties. The net decrease of $1.9 million in depreciation at properties fully operational during 2015 and 2016 is due to a decrease in accelerated depreciation and amortization on tenant-specific assets from multiple tenants vacating at several operating properties in 2016, compared to the same period in 2015.\nInterest expense increased $9.1 million or 16.2%. The increase is due to recording $1.0 million in accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs from amending the unsecured term loans, retiring Term Loan A and securing longer-term fixed rate debt through the issuance of senior unsecured notes in the second half of 2015 and in the third quarter of 2016 that carried higher interest rates than the variable rate on our unsecured revolving credit facility, which was paid down with the proceeds. We also redeemed all of our outstanding preferred shares in the fourth quarter of 2015 using the proceeds from the senior unsecured notes. The increase is also due to certain development projects, including Parkside Town Commons - Phase I and Holly Springs Towne Center - Phase II becoming operational. As a portion of the project becomes operational, we cease capitalization of the related interest expense.\nWe recorded a non-cash gain on debt extinguishment of $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, related to the retirement of the $90 million loan secured by our City Center operating property.\nWe recorded a gain on settlement of $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, related to the settlement of a dispute related to eminent domain and related damages at one of our operating properties. See additional discussion in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nThe comparability of results of operations is affected by our Merger with Inland Diversified and the acquisition of Rampart Commons in 2014, the acquisitions of Colleyville Downs, Belle Isle Station, Livingston Shopping Center, and Chapel Hill Shopping Center in 2015 and the sale of 15 properties sold in late 2014 and early 2015.

rental income for properties fully operational in both years is primarily attributable to an increase in rental rates, and an improvement in economic occupancy.\nThe average rents for new comparable leases signed in 2015 were $20.23 per square foot compared to average expiring rents of $16.59 per square foot in that period. The average rents for renewals signed in 2015 were $12.58 per square foot compared to average expiring rents of $11.53 per square foot in that period. Our same property economic occupancy improved to 93.9% as of December 31, 2015 from 93.7% as of December 31, 2014. For our retail operating portfolio, annualized base rent per square foot improved to $15.22 per square foot as of December 31, 2015, up from $15.15 per square foot as of December 31, 2014.\nOther property related revenue primarily consists of parking revenues, overage rent, specialty leasing income, lease termination income and gains related to sales of land parcels peripheral to our properties. This revenue increased by $5.7 million, primarily as a result of higher gains on land sales of $4.1 million, an increase of $0.5 million in specialty leasing income, an increase of $0.5 million in lease termination income and an increase in overage rent of $0.3 million.\nProperty operating expenses increased $11.3 million, or 29.1%, due to the following:\nTable 217: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>Net change 2014 to 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties acquired during 2014 or 2015 and retained\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Development properties that became operational or were partially operational in 2014 and/or 2015\n</td> <td>767\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties sold during 2014 or 2015 including properties acquired in the Merger\n</td> <td>(1,616\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties under redevelopment during 2014 and/or 2015 including properties acquired in the Merger\n</td> <td>1,811\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties fully operational during 2014 and 2015 and other\n</td> <td>432\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe net $0.4 million increase for properties fully operational is due to an increase of $1.5 million in on-site personnel and regional office costs, $0.7 million in bad debt expense, and $0.2 million in marketing costs, offset by a decrease of $0.5 million in insurance costs as we leveraged our larger operating platform, $1.1 million in repair and maintenance costs, and $0.4 million in snow removal costs.\nProperty operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 were 14.4% compared to 14.9% over the same period in the prior year. The decrease was mostly due to higher other property related revenue and an improvement in expense recoveries from tenants as a result of higher economic occupancy rates. The overall recovery ratio for reimbursable expenses improved to 87.1% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 85.3% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nReal estate taxes increased $11.0 million, or 36.6%, due to the following:\nTable 218: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>Net change 2014 to 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties acquired during 2014 or 2015 and retained\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Development properties that became operational or were partially operational in 2014 and/or 2015\n</td> <td>215\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties sold during 2014 or 2015 including properties acquired in the Merger\n</td> <td>(1,213\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties under redevelopment during 2014 and/or 2015 including properties acquired in the Merger\n</td> <td>1,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties fully operational during 2014 and 2015 and other\n</td> <td>646\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,957\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe net $0.6 million increase in real estate taxes for properties fully operational during 2014 and 2015 is due to higher tax assessments at certain operating properties. The majority of changes in our real estate tax expense is recoverable from tenants and, therefore, reflected in tenant reimbursement revenue.\nGeneral, administrative and other expenses increased $5.7 million, or 43.4%. The increase is due primarily to higher public company costs and personnel costs associated with the Merger. Our employee base increased from 95 full-time employees as of December 31, 2013 to 145 full-time employees as of December 31, 2015.\nTransaction costs in 2014 related almost entirely to our Merger with Inland Diversified and totaled $27.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $1.6 million of costs for various property acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nWe recorded a non-cash gain from the release of an assumed earnout liability of $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The expiration date of the associated earnout liability was December 28, 2015, and the original sellers were unable to perform the necessary leasing activity that would have resulted in payment of the previously estimated obligation.\nWe recorded an impairment charge of $1.6 million related to our Shops at Otty operating property for the year ended December 31, 2015. See additional discussion in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $46.3 million, or 38.3%, due to the following:\nTable 219: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>Net change 2014 to 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties acquired during 2014 or 2015 and retained\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,414\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Development properties that became operational or were partially operational in 2014 and/or 2015\n</td> <td>2,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties sold during 2014 or 2015 including properties acquired in the Merger\n</td> <td>(3,456\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties under redevelopment during 2014 and/or 2015 including properties acquired in the Merger\n</td> <td>3,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties fully operational during 2014 and 2015 and other\n</td> <td>(2,028\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe net $2.0 million decrease in depreciation at properties fully operational during 2014 and 2015 is mainly due to a tenant vacating at an operating property in 2014, which resulted in the acceleration of depreciation and amortization on certain assets.\nInterest expense increased $10.9 million or 24.0%. The increase mainly resulted from our assumption of $859.6 million of debt as part of the Merger with Inland Diversified, in addition to draws on the unsecured revolving credit facility to fund a portion of our 2015 acquisitions. In addition, we secured longer-term fixed rate debt through the issuance of senior unsecured notes that carried higher interest rates than the variable rate on our unsecured revolving credit facility. The increase was also due to certain development projects, including Delray Marketplace and Parkside Town Commons - Phase I becoming operational. As a portion of the project becomes operational, we expense a pro-rata amount of related interest expense.\nWe recorded a non-cash gain on debt extinguishment of $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, related to the retirement of the $90 million loan secured by our City Center operating property.\nWe recorded a gain on settlement of $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, related to the settlement of a dispute related to eminent domain and related damages at one of our operating properties. See additional discussion in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe allocation of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased due to allocations to joint venture partners in certain consolidated properties acquired as part of the Merger with Inland Diversified. These partners are allocated income generally equal to the distribution received from the operations of the properties in which they hold an interest.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur primary finance and capital strategy is to maintain a strong balance sheet with sufficient flexibility to fund our operating and investment activities in a cost-effective manner. We consider a number of factors when evaluating our level of indebtedness and when making decisions regarding additional borrowings or equity offerings, including the estimated value of properties to be developed or acquired, the estimated market value of our properties and the Company as a whole upon placement of the borrowing or offering, and the ability of particular properties to generate cash flow to cover debt service. We will continue to monitor the capital markets and may consider raising additional capital through the issuance of our common or preferred shares, unsecured debt securities, or other securities.\nOur Principal Capital Resources\nFor a discussion of cash generated from operations, see Cash Flows,\u201d beginning on page 74. In addition to cash generated from operations, we discuss below our other principal capital resources.\nThe increased operating cash flows of the Company have substantially enhanced our liquidity position and reduced our borrowing costs. We continue to focus on a balanced approach to growth and staggering debt maturities in order to retain our financial flexibility.\nIn 2016, we drew the remaining $100 million on our $200 million 7-Year Term Loan and used the proceeds to pay down the unsecured revolving credit facility. In addition, we completed a $300 million public offering of 4.00% Senior Notes due October 1, 2026. The net proceeds were utilized to retire both the $200 million Term Loan A and the $75.9 million construction loan secured by our Parkside Town Commons operating property and to fund portions of the retirement of the $25 million loan secured by our Colonial Square and Village Walk operating properties and the $10.4 million loan secured by our Geist Pavilion operating property. We also drew on our unsecured revolving credit facility to fund the retirement of an additional $128.8 million of property level secured debt in 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $409.9 million available under our unsecured revolving credit facility for future borrowings based on the unencumbered asset pool allocated to the unsecured revolving credit facility. We also had $19.9 million in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2016.\nWe were in compliance with all applicable financial covenants under our unsecured revolving credit facility, our unsecured term loans, and our Notes as of December 31, 2016.\nWe have on file with the SEC a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 relating to the offer and sale, from time to time, of an indeterminate amount of equity and debt securities. Equity securities may be offered and sold by the Parent Company, and the net proceeds of any such offerings would be contributed to the Operating Partnership in exchange for additional General Partner Units. Debt securities may be offered and sold by the Operating Partnership with the Operating Partnership receiving the proceeds. From time to time, we may issue securities under this shelf registration statement to fund the repayment of long-term debt upon maturity and for other general corporate purposes.\nWe currently have an at-the-market equity program that allows us to issue new common shares from time to time, with an aggregate offering price of up to $250.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we issued 137,229 common shares at an average price per share of $29.52 pursuant to our at-the-market offering program, generating gross proceeds of approximately $4.1 million and, after deducting commissions and other costs, net proceeds of approximately $3.8 million. We have $245.9 million remaining available for future common share issuances under our current at-the-market equity program.\nIn the future, we will continue to monitor the capital markets and may consider raising additional capital through the issuance of our common shares, preferred shares or other securities. We may also raise capital by disposing of properties, land parcels or other assets that are no longer core components of our growth strategy. The sale price may differ from our carrying value at the time of sale.\nOur Principal Liquidity Needs\nShort-Term Liquidity Needs\nNear-Term Debt Maturities. As of December 31, 2016, we have $6.7 million of debt scheduled to mature in 2017, excluding scheduled monthly principal payments. We have sufficient liquidity to repay this obligation from current resources and our capacity on the unsecured revolving credit facility.\nOther Short-Term Liquidity Needs. The requirements for qualifying as a REIT and for a tax deduction for some or all of the dividends paid to shareholders, necessitate that we distribute at least 90% of our taxable income on an annual basis. Such requirements cause us to have substantial liquidity needs over both the short term and the long term. Our short-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay operating expenses associated with our operating properties, interest expense and scheduled principal payments on our debt, expected dividend payments to our common shareholders and to Common Unit holders, and recurring capital expenditures.\nIn November 2016, our Board of Trustees declared a cash distribution of $0.3025 per common share and Common Unit for the fourth quarter of 2016, which represented a 5.2% increase over our previous quarterly distribution. This distribution was paid on January 13, 2017 to common shareholders and Common Unit holders of record as of January 6, 2017. Future dividends are at the discretion of the Board of Trustees.\nOther short-term liquidity needs include expenditures for tenant improvements, external leasing commissions and recurring capital expenditures. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred $9.3 million of costs for tenant improvements and external leasing commissions (excluding first generation space and development and redevelopment properties) and $1.6 million of costs for recurring capital expenditures on our operating properties We currently anticipate incurring approximately $11 million\nto $13 million of additional major tenant improvements and renovation costs within the next 12 months at a number of our operating properties.\nWe have 10 properties in our 3-R initiative that are currently under construction. Total estimated costs of this construction are expected to be in the range of $58.0 million to $66.5 million and are expected to be incurred through mid-2018. We expect to be able to fund these costs largely from operating cash flow.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had two development projects under construction. The total estimated cost of the development projects is approximately $90.6 million, of which $82.9 million had been incurred as of December 31, 2016. We currently anticipate incurring the remaining $7.7 million of costs over the next 18 months. We believe we currently have sufficient financing in place to fund these projects and expect to do so primarily through borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility.\nLong-Term Liquidity Needs\nOur long-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for any new development projects, redevelopment of existing properties, non-recurring capital expenditures, acquisitions of properties, and payment of indebtedness at maturity.\nPotential Redevelopment, Reposition, Repurpose Opportunities. We are currently evaluating additional redevelopment, repositioning, and repurposing of several other operating properties as part of our 3-R initiative. Total estimated costs of these properties are expected to be in the range of $80 million to $100 million. We believe we will have sufficient funding for these projects through cash flow from operations and borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility.\nSelective Acquisitions, Developments and Joint Ventures. We may selectively pursue the acquisition and development of other properties, which would require additional capital. It is unlikely that we would have sufficient funds on hand to meet these long-term capital requirements. We would have to satisfy these needs through additional borrowings, sales of common or preferred shares, issuance of Operating Partnership units, cash generated through property dispositions or future property acquisitions and/or participation in joint venture arrangements. We cannot be certain that we would have access to these sources of capital on satisfactory terms, if at all, to fund our long-term liquidity requirements. We evaluate all future opportunities against pre-established criteria including, but not limited to, location, demographics, expected return, tenant credit quality, tenant relationships, and amount of existing retail space. Our ability to access the capital markets will be dependent on a number of factors, including general capital market conditions.\nCapitalized Expenditures on Consolidated Properties\nThe following table summarizes cash capital expenditures for our development and redevelopment properties and other capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2016 and on a cumulative basis since the project's inception:\nTable 220: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year to Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Cumulative\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Developments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,986\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82,935\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Under Construction 3-R Projects\n</td> <td>25,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3-R Opportunities\n</td> <td>4,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Recently completed developments/redevelopments1\n</td> <td>43,949\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Miscellaneous other activity, net\n</td> <td>7,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Recurring operating capital expenditures (primarily tenant improvement payments)\n</td> <td>8,826\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>94,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82,935\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n ____________________ 1 This classification includes Holly Springs Towne Center - Phase II, Tamiami Crossing, and Cool Springs Market. \nWe capitalize certain indirect costs such as interest, payroll, and other general and administrative costs related to these development activities. If we were to experience a 10% reduction in development and redevelopment activities, without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs, we would have recorded additional expense of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nImpact of Changes in Credit Ratings on Our Liquidity\nIn 2014, we were assigned investment grade corporate credit ratings from two nationally recognized credit rating agencies. These ratings remain unchanged at December 31, 2016.\nThe ratings could change based upon, among other things, the impact that prevailing economic conditions may have on our results of operations and financial condition. Credit rating reductions by one or more rating agencies could also adversely affect our access to funding sources, the cost and other terms of obtaining funding, as well as our overall financial condition, operating results and cash flow.\nCash Flows\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents on hand of $19.9 million. We may be subject to concentrations of credit risk with regard to our cash and cash equivalents. We place our cash and short-term cash investments with high-credit-quality financial institutions. While we attempt to limit our exposure at any point in time, occasionally, such cash and investments may temporarily be in excess of FDIC and SIPC insurance limits. We also maintain certain compensating balances in several financial institutions in support of borrowings from those institutions. Such compensating balances were not material to the consolidated balance sheets.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2016 to the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nCash provided by operating activities was $154.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $14.4 million from the same period of 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the timing of real estate tax payments and annual insurance payments and an increase in leasing costs.\nCash used in investing activities was $82.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to cash used in investing activities of $84.4 million in the same period of 2015. Highlights of significant cash sources and uses are as follows:\n \u2022 Net proceeds of $14.2 million related to the sale of operating properties in 2016, compared to net proceeds of $170.0 million related to the sale of seven operating properties in March 2015 and the sale of our Four Corner Square and Cornelius Gateway operating properties in December 2015; \n \u2022 There were no property acquisitions in 2016, while there was a net cash outflow of $166.4 million related to acquisitions over the same period in 2015; and \n \u2022 Increase in capital expenditures of $1.8 million, in addition to a decrease in construction payables of $3.0 million. In 2016, we substantially completed construction at our Tamiami Crossing and Holly Springs Towne Center - Phase II development properties, and incurred additional construction costs at several of our redevelopment properties. \nCash used in financing activities was $86.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to cash used in financing activities of $94.9 million in the same period of 2015. Highlights of significant cash sources and uses in 2016 are as follows:\n \u2022 We retired approximately $139 million of secured loans that were secured by multiple operating properties via draws on our unsecured revolving credit facility; \n \u2022 We issued $300 million of our Notes in a public offering. The net proceeds of which were utilized to retire both the $200 million Term Loan A and the $75.9 million construction loan secured by our Parkside Town Commons operating property and to fund a portion of the retirement of $35 million in secured loans. \n \u2022 We drew the remaining $100 million on our $200 million 7-Year Term Loan and used the proceeds to pay down the unsecured revolving credit facility; \n \u2022 We issued 137,229 of our common shares at an average price per share of $29.52 pursuant to our at-the-market equity program, generating gross proceeds of approximately $4.1 million and, after deducting commissions and other costs, net proceeds of approximately $3.8 million. The proceeds from these offerings were contributed to the Operating Partnership and used to pay down our unsecured revolving credit facility; and \n \u2022 We made distributions to common shareholders and Common Unit holders of $98.6 million. \nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2015 to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nCash provided by operating activities was $169.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $126.8 million from the same period of 2014. The increase was primarily due to the increased cash flows generated by the properties acquired in 2014.\nCash used in investing activities was $84.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to cash provided by investing activities of $186.9 million in the same period of 2014. Highlights of significant cash sources and uses are as follows:\n \u2022 Net proceeds of $170.0 million related to the sale of seven operating properties in early 2015 and the sale of Four Corner and Cornelius Gateway operating properties in December 2015 compared to net proceeds of $191.1 million related to the sale of eight operating properties in late 2014 and the sale of Red Bank Commons, Ridge Plaza, and 50th and 12th operating properties in early 2014; \n \u2022 Net cash outflow of $166.4 million related to 2015 acquisitions compared to a net cash outflow of $22.5 million related to the 2014 acquisition of Rampart Commons; and \n \u2022 Decrease in capital expenditures of $2.0 million, in addition to a decrease in the change in construction payables of $19.5 million. In 2015, there was significant construction activity at Parkside Town Commons - Phase II, Tamiami Crossing, and Holly Springs Towne Center - Phase II. \nCash used in financing activities was $94.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to cash used in financing activities of $203.8 million in the same period of 2014. Highlights of significant cash sources and uses in 2015 are as follows:\n \u2022 We drew $102.6 million on the unsecured revolving credit facility to redeem all the outstanding shares of our Series A Preferred Shares; $59 million to fund a portion of the acquisitions of Colleyville Downs, Belle Isle Station, Livingston Shopping Center and Chapel Hill Shopping Center; $30 million to fund the acquisition of our partner's interest in our City Center operating property; and $14.7 million on construction loans related to development projects; \n \u2022 We retired the $12.2 million loan secured by our Indian River operating property, the $26.2 million loan secured by our Plaza Volente operating property and the $50.1 million loan secured by our Landstown Commons operating property; \n \u2022 We exercised the accordion option feature on the existing unsecured term loan to increase our total borrowings from $230 million to $400 million. The $170 million of proceeds were utilized to pay down our unsecured revolving credit facility by $140 million and to retire loans totaling $30.5 million that were secured by our Draper Peaks and Beacon Hill operating properties; \n \u2022 We issued $250 million of senior unsecured notes; \n \u2022 In September 2015, we paid off the remaining balance of $199.6 million on our unsecured revolving credit facility and the $33 million loan secured by our Crossing at Killingly operating property, using proceeds from the issuance of the senior unsecured notes, and then in December 2015, we entered into a new $33 million loan secured by our Crossing at Killingly operating property; \n \u2022 In connection with the sale of seven properties in March 2015, we retired the $24 million loan secured by the Regal Court property. We paid down our unsecured revolving credit facility by $27 million utilizing a portion of proceeds from these property sales. In addition in December 2015, we paid down our unsecured revolving credit facility utilizing gross proceeds of $44.9 million from the sales of Four Corner Square and Cornelius Gateway; \n \u2022 We entered into a 7-Year Term Loan for up to $200 million, and in December 2015 drew $100 million on the 7-Year Term Loan and used the proceeds to pay down the unsecured revolving credit facility that was initially utilized to retire the $90 million loan secured by our City Center operating property. \n \u2022 Distributions to common shareholders and Common Unit holders of $93.1 million; and \n \u2022 Distributions to preferred shareholders of $8.6 million. \nIn addition to the cash activity above, in August 2015, in connection with the acquisition of Chapel Hill Shopping Center, we assumed a $18.3 million loan secured by the operating property. As part of the estimated fair value determination, a debt premium of $0.2 million was recorded.\nOther Matters\nFinancial Instruments\nWe are exposed to capital market risk, such as changes in interest rates. In order to reduce the volatility relating to interest rate risk, we may enter into interest rate hedging arrangements from time to time. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not currently have any off-balance sheet arrangements that in our opinion have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. We do, however, have certain obligations related to some of the projects in our operating and development properties.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we have outstanding letters of credit totaling $10.5 million and no amounts were advanced against these instruments.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations to third parties based on contracts executed as of December 31, 2016.\nTable 242: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Consolidated\nLong-term\nDebt and Interest1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Development Activity and Tenant\nAllowances2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Operating Ground\nLeases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Employment\nContracts3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,969\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>943\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>87,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,357\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,329\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,338\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>110,401\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>496,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>497,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,294,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57,708\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,351,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,149,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,969\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64,581\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>943\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,223,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n ____________________ 1 Our long-term debt consists of both variable and fixed-rate debt and includes both principal and interest.

The term of each employment agreement expires on June 30, 2017, with automatic one-year renewals each July 1st thereafter unless we or the individual elects not to renew the agreement. \nObligations in Connection with Development and Redevelopment Projects Under Construction\nWe are obligated under various completion guarantees with lenders and lease agreements with tenants to complete all or portions of our in-process development and redevelopment projects. We believe we currently have sufficient financing in place to fund our investment in any existing or future projects through cash from operations and borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility.\nOur share of estimated future costs for our under construction and future developments and redevelopments is further discussed on page 73 in the \"Short and Long-Term Liquidity Needs\" section.\nOutstanding Indebtedness\nThe following table presents details of outstanding consolidated indebtedness as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 adjusted for hedges:\nTable 244: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior unsecured notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>550,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unsecured revolving credit facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unsecured term loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>400,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>500,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Notes payable secured by properties under construction - variable rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>132,776\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage notes payable - fixed rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>587,762\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>756,494\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage notes payable - variable rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>114,388\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58,268\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net debt premiums and issuance costs, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(676\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,911\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total mortgage and other indebtedness\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,731,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,724,449\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsolidated indebtedness, including weighted average maturities and weighted average interest rates at December 31, 2016, is summarized below:\nTable 245: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>Outstanding Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted Average\nMaturity\n(in years)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted Average\nInterest Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Ratio\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed rate debt1\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,612,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.09\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Variable rate debt\n</td> <td>119,696\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.26\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net debt premiums and issuance costs, net\n</td> <td>(676\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,731,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.96\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n ____________________ 1 Fixed rate debt includes, and variable rate date excludes, the portion of such debt that has been hedged by interest rate derivatives.

Mortgage indebtedness is generally repaid in monthly installments of interest and principal and matures over various terms through 2030.\nVariable interest rates on mortgage indebtedness are based on LIBOR plus spreads ranging from 160 to 225 basis points. At December 31, 2016, the one-month LIBOR interest rate was 0.77%. Fixed interest rates on mortgage loans range from 3.78% to 6.78%.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and Item 1A, Risk Factors,\u201d appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In this discussion, unless the context suggests otherwise, references to our Company,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d and our\u201d mean Kite Realty Group Trust and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including Kite Realty Group, L.P.\nOverview\nIn the following overview, we discuss, among other things, the status of our business and properties, the effect that current United States economic conditions is having on our retail tenants and us, and the current state of the financial markets and how it impacts our financing strategy.\nOur Business and Properties\nKite Realty Group Trust is a publicly-held real estate investment trust which, through its majority-owned subsidiary, Kite Realty Group, L.P., owns interests in various operating subsidiaries and joint ventures engaged in the ownership, operation,\nacquisition, development, and redevelopment of high-quality neighborhood and community shopping centers in selected markets in the United States. We derive revenues primarily from activities associated with the collection of contractual rents and reimbursement payments from tenants at our properties. Our operating results therefore depend materially on, among other things, the ability of our tenants to make required lease payments, the health and resilience of the United States retail sector, interest rate volatility, job growth and overall economic and real estate market conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we owned interests in 119 operating and redevelopment properties consisting of 108 retail properties, nine retail redevelopment properties, one office operating property and an associated parking garage. We also owned two development projects under construction as of this date.\nPortfolio Update\nIn evaluating acquisition, development, and redevelopment opportunities, we look for strong sub-markets where average household income is above the broader market average. We also focus on locations with population density, high traffic counts, and strong daytime workforce populations. Household incomes in our largest sub-markets are significantly higher than the medians for those broader markets.\nIn 2016, we transitioned the Holly Springs Towne Center - Phase II and Tamiami Crossing development projects to the operating portfolio. We also began construction on our expansion of Holly Springs - Phase II in the fourth quarter. Our 3-R initiative, which includes a total of 20 existing and potential projects, continued to progress in 2016. Ten of these projects are under construction with total estimated costs of $58.0 million to $66.5 million and estimated combined returns of 9.0% to 10.0%. There are 10 additional projects under active evaluation with potential estimated costs of $80 to $100 million and potential returns of 9.0% to 11.0%. We completed construction on four 3-R projects during the fourth quarter: Hitchcock Plaza, Shops at Moore, Tarpon Bay Plaza, and Traders Point.\nIn addition to targeting sub-markets with strong consumer demographics, we focus on having the appropriate tenant mix at each center. Many of our tenants are service-oriented or have a prominent online platform that has reduced the impact of the expansion of e-commerce on their operations. We have aggressively targeted and executed leases with notable grocers including Publix, Trader Joes, and Aldi along with soft goods retailers such as Ross Dress for Less, Ulta and Nordstrom Rack. Additionally, we have identified cost-efficient ways to optimize space for junior anchors such as right-sizing office supply stores and backfilling the existing space with a tenant more suitable to the larger space. In addition, many of our redevelopment projects include consolidating small shop space to accommodate construction of new junior anchor space.\nCapital and Financing Activities\nOur ability to obtain capital on satisfactory terms and to refinance borrowings as they mature is affected by the condition of the economy in general and by the financial strength of properties securing borrowings.\nThroughout 2016, we strengthened our balance sheet by retiring multiple property-level secured loans and unencumbering the related assets securing the loans. We increased our liquidity through amending our existing unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured term loan, which allows us the option to increase the borrowing capacity of the unsecured revolving credit facility to $1 billion and the option to increase our unsecured term loan to provide for an additional $200 million. We also issued $300 million of Notes in a public offering. As of December 31, 2016, we have reduced our term maturities through 2020 to approximately $90 million and extended our weighted-average debt maturities to 6.4 years.\nThe amount that we may borrow under our unsecured revolving credit facility is limited by the value of the assets in our unencumbered asset pool. As of December 31, 2016, the value of the assets in our unencumbered asset pool was $420.4 million. Taking into account outstanding borrowings and letters of credit, we had $409.9 million available under our unsecured revolving credit facility for future borrowings as of December 31, 2016. In addition, we had $19.9 million in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2016.\nThe unencumbering of a number of properties, drawing the remaining amount on our 7-Year Term Loan, amending our existing unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured term loan and issuing the Notes provides us with more flexibility for future capital activity. In addition, the investment grade credit ratings we received in 2014 provide us with access to the unsecured public bond market, which we may continue to use in the future to finance acquisition activity, repay debt maturing in the near term and fix interest rates.\nSummary of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. As disclosed in Note 2, the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the compilation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, subjective, and complex judgments.\nValuation of Investment Properties\nManagement reviews operational and development projects, land parcels and intangible assets for impairment on at least a quarterly basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. The review for possible impairment requires management to make certain assumptions and estimates and requires significant judgment. Impairment losses for investment properties and intangible assets are measured when the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the investment properties during the expected holding period are less than the carrying amounts of those assets. Impairment losses are recorded as the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the asset. Our impairment review for land and development properties assumes we have the intent and the ability to complete the developments or projected uses for the land parcels. If we determine those plans will not be completed or our assumptions with respect to operating assets are not realized, an impairment loss may be appropriate.\nDepreciation may be accelerated for a redevelopment project, including partial demolition of existing structures after the asset is assessed for impairment.\nOperating properties will be classified as held for sale only when those properties are available for immediate sale in their present condition and for which management believes it is probable that a sale of the property will be completed within one year, among other factors. Operating properties classified as held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell. Depreciation and amortization are suspended during the held-for-sale period.\nOur operating properties have operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished from the rest of our activities. Historically, the operations reported in discontinued operations include those operating properties that were sold or were considered held for sale and for which operations and cash flows can be clearly distinguished. The operations from these properties are eliminated from ongoing operations, and we will not have a continuing involvement after disposition. In the first quarter of 2014, we adopted the provisions of ASU 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity, which will result in fewer real estate sales being classified within discontinued operations, as only disposals representing a strategic shift in operations will be presented as discontinued operations. All operating properties included in discontinued operations in 2014 were classified as such prior to the adoption of ASU 2014-08, and no properties that have been sold, or designated as held-for-sale, since the adoption of ASU 2014-08, have met the revised criteria for classification within discontinued operations.\nAcquisition of Real Estate Investments\nUpon acquisition of real estate operating properties, we estimate the fair value of acquired identifiable tangible assets and identified intangible assets and liabilities, assumed debt, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the date of acquisition, based on evaluation of information and estimates available at that date. Based on these estimates, we record the estimated fair value to the applicable assets and liabilities. In making estimates of fair values, a number of sources are utilized, including information obtained as a result of pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing and leasing activities. The estimates of fair value were determined to have primarily relied upon Level 2 and Level 3 inputs, as defined below.\nFair value is determined for tangible assets and intangibles, including:\n \u2022 the fair value of the building on an as-if-vacant basis and the fair value of land determined either by comparable market data, real estate tax assessments, independent appraisals or other relevant data; \n \u2022 above-market and below-market in-place lease values for acquired properties, which are based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) management's estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over the remaining non-cancelable term of the leases. Any below-market renewal options are also considered in the in-place lease values. The capitalized above-market and below-market lease values are amortized as a reduction of or addition to rental income over the term of the lease. Should a tenant vacate, terminate its lease, or otherwise notify us of its intent to do so, the unamortized portion of the lease intangibles would be charged or credited to income; \n \u2022 the value of having a lease in place at the acquisition date. We utilize independent and internal sources for our estimates to determine the respective in-place lease values. Our estimates of value are made using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers. Factors we consider in our analysis include an estimate of costs to execute similar leases including tenant improvements, leasing commissions and foregone costs and rent received during the estimated lease-up period as if the space was vacant. The value of in-place leases is amortized to expense over the remaining initial terms of the respective leases; and \n \u2022 the fair value of any assumed financing that is determined to be above or below market terms. We utilize third party and independent sources for our estimates to determine the respective fair value of each mortgage payable. The fair market value of each mortgage payable is amortized to interest expense over the remaining initial terms of the respective loan. \nWe also consider whether there is any value to in-place leases that have a related customer relationship intangible value. Characteristics we consider in determining these values include the nature and extent of existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant's credit quality, and expectations of lease renewals, among other factors. To date, a tenant relationship has not been developed that is considered to have a current intangible value.\nWe finalize the measurement period of our business combinations when all facts and circumstances are understood, but in no circumstances will the measurement period exceed one year.\nRevenue Recognition\nAs a lessor of real estate assets, the Company retains substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership and account for its leases as operating leases.\nContractual rent, percentage rent, and expense reimbursements from tenants for common area maintenance costs, insurance and real estate taxes are our principal sources of revenue. Base minimum rents are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective leases. Certain lease agreements contain provisions that grant additional rents based on a tenant's sales volume (contingent overage rent). Overage rent is recognized when tenants achieve the specified sales targets as defined in their lease agreements. Overage rent is included in other property related revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. As a result of generating this revenue, we will routinely have accounts receivable due from tenants. We are subject to\ntenant defaults and bankruptcies that may affect the collection of outstanding receivables. To address the collectability of these receivables, we analyze historical write-off experience, tenant credit-worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts and straight line rent reserve. Although we estimate uncollectible receivables and provide for them through charges against income, actual experience may differ from those estimates.\nGains or losses from sales of real estate are recognized when a sale has been consummated, the buyer's initial and continuing investment is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the asset, we have transferred to the buyer the usual risks and rewards of ownership, and we do not have a substantial continuing financial involvement in the property. As part of our ongoing business strategy, we will, from time to time, sell land parcels and outlots, some of which are ground leased to tenants.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe follow the framework established under accounting standard FASB ASC 820 for measuring fair value of non-financial assets and liabilities that are not required or permitted to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis but only in certain circumstances, such as a business combination or upon determination of impairment.\nAssets and liabilities recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets are categorized based on the inputs to the valuation techniques as follows:\n \u2022 Level 1 fair value inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments to which we have access. \n \u2022 Level 2 fair value inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for similar instruments, either directly or indirectly, and appropriately consider counterparty creditworthiness in the valuations. \n \u2022 Level 3 fair value inputs reflect our best estimate of inputs and assumptions market participants would use in pricing an instrument at the measurement date. The inputs are unobservable in the market and significant to the valuation estimate. \nIn instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. As discussed in Note 10 to the Financial Statements, we have determined that its derivative valuations are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nCash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, escrows and deposits, and other working capital balances approximate fair value.\nNote 7 to the Financial Statements includes a discussion of the fair values recorded for assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Note 8 to the Financial Statements includes a discussion of the fair values recorded when we recognized an impairment charge on our Shops at Otty operating property. Level 3 inputs to these transactions include our estimations of market leasing rates, tenant-related costs, discount rates, and disposal values.\nIncome Taxes and REIT Compliance\nParent Company\nThe Parent Company, which is considered a corporation for federal income tax purposes, has been organized and intends to continue to operate in a manner that will enable it to maintain its qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. As a result, it generally will not be subject to federal income tax on the earnings that it distributes to the extent it distributes its REIT taxable income\u201d (determined before the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains) to shareholders of the Parent Company and meets certain other requirements on a recurring basis. To the extent that it satisfies this distribution requirement, but distributes less than 100% of its taxable income, it will be subject to federal corporate income tax on its undistributed REIT taxable income. REITs are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements. If the Parent Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it will be subject to federal income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates for a period of four years following the year in which qualification is lost. We may also be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income even if the Parent Company does qualify as a REIT. The Operating Partnership intends to continue to make distributions to the Parent Company in amounts sufficient to assist the Parent Company in adhering to REIT requirements and maintaining its REIT status.\nWe have elected to treat Kite Realty Holdings, LLC as a taxable REIT subsidiary of the Operating Partnership, and we may elect to treat other subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries in the future. This election enables us to receive income and provide services that would otherwise be impermissible for a REIT. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of assets and liabilities at the tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nOperating Partnership\nThe allocated share of income and loss, other than the operations of our taxable REIT subsidiary, is included in the income tax returns of the Operating Partnership's partners. Accordingly, the only federal income taxes included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements are in connection with its taxable REIT subsidiary.\nInflation\nInflation rates have been near historical lows in recent years and, therefore, have not had a significant impact on our results of operations. Most of our leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation by requiring the tenant to pay its share of operating expenses, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, or include a fixed amount for these costs that escalates over time, thereby reducing our exposure to increases in operating expenses resulting from inflation. Also, most of our leases have original terms of fewer than ten years, which enables us to adjust rental rates to market upon lease renewal.\nResults of Operations\nAs of December 31, 2016, we owned interests in 119 properties and two development projects currently under construction. The following table sets forth the total operating and redevelopment properties and development projects that we owned as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\n\nThe comparability of results of operations is affected by our Merger with Inland Diversified on July 1, 2014 and by our development, redevelopment, and operating property acquisition and disposition activities in 2014 through 2016. Therefore, we believe it is most useful to review the comparisons of our results of operations for these years (as set forth below under Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\u201d and Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\u201d) in conjunction with the discussion of these activities during those periods, which is set forth below.\nProperty Acquisition Activities\nDuring the three years ended December 31, 2016, we acquired the properties listed in the table below.\n\nOperating Property Disposition Activities\nDuring the three years ended December 31, 2016, we sold the operating properties listed in the table below.\n\n ____________________ 1 Operating property was classified in discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014. 2 Shortly after the Merger with Inland Diversified we identified and sold certain properties located in multiple MSAs that were not consistent with the Company's strategic plan. \nDevelopment Activities\nDuring the three years ended December 31, 2016, the following significant development properties became operational or partially operational:\n\n ____________________ 1 Represents the earlier of 1) the date on which we started receiving rental payments under tenant leases or ground leases at the property or 2) the date the first tenant took possession of its space at the property. \nRedevelopment Activities\nDuring portions of the three years ended December 31, 2016, the following properties were under redevelopment and removed from our operating portfolio:\n\n ____________________ 1 Transition date represents the date the property was transferred from our operating portfolio into redevelopment status. 2 These nine operating properties have been identified as redevelopment properties as they have been excluded from the same property pool. \nNet Operating Income and Same Property Net Operating Income\nWe use property net operating income (\"NOI\"), a non-GAAP financial measure, to evaluate the performance of our properties. We define NOI as income from our real estate including lease termination fees received from tenants less our property operating expenses. NOI excludes amortization of capitalized tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions and corporate level expenses.\nWe believe that NOI, is helpful to investors as a measure of our operating performance because it excludes various items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of our operating performance, such as depreciation and amortization, interest expense, and impairment, if any. We believe that Same Property NOI is helpful to investors as a measure of our operating performance because it includes only the NOI of properties that have been owned for the full period presented, which eliminates disparities in net income due to the redevelopment, acquisition or disposition of properties during the particular period presented and thus provides a more consistent metric for the comparison of our properties. NOI and Same Property NOI should not, however, be considered as alternatives to net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) as indicators of our financial performance. Our computation of Same Property NOI may differ from the methodology used by other REITs, and therefore, may not be comparable to such other REITs.\nWhen evaluating the properties that are included in the same property pool, we have established specific criteria for determining the inclusion of properties acquired or those recently under development. An acquired property is included in the same property pool when there is a full quarter of operations in both years subsequent to the acquisition date. Development and redevelopment properties are included in the same property pool 12 months after construction is substantially complete and the properties have been transferred to the operating portfolio. A redevelopment property is first excluded from the same property pool when the execution of a redevelopment plan is likely and we begin recapturing space from tenants. During various periods in 2016, between nine and 13 properties were excluded from the same property pool that were owned in both comparable periods but did not meet the criteria for inclusion in the same property pool.\nThe following table reflects Same Property NOI1 and a reconciliation to net income attributable to common shareholders for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (unaudited):\n\n ____________________ 1 Same Property NOI excludes operating properties in redevelopment as well as office properties (Thirty South Meridian and Eddy Street Commons). 2 Excludes leases that are signed but under which tenants have not yet commenced the payment of cash rent. Calculated as a weighted average based on the timing of cash rent commencement during the period. 3 Same Property NOI excludes net gains from outlot sales, straight-line rent revenue, bad debt expense and recoveries, lease termination fees, amortization of lease intangibles and significant prior period expense recoveries and adjustments, if any. 4 Includes non-cash activity across the portfolio as well as net operating income from properties not included in the same property pool. \nOur Same Property NOI increased 2.9% in 2016 compared to 2015. This increase was primarily due to increases in rental rates, increase in economic occupancy, and improved expense control and operating expense recovery resulting in an improvement in net recoveries of $1.9 million.\nFunds From Operations\nFFO is a widely used performance measure for real estate companies and is provided here as a supplemental measure of operating performance. We calculate FFO, a non-GAAP financial measure, in accordance with the best practices described in the April 2002 National Policy Bulletin of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\"). The NAREIT white paper defines FFO as net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales and impairments of depreciated property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.\nConsidering the nature of our business as a real estate owner and operator, we believe that FFO is helpful to investors in measuring our operational performance because it excludes various items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of our operating performance, such as gains or losses from sales of depreciated property and depreciation and amortization, which can make periodic and peer analyses of operating performance more difficult. For informational purposes, we have also provided FFO adjusted for a severance charge, accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs, a debt extinguishment loss and transaction costs in 2016, a non-cash adjustment for redemption of preferred shares in 2015, a gain on the resolution of an assumed contingency in 2015, and a gain on settlement and transaction costs in 2015. We believe this supplemental information provides a meaningful measure of our operating performance. We believe our presentation of FFO, as adjusted, provides investors with another financial measure that may facilitate comparison of operating performance between periods and among our peer companies. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of our financial performance, is not an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, and is not indicative of funds available to satisfy our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions. Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do.\nOur calculations of FFO1 and reconciliation to consolidated net income and FFO, as adjusted for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (unaudited) are as follows:\n\n ____________________ 1 FFO of the Operating Partnership\" measures 100% of the operating performance of the Operating Partnership's real estate properties. FFO attributable to Kite Realty Group Trust common shareholders\u201d reflects a reduction for the redeemable noncontrolling weighted average diluted interest in the Operating Partnership. \nEarnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA)\nWe define EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, as net income before depreciation and amortization, interest expense and income tax expense of taxable REIT subsidiary. For informational purposes, we have also provided Adjusted EBITDA, which we define as EBITDA less (i) EBITDA from unconsolidated entities, (ii) gains on sales of operating properties or impairment charges, (iii) other income and expense, (iv) noncontrolling interest EBITDA and (v) other non-recurring activity or items impacting comparability from period to period. Annualized Adjusted EBITDA is Adjusted EBITDA for the most recent quarter multiplied by four. Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA is our share of net debt divided by Annualized Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Annualized Adjusted EBITDA and Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA, as calculated by us, are not comparable to EBITDA and EBITDA-related measures reported by other REITs that do not define EBITDA and EBITDA-related measures exactly as we do. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Annualized Adjusted EBITDA do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered alternatives to net income as an indicator of performance or as alternatives to cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of liquidity.\nConsidering the nature of our business as a real estate owner and operator, we believe that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and the ratio of Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA are helpful to investors in measuring our operational performance because they exclude various items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of our operating performance, such as gains or losses from sales of depreciated property and depreciation and amortization, which can make periodic and peer analyses of operating performance more difficult. For informational purposes, we have also provided Annualized Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted as described above. We believe this supplemental information provides a meaningful measure of our operating performance. We believe presenting EBITDA and the related measures in this manner allows investors and other interested parties to form a more meaningful assessment of our operating results.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of our EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Annualized Adjusted EBITDA to consolidated net income (the most directly comparable GAAP measure) and a calculation of Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA.\n\n ____________________ 1 Represents Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended December 31, 2016 (as shown in the table above) multiplied by four. \nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nThe comparability of results of operations is affected by our acquisitions of Colleyville Downs, Belle Isle Station, Livingston Shopping Center, and Chapel Hill Shopping Center in the second and third quarters of 2015 and the sales of seven operating properties in March 2015, two operating properties in December 2015, and two operating properties in early 2016. The following table reflects changes in the components of our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\n\nRental income (including tenant reimbursements) increased $10.5 million, or 3.1%, due to the following:\n\nThe net increase of $3.0 million in rental income for properties fully operational during 2015 and 2016 is primarily attributable to an increase in rental rates, increase in economic occupancy percentage, and improved expense control and operating expense recovery resulting in an improvement in net recoveries of $1.9 million.\nThe average rents for new comparable leases signed in 2016 were $20.83 per square foot compared to average expiring rents of $17.57 per square foot in that period. The average rents for renewals signed in 2016 were $15.85 per square foot compared to average expiring rents of $14.79 per square foot in that period. Our same property economic occupancy improved to 93.4% as of December 31, 2016 from 92.9% as of December 31, 2015. For our retail operating portfolio, annualized base rent per square foot improved to $15.53 per square foot as of December 31, 2016, up from $15.22 per square foot as of December 31, 2015.\nOther property related revenue primarily consists of parking revenues, overage rent, lease termination income and gains on sales of undepreciated assets. This revenue decreased by $3.4 million, primarily as a result lower gains on sales of undepreciated assets of $1.7 million, decreases of $1.1 million in lease termination income, and fluctuations in other miscellaneous activities.\nProperty operating expenses decreased $2.1 million, or 4.1%, due to the following:\n\nThe net $2.6 million decrease for properties fully operational during 2015 and 2016 is primarily due to a combination of decreases of $1.2 million in bad debt expense, $0.8 million in trash removal expense as tenants began contracting for this item directly with outside vendors, $0.5 million in insurance costs as we generated efficiencies with our larger operating platform, $0.3 million in utility expense, and $0.2 million in snow removal expense. The decreases were offset by an increase of $0.5 million in landscaping expense.\nAs a percentage of revenue, property operating expenses decreased between years from 14.4% to 13.5%. The decrease was mostly due to an improvement in expense control and an improvement in operating expense recoveries from tenants as a result of higher occupancy rates.\nReal estate taxes increased $1.9 million, or 4.7%, due to the following:\n\nThe net $0.9 million increase in real estate taxes for properties fully operational during 2015 and 2016 is due to higher tax assessments at certain operating properties. The majority of our real estate tax expense is recoverable from tenants and reflected in tenant reimbursement revenue.\nGeneral, administrative and other expenses increased $1.9 million, or 10.1%. The increase is due primarily to higher payroll costs and company overhead expenses of $1.4 million and a severance charge of $0.5 million in the first quarter of 2016.\nTransaction costs generally consist of legal, lender, due diligence, and other expenses for professional services. Such costs increased $1.2 million as we had terminated transaction costs of $2.8 million in 2016, compared to property acquisition costs of $1.6 million over the same period in 2015.\nWe recorded a non-cash gain from the release of an assumed earnout liability of $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The expiration date of the underlying third party earnout agreement was December 28, 2015, and the original sellers were unable to perform the necessary leasing activity by this date that would have resulted in payment by us of the previously recorded obligation.\nWe recorded an impairment charge of $1.6 million related to our Shops at Otty operating property for the year ended December 31, 2015. This charge was recorded due to our intent to sell the property in the near term, which shortened the intended holding period. This property was sold in the second quarter of 2016. See additional discussion in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $7.3 million, or 4.3%, due to the following:\n\nThe net increase of $2.4 million in properties under redevelopment during 2015 and 2016 is primarily due to an increase of $1.9 million in accelerated depreciation and amortization from the demolition of a portion of a building at one of our redevelopment properties. The net decrease of $1.9 million in depreciation at properties fully operational during 2015 and 2016 is due to a decrease in accelerated depreciation and amortization on tenant-specific assets from multiple tenants vacating at several operating properties in 2016, compared to the same period in 2015.\nInterest expense increased $9.1 million or 16.2%. The increase is due to recording $1.0 million in accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs from amending the unsecured term loans, retiring Term Loan A and securing longer-term fixed rate debt through the issuance of senior unsecured notes in the second half of 2015 and in the third quarter of 2016 that carried higher interest rates than the variable rate on our unsecured revolving credit facility, which was paid down with the proceeds. We also redeemed all of our outstanding preferred shares in the fourth quarter of 2015 using the proceeds from the senior unsecured notes. The increase is also due to certain development projects, including Parkside Town Commons - Phase I and Holly Springs Towne Center - Phase II becoming operational. As a portion of the project becomes operational, we cease capitalization of the related interest expense.\nWe recorded a non-cash gain on debt extinguishment of $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, related to the retirement of the $90 million loan secured by our City Center operating property.\nWe recorded a gain on settlement of $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, related to the settlement of a dispute related to eminent domain and related damages at one of our operating properties. See additional discussion in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nThe comparability of results of operations is affected by our Merger with Inland Diversified and the acquisition of Rampart Commons in 2014, the acquisitions of Colleyville Downs, Belle Isle Station, Livingston Shopping Center, and Chapel Hill Shopping Center in 2015 and the sale of 15 properties sold in late 2014 and early 2015. The following table reflects income statement line items from our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\n\nRental income (including tenant reimbursements) increased $81.8 million, or 32.4%, due to the following:\n\nThe net increase of $1.0 million in rental income for properties fully operational in both years is primarily attributable to an increase in rental rates, and an improvement in economic occupancy.\nThe average rents for new comparable leases signed in 2015 were $20.23 per square foot compared to average expiring rents of $16.59 per square foot in that period. The average rents for renewals signed in 2015 were $12.58 per square foot compared to average expiring rents of $11.53 per square foot in that period. Our same property economic occupancy improved to 93.9% as of December 31, 2015 from 93.7% as of December 31, 2014. For our retail operating portfolio, annualized base rent per square foot improved to $15.22 per square foot as of December 31, 2015, up from $15.15 per square foot as of December 31, 2014.\nOther property related revenue primarily consists of parking revenues, overage rent, specialty leasing income, lease termination income and gains related to sales of land parcels peripheral to our properties. This revenue increased by $5.7 million, primarily as a result of higher gains on land sales of $4.1 million, an increase of $0.5 million in specialty leasing income, an increase of $0.5 million in lease termination income and an increase in overage rent of $0.3 million.\nProperty operating expenses increased $11.3 million, or 29.1%, due to the following:\n\nThe net $0.4 million increase for properties fully operational is due to an increase of $1.5 million in on-site personnel and regional office costs, $0.7 million in bad debt expense, and $0.2 million in marketing costs, offset by a decrease of $0.5 million in insurance costs as we leveraged our larger operating platform, $1.1 million in repair and maintenance costs, and $0.4 million in snow removal costs.\nProperty operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 were 14.4% compared to 14.9% over the same period in the prior year. The decrease was mostly due to higher other property related revenue and an improvement in expense recoveries from tenants as a result of higher economic occupancy rates. The overall recovery ratio for reimbursable expenses improved to 87.1% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 85.3% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nReal estate taxes increased $11.0 million, or 36.6%, due to the following:\n\nThe net $0.6 million increase in real estate taxes for properties fully operational during 2014 and 2015 is due to higher tax assessments at certain operating properties. The majority of changes in our real estate tax expense is recoverable from tenants and, therefore, reflected in tenant reimbursement revenue.\nGeneral, administrative and other expenses increased $5.7 million, or 43.4%. The increase is due primarily to higher public company costs and personnel costs associated with the Merger. Our employee base increased from 95 full-time employees as of December 31, 2013 to 145 full-time employees as of December 31, 2015.\nTransaction costs in 2014 related almost entirely to our Merger with Inland Diversified and totaled $27.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $1.6 million of costs for various property acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nWe recorded a non-cash gain from the release of an assumed earnout liability of $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The expiration date of the associated earnout liability was December 28, 2015, and the original sellers were unable to perform the necessary leasing activity that would have resulted in payment of the previously estimated obligation.\nWe recorded an impairment charge of $1.6 million related to our Shops at Otty operating property for the year ended December 31, 2015. See additional discussion in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $46.3 million, or 38.3%, due to the following:\n\nThe net $2.0 million decrease in depreciation at properties fully operational during 2014 and 2015 is mainly due to a tenant vacating at an operating property in 2014, which resulted in the acceleration of depreciation and amortization on certain assets.\nInterest expense increased $10.9 million or 24.0%. The increase mainly resulted from our assumption of $859.6 million of debt as part of the Merger with Inland Diversified, in addition to draws on the unsecured revolving credit facility to fund a portion of our 2015 acquisitions. In addition, we secured longer-term fixed rate debt through the issuance of senior unsecured notes that carried higher interest rates than the variable rate on our unsecured revolving credit facility. The increase was also due to certain development projects, including Delray Marketplace and Parkside Town Commons - Phase I becoming operational. As a portion of the project becomes operational, we expense a pro-rata amount of related interest expense.\nWe recorded a non-cash gain on debt extinguishment of $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, related to the retirement of the $90 million loan secured by our City Center operating property.\nWe recorded a gain on settlement of $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, related to the settlement of a dispute related to eminent domain and related damages at one of our operating properties. See additional discussion in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe allocation of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased due to allocations to joint venture partners in certain consolidated properties acquired as part of the Merger with Inland Diversified. These partners are allocated income generally equal to the distribution received from the operations of the properties in which they hold an interest.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur primary finance and capital strategy is to maintain a strong balance sheet with sufficient flexibility to fund our operating and investment activities in a cost-effective manner. We consider a number of factors when evaluating our level of indebtedness and when making decisions regarding additional borrowings or equity offerings, including the estimated value of properties to be developed or acquired, the estimated market value of our properties and the Company as a whole upon placement of the borrowing or offering, and the ability of particular properties to generate cash flow to cover debt service. We will continue to monitor the capital markets and may consider raising additional capital through the issuance of our common or preferred shares, unsecured debt securities, or other securities.\nOur Principal Capital Resources\nFor a discussion of cash generated from operations, see Cash Flows,\u201d beginning on page 74. In addition to cash generated from operations, we discuss below our other principal capital resources.\nThe increased operating cash flows of the Company have substantially enhanced our liquidity position and reduced our borrowing costs. We continue to focus on a balanced approach to growth and staggering debt maturities in order to retain our financial flexibility.\nIn 2016, we drew the remaining $100 million on our $200 million 7-Year Term Loan and used the proceeds to pay down the unsecured revolving credit facility. In addition, we completed a $300 million public offering of 4.00% Senior Notes due October 1, 2026. The net proceeds were utilized to retire both the $200 million Term Loan A and the $75.9 million construction loan secured by our Parkside Town Commons operating property and to fund portions of the retirement of the $25 million loan secured by our Colonial Square and Village Walk operating properties and the $10.4 million loan secured by our Geist Pavilion operating property. We also drew on our unsecured revolving credit facility to fund the retirement of an additional $128.8 million of property level secured debt in 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $409.9 million available under our unsecured revolving credit facility for future borrowings based on the unencumbered asset pool allocated to the unsecured revolving credit facility. We also had $19.9 million in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2016.\nWe were in compliance with all applicable financial covenants under our unsecured revolving credit facility, our unsecured term loans, and our Notes as of December 31, 2016.\nWe have on file with the SEC a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 relating to the offer and sale, from time to time, of an indeterminate amount of equity and debt securities. Equity securities may be offered and sold by the Parent Company, and the net proceeds of any such offerings would be contributed to the Operating Partnership in exchange for additional General Partner Units. Debt securities may be offered and sold by the Operating Partnership with the Operating Partnership receiving the proceeds. From time to time, we may issue securities under this shelf registration statement to fund the repayment of long-term debt upon maturity and for other general corporate purposes.\nWe currently have an at-the-market equity program that allows us to issue new common shares from time to time, with an aggregate offering price of up to $250.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we issued 137,229 common shares at an average price per share of $29.52 pursuant to our at-the-market offering program, generating gross proceeds of approximately $4.1 million and, after deducting commissions and other costs, net proceeds of approximately $3.8 million. We have $245.9 million remaining available for future common share issuances under our current at-the-market equity program.\nIn the future, we will continue to monitor the capital markets and may consider raising additional capital through the issuance of our common shares, preferred shares or other securities. We may also raise capital by disposing of properties, land parcels or other assets that are no longer core components of our growth strategy. The sale price may differ from our carrying value at the time of sale.\nOur Principal Liquidity Needs\nShort-Term Liquidity Needs\nNear-Term Debt Maturities. As of December 31, 2016, we have $6.7 million of debt scheduled to mature in 2017, excluding scheduled monthly principal payments. We have sufficient liquidity to repay this obligation from current resources and our capacity on the unsecured revolving credit facility.\nOther Short-Term Liquidity Needs. The requirements for qualifying as a REIT and for a tax deduction for some or all of the dividends paid to shareholders, necessitate that we distribute at least 90% of our taxable income on an annual basis. Such requirements cause us to have substantial liquidity needs over both the short term and the long term. Our short-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay operating expenses associated with our operating properties, interest expense and scheduled principal payments on our debt, expected dividend payments to our common shareholders and to Common Unit holders, and recurring capital expenditures.\nIn November 2016, our Board of Trustees declared a cash distribution of $0.3025 per common share and Common Unit for the fourth quarter of 2016, which represented a 5.2% increase over our previous quarterly distribution. This distribution was paid on January 13, 2017 to common shareholders and Common Unit holders of record as of January 6, 2017. Future dividends are at the discretion of the Board of Trustees.\nOther short-term liquidity needs include expenditures for tenant improvements, external leasing commissions and recurring capital expenditures. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred $9.3 million of costs for tenant improvements and external leasing commissions (excluding first generation space and development and redevelopment properties) and $1.6 million of costs for recurring capital expenditures on our operating properties We currently anticipate incurring approximately $11 million\nto $13 million of additional major tenant improvements and renovation costs within the next 12 months at a number of our operating properties.\nWe have 10 properties in our 3-R initiative that are currently under construction. Total estimated costs of this construction are expected to be in the range of $58.0 million to $66.5 million and are expected to be incurred through mid-2018. We expect to be able to fund these costs largely from operating cash flow.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had two development projects under construction. The total estimated cost of the development projects is approximately $90.6 million, of which $82.9 million had been incurred as of December 31, 2016. We currently anticipate incurring the remaining $7.7 million of costs over the next 18 months. We believe we currently have sufficient financing in place to fund these projects and expect to do so primarily through borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility.\nLong-Term Liquidity Needs\nOur long-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for any new development projects, redevelopment of existing properties, non-recurring capital expenditures, acquisitions of properties, and payment of indebtedness at maturity.\nPotential Redevelopment, Reposition, Repurpose Opportunities. We are currently evaluating additional redevelopment, repositioning, and repurposing of several other operating properties as part of our 3-R initiative. Total estimated costs of these properties are expected to be in the range of $80 million to $100 million. We believe we will have sufficient funding for these projects through cash flow from operations and borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility.\nSelective Acquisitions, Developments and Joint Ventures. We may selectively pursue the acquisition and development of other properties, which would require additional capital. It is unlikely that we would have sufficient funds on hand to meet these long-term capital requirements. We would have to satisfy these needs through additional borrowings, sales of common or preferred shares, issuance of Operating Partnership units, cash generated through property dispositions or future property acquisitions and/or participation in joint venture arrangements. We cannot be certain that we would have access to these sources of capital on satisfactory terms, if at all, to fund our long-term liquidity requirements. We evaluate all future opportunities against pre-established criteria including, but not limited to, location, demographics, expected return, tenant credit quality, tenant relationships, and amount of existing retail space. Our ability to access the capital markets will be dependent on a number of factors, including general capital market conditions.\nCapitalized Expenditures on Consolidated Properties\nThe following table summarizes cash capital expenditures for our development and redevelopment properties and other capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2016 and on a cumulative basis since the project's inception:\n\n ____________________ 1 This classification includes Holly Springs Towne Center - Phase II, Tamiami Crossing, and Cool Springs Market. \nWe capitalize certain indirect costs such as interest, payroll, and other general and administrative costs related to these development activities. If we were to experience a 10% reduction in development and redevelopment activities, without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs, we would have recorded additional expense of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nImpact of Changes in Credit Ratings on Our Liquidity\nIn 2014, we were assigned investment grade corporate credit ratings from two nationally recognized credit rating agencies. These ratings remain unchanged at December 31, 2016.\nThe ratings could change based upon, among other things, the impact that prevailing economic conditions may have on our results of operations and financial condition. Credit rating reductions by one or more rating agencies could also adversely affect our access to funding sources, the cost and other terms of obtaining funding, as well as our overall financial condition, operating results and cash flow.\nCash Flows\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents on hand of $19.9 million. We may be subject to concentrations of credit risk with regard to our cash and cash equivalents. We place our cash and short-term cash investments with high-credit-quality financial institutions. While we attempt to limit our exposure at any point in time, occasionally, such cash and investments may temporarily be in excess of FDIC and SIPC insurance limits. We also maintain certain compensating balances in several financial institutions in support of borrowings from those institutions. Such compensating balances were not material to the consolidated balance sheets.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2016 to the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nCash provided by operating activities was $154.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $14.4 million from the same period of 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the timing of real estate tax payments and annual insurance payments and an increase in leasing costs.\nCash used in investing activities was $82.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to cash used in investing activities of $84.4 million in the same period of 2015. Highlights of significant cash sources and uses are as follows:\n \u2022 Net proceeds of $14.2 million related to the sale of operating properties in 2016, compared to net proceeds of $170.0 million related to the sale of seven operating properties in March 2015 and the sale of our Four Corner Square and Cornelius Gateway operating properties in December 2015; \n \u2022 There were no property acquisitions in 2016, while there was a net cash outflow of $166.4 million related to acquisitions over the same period in 2015; and \n \u2022 Increase in capital expenditures of $1.8 million, in addition to a decrease in construction payables of $3.0 million. In 2016, we substantially completed construction at our Tamiami Crossing and Holly Springs Towne Center - Phase II development properties, and incurred additional construction costs at several of our redevelopment properties. \nCash used in financing activities was $86.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to cash used in financing activities of $94.9 million in the same period of 2015. Highlights of significant cash sources and uses in 2016 are as follows:\n \u2022 We retired approximately $139 million of secured loans that were secured by multiple operating properties via draws on our unsecured revolving credit facility; \n \u2022 We issued $300 million of our Notes in a public offering. The net proceeds of which were utilized to retire both the $200 million Term Loan A and the $75.9 million construction loan secured by our Parkside Town Commons operating property and to fund a portion of the retirement of $35 million in secured loans. \n \u2022 We drew the remaining $100 million on our $200 million 7-Year Term Loan and used the proceeds to pay down the unsecured revolving credit facility; \n \u2022 We issued 137,229 of our common shares at an average price per share of $29.52 pursuant to our at-the-market equity program, generating gross proceeds of approximately $4.1 million and, after deducting commissions and other costs, net proceeds of approximately $3.8 million. The proceeds from these offerings were contributed to the Operating Partnership and used to pay down our unsecured revolving credit facility; and \n \u2022 We made distributions to common shareholders and Common Unit holders of $98.6 million. \nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2015 to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nCash provided by operating activities was $169.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $126.8 million from the same period of 2014. The increase was primarily due to the increased cash flows generated by the properties acquired in 2014.\nCash used in investing activities was $84.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to cash provided by investing activities of $186.9 million in the same period of 2014. Highlights of significant cash sources and uses are as follows:\n \u2022 Net proceeds of $170.0 million related to the sale of seven operating properties in early 2015 and the sale of Four Corner and Cornelius Gateway operating properties in December 2015 compared to net proceeds of $191.1 million related to the sale of eight operating properties in late 2014 and the sale of Red Bank Commons, Ridge Plaza, and 50th and 12th operating properties in early 2014; \n \u2022 Net cash outflow of $166.4 million related to 2015 acquisitions compared to a net cash outflow of $22.5 million related to the 2014 acquisition of Rampart Commons; and \n \u2022 Decrease in capital expenditures of $2.0 million, in addition to a decrease in the change in construction payables of $19.5 million. In 2015, there was significant construction activity at Parkside Town Commons - Phase II, Tamiami Crossing, and Holly Springs Towne Center - Phase II. \nCash used in financing activities was $94.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to cash used in financing activities of $203.8 million in the same period of 2014. Highlights of significant cash sources and uses in 2015 are as follows:\n \u2022 We drew $102.6 million on the unsecured revolving credit facility to redeem all the outstanding shares of our Series A Preferred Shares; $59 million to fund a portion of the acquisitions of Colleyville Downs, Belle Isle Station, Livingston Shopping Center and Chapel Hill Shopping Center; $30 million to fund the acquisition of our partner's interest in our City Center operating property; and $14.7 million on construction loans related to development projects; \n \u2022 We retired the $12.2 million loan secured by our Indian River operating property, the $26.2 million loan secured by our Plaza Volente operating property and the $50.1 million loan secured by our Landstown Commons operating property; \n \u2022 We exercised the accordion option feature on the existing unsecured term loan to increase our total borrowings from $230 million to $400 million. The $170 million of proceeds were utilized to pay down our unsecured revolving credit facility by $140 million and to retire loans totaling $30.5 million that were secured by our Draper Peaks and Beacon Hill operating properties; \n \u2022 We issued $250 million of senior unsecured notes; \n \u2022 In September 2015, we paid off the remaining balance of $199.6 million on our unsecured revolving credit facility and the $33 million loan secured by our Crossing at Killingly operating property, using proceeds from the issuance of the senior unsecured notes, and then in December 2015, we entered into a new $33 million loan secured by our Crossing at Killingly operating property; \n \u2022 In connection with the sale of seven properties in March 2015, we retired the $24 million loan secured by the Regal Court property. We paid down our unsecured revolving credit facility by $27 million utilizing a portion of proceeds from these property sales. In addition in December 2015, we paid down our unsecured revolving credit facility utilizing gross proceeds of $44.9 million from the sales of Four Corner Square and Cornelius Gateway; \n \u2022 We entered into a 7-Year Term Loan for up to $200 million, and in December 2015 drew $100 million on the 7-Year Term Loan and used the proceeds to pay down the unsecured revolving credit facility that was initially utilized to retire the $90 million loan secured by our City Center operating property. \n \u2022 Distributions to common shareholders and Common Unit holders of $93.1 million; and \n \u2022 Distributions to preferred shareholders of $8.6 million. \nIn addition to the cash activity above, in August 2015, in connection with the acquisition of Chapel Hill Shopping Center, we assumed a $18.3 million loan secured by the operating property. As part of the estimated fair value determination, a debt premium of $0.2 million was recorded.\nOther Matters\nFinancial Instruments\nWe are exposed to capital market risk, such as changes in interest rates. In order to reduce the volatility relating to interest rate risk, we may enter into interest rate hedging arrangements from time to time. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not currently have any off-balance sheet arrangements that in our opinion have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. We do, however, have certain obligations related to some of the projects in our operating and development properties.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we have outstanding letters of credit totaling $10.5 million and no amounts were advanced against these instruments.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations to third parties based on contracts executed as of December 31, 2016.\n\n ____________________ 1 Our long-term debt consists of both variable and fixed-rate debt and includes both principal and interest. Interest expense for variable-rate debt was calculated using the interest rates as of December 31, 2016. 2 Tenant allowances include commitments made to tenants at our operating and under construction development and redevelopment properties. 3 We have entered into employment agreements with certain members of senior management. The term of each employment agreement expires on June 30, 2017, with automatic one-year renewals each July 1st thereafter unless we or the individual elects not to renew the agreement. \nObligations in Connection with Development and Redevelopment Projects Under Construction\nWe are obligated under various completion guarantees with lenders and lease agreements with tenants to complete all or portions of our in-process development and redevelopment projects. We believe we currently have sufficient financing in place to fund our investment in any existing or future projects through cash from operations and borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility.\nOur share of estimated future costs for our under construction and future developments and redevelopments is further discussed on page 73 in the \"Short and Long-Term Liquidity Needs\" section.\nOutstanding Indebtedness\nThe following table presents details of outstanding consolidated indebtedness as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 adjusted for hedges:\n\nConsolidated indebtedness, including weighted average maturities and weighted average interest rates at December 31, 2016, is summarized below:\n\n ____________________ 1 Fixed rate debt includes, and variable rate date excludes, the portion of such debt that has been hedged by interest rate derivatives. As of December 31, 2016, $474.3 million in variable rate debt is hedged for a weighted average 2.7 years. \nMortgage indebtedness is collateralized by certain real estate properties and leases. Mortgage indebtedness is generally repaid in monthly installments of interest and principal and matures over various terms through 2030.\nVariable interest rates on mortgage indebtedness are based on LIBOR plus spreads ranging from 160 to 225 basis points. At December 31, 2016, the one-month LIBOR interest rate was 0.77%. Fixed interest rates on mortgage loans range from 3.78% to 6.78%.", "item_7_tables": "Table 196: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

condition and operational results. Key points from the MD&A include:\n\n- Kite Realty Group Trust is a real estate investment trust specializing in shopping centers across the U.S. It earns mainly from rent and tenant reimbursements.\n- As of December 31, 2016, Kite owned interests in 119 properties including 108 retail properties, 9 retail redevelopment properties, 1 office property, and a parking garage, plus 2 development projects.\n- In 2016, Kite transitioned two development projects to its operating portfolio, started construction on another, and made progress with its 3-R initiative, involving 20 projects aimed at redeveloping existing sites.\n- Kite also focuses on prime sub-markets with strong consumer demographics and an appropriate tenant mix that mitigates the impact of e-commerce expansion.\n- Financing strategies in 2016 included retiring secured loans, amending credit facilities, issuing $300 million of Notes, and reducing term maturities through 2020 to about $90 million with extended weighted-average debt maturities to 6.4 years.\n- Accounting policies involve critical estimates and assumptions that affect reported financial figures, particularly in the valuation of investment properties and revenue recognition.\n- Results of operations for the year are impacted by acquisition, construction, and disposition activities in addition to general economic conditions.\n- FFO (Funds From Operations) and EBITDA are important measures of financial performance used by the company, and it maintained sufficient capital resources and liquidity to cover short-term and long-term needs.\n- Regarding indebtedness, as of 2016, Kite had $1.73 billion in mortgage and other indebtedness, with a weighted average interest rate of 3.96%.\n- Dividend declarations and obligations related to construction projects are also highlighted as significant aspects influencing the company's capital strategy.\n\nOverall, the MD&A provides investors and stakeholders a comprehensive view of Kite Realty Group Trust's financial situation, including the strategies and challenges the company faced during the fiscal year."}
