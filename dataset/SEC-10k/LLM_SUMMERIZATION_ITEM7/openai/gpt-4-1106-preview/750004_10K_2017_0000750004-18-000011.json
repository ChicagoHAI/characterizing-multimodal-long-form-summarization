MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion is intended to enhance the reader's understanding of our operations and current business environment and should be read in conjunction with the description of our business (see Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) and our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes (see Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d ( MD&A\u201d) contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and should be read in conjunction with the disclosures and information contained and referenced under \"Forward-Looking Statements\" and \"Risk Factors\" at the beginning and in Part I, Item 1A, respectively, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As used in this MD&A, the terms \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our\" and the \"Company\" mean Scientific Games Corporation together with its consolidated subsidiaries.\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW\nWe are a leading developer of technology-based products and services and associated content for the worldwide gaming, lottery and interactive gaming industries. Our portfolio includes gaming machines and game content, casino management systems, table game products and services, instant and draw-based lottery games, lottery systems, lottery content and services, interactive gaming and social casino solutions and other products and services. We also gain access to technologies and pursue global expansion through strategic acquisitions and equity investments.\nSGC was incorporated in the state of Delaware on July 2, 1984. On September 18, 2017, SGC entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with SG Nevada Merger Company, a Nevada corporation and SGC's wholly owned subsidiary Newco, providing for the merger of SGC with and into Newco with Newco surviving the merger, for the sole purpose of changing SGC's state of incorporation from Delaware to Nevada.

We are a highly leveraged company which presents several challenges, including the dedication of a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to service interest and principal payments on our indebtedness. Additional challenges we face relate to expanding our footprint within international markets and the related process of obtaining regulatory approvals to provide services and products within these new and emerging markets. A third set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape. Our major competitors are expanding their product and service offerings with integrated products and solutions. We are also faced with challenges related to foreign currency risk. Our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses.\nReportable Segments\nThe segment amounts included in MD&A are presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting as of December 31, 2017. Segment information appearing in Note 2 is also presented on this basis. At the end of fiscal 2017, we had three business segments for financial reporting purposes - Gaming, Lottery and Interactive.\nAs a result of the NYX acquisition (see Note 9) and starting with the first quarter 2018 reporting period, we will report our operations in four business segments, representing our different products and services: Gaming, Lottery, Social and Digital.\nCONSOLIDATED

2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nGaming revenue increased in 2017, primarily due to higher gaming machine sales, placement of table products and hardware sales partially offset by a decrease in WAP and premium game revenue. The gaming revenue increase included the unfavorable impact of $1.6 million from foreign currency.\nLottery revenue increased in 2017, primarily due to higher revenues from our participation and PPU contracts, launching of WILLY WONKA GOLDEN TICKET\u2122 multi-state instant game and higher international terminal and software sales. Lottery increases included the unfavorable foreign currency impact of $1.6 million.\nInteractive revenue increased in 2017, primarily due to 32% growth in our social gaming B2C business reflecting the ongoing popularity of Jackpot Party\u00ae Social Casino and the success of more recent apps, such as the introduction of the 88 Fortunes\u00ae app in the first quarter of 2017, combined with the acquisition of Spicerack, which closed in April 2017, and its Bingo Showdown social gaming app.\nOperating expenses\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs. 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Cost of services(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>417.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>396.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>372.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Cost of product sales(1)\n</td> <td>465.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>424.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>405.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Cost of instant games(1)\n</td> <td>282.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>285.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>325.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(40.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>613.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>577.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>567.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>184.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>204.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>183.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation, amortization and impairments\n</td> <td>682.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>738.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>903.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(55.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(164.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill impairments\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,002.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(69.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(933.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(93\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and other\n</td> <td>45.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>160\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,690.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,752.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,783.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(62.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,030.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Exclusive of D&A.\nCost of revenue\nConsolidated cost of revenue increased by $58.3 million in 2017, including (1) a $40.6 million higher cost of Interactive services primarily related to platform fees associated with the $87.6 million increase in Interactive social revenue; (2) a $11.4 million increase in Lottery cost of product sales driven primarily by increased terminal and software sales; and (3) a $29.3 million increase in Gaming cost of product sales driven by increased gaming machine and hardware sales; partially offset by $20.4 million decrease in gaming cost of services reflecting lower gaming operations revenue and lower third party royalty costs.\nSG&A\nThe increase in SG&A of $36.1 million in 2017 was primarily due to the following: (1) an increase in Interactive SG&A of $25.0 million, primarily driven by additional marketing spend and user acquisition costs related to our growing portfolio of social and mobile gaming apps; (2) a $24.7 million increase in salaries and benefits primarily reflecting higher incentive compensation commensurate with the Company's overall performance and to the lesser extent increased headcount; and (3) a $24.1 million increase in professional and legal fees. This increase was partially offset by benefits realized in the current year from the November 2016 business improvement initiative. The prior year also included $7.5 million of insurance proceeds recorded during the second quarter of 2016 in connection with a settlement of a legal matter.\nR&D\nThe decrease in R&D was primarily driven by reduced spending on outside resources for certain projects and headcount reduction completed as a part of the November 2016 business improvement initiative.\nDepreciation, amortization and impairments\nD&A decreased by $55.9 million in 2017 primarily due to certain acquired intangible assets from the 2013 WMS acquisition and 2014 Bally acquisition becoming fully depreciated in the third quarter of 2016, and acquired Gaming assets for which accelerated depreciation was recorded in the prior comparable period.\nGoodwill impairments\nDuring 2016, we recorded an impairment charge of $69.0 million to reduce the carrying value of our International Lottery Systems reporting unit's goodwill balance to its implied fair value. See Note 11 for additional information.\nRestructuring and other\nRestructuring and other costs decreased $11.1 million in 2017, primarily associated with costs incurred in 2016 related to the November 2016 business improvement initiative partially offset by acquisition-related costs associated with NYX acquisition. See Note 4 for additional information.\nOther Factors Affecting 2017, 2016 and 2015 Net Loss Comparability Table 106: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Factors Affecting Net Loss\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs. 2016\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(609.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(661.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(664.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Lower cash interest costs primarily resulting from 2017 refinancing transactions (further discussed in Liquidity, Capital Resources and Working Capital\u201d).\n</td> <td>No significant changes compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Loss) gain on debt financing transactions\n</td> <td>(38.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Loss on debt financing transactions from our refinancing transactions consummated during the year (further discussed in Liquidity, Capital Resources and Working Capital\u201d).\n</td> <td>Gain on debt financing transactions from our repurchase and cancellation of $65.9 million in principal debt balance of our 2020 Notes and 2021 Notes.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 results reflect $8.4 million loss compared to a $2.2 million gain in 2016, primarily due to the strengthening of the British Pound Sterling and the Euro, driving a $10.6 million change. 2017 also includes $1.5 million loss related to change in fair value of NYX investment (see Note 13).\n</td> <td>2016 results reflect a $2.2 million gain compared to a $28.9 million loss in 2015, primarily due to the weakening of the British Pound Sterling and the Euro, driving a $31.1 million change.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax (expense) benefit(1)\n</td> <td>(14.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>125.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>299.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>The change in income tax expense from 2016 to 2017 is primarily due to the Company no longer benefiting its U.S. losses in 2017 as a result of having a full valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets.

The gaming revenue decrease included the negative impact of $22.4 million from foreign currency.\nLottery revenue increased in 2016 primarily due to higher U.S revenue, mostly driven by an increase in U.S. instant game sales revenue with particular strength in Participation contracts and from CSP customers for whom we provide our integrated CSP offerings and increased retail sales of multi-state games including sales leading up to the record $1.6 billion POWERBALL jackpot in January 2016. These increases were offset by an unfavorable $21.7 million impact from the expiration of the CSL validation contract in January 2016 and a negative $9.1 million impact from foreign currency.\nInteractive revenue increased in 2016 primarily due to 60.8% growth in our social gaming B2C business reflecting the ongoing popularity of Jackpot Party Social Casino and the success of our recently launched Quick Hit\u00ae Slots, Hot Shot Casino\u00ae and Blazing 7s Slots\u2122 social gaming apps.\nCost of revenue\nConsolidated cost of revenue increased by $2.2 million in 2016, including (1) a $26.7 million increase in cost of unit shipments in Gaming resulting from the introduction of the TwinStar\u00ae Dual-Screen and TwinStar J43\u2122 Video gaming machines which generally carry higher costs at launch and trend lower as they mature; (2) a $48.9 million increase in the cost of Interactive services primarily related to volume-driven increase in the third-party platform fees on the $122.8 million increase in Interactive revenues, which was offset by; (3) a decrease of $25.1 million in gaming costs primarily associated with placement of WAP, premium and other leased machines as operators have removed more of these machines from their gaming floors; (4) an $11.0 million decrease in costs related to systems and hardware sales; and (5) a $40.7 million reduction in cost of instant games primarily due to the cancellation of the MONOPOLYTM MILLIONAIRES' CLUB (MMC) game.\nSG&A\nThe increase in SG&A of $9.3 million in 2016 was primarily due to the following: (1) a $34.9 million increase in marketing primarily driven by Interactive marketing and player acquisition costs related to new games launched in 2016 and the increased marketing related to our Jackpot Party Social Casino app; (2) a $9.9 million increase in stock-based compensation, primarily attributable to the accelerated recognition of certain stock based compensation, which was offset by; (3) a $15.4 million decrease in salaries and benefits resulting from headcount actions; and (4) a $21.2 million decrease in professional and legal fees, which includes a $7.5 million credit related to insurance proceeds received during the second quarter of 2016 in connection with the settlement of a legal matter.\nR&D\nR&D increased by $20.9 million in 2016, primarily driven by higher investments in new product and app development across each of our business segments.\nDepreciation, amortization and impairments\nD&A decreased by $164.5 million in 2016 and was primarily due to the following: (1) the non-recurrence of $128.6 million of intangible asset impairment charges recognized in 2015 which reduced the carrying value of two trade name assets to their fair value; (2) the impact from the expiration of the CSL validation contract in January 2016; and (3) an $11.9 million impairment of the MMC game studio recognized in 2015 which did not recur in 2016.\nGoodwill impairments\nDuring 2016, we recorded an impairment charge of $69.0 million to reduce the carrying value of our International Lottery Systems reporting unit's goodwill balance to its implied fair value. During 2015, we recorded an aggregate goodwill impairment charges of $1,002.6 million to reduce the carrying value of our SG Gaming and U.S. Lottery Systems reporting units' goodwill balances to their implied fair value. See Note 11 for additional information.\nRestructuring and other\nRestructuring and other costs increased $35.1 million in 2016 primarily associated with the business improvement initiative which was announced on November 3, 2016. See Note 4 for additional information.\nBUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS\nThe types of products and services from which our segments derive their revenues are further discussed in Notes 2 and 3. Certain financial information relating to our segments, including segment revenue, operating income (loss) and total assets for the last three fiscal years and certain financial information relating to our revenue derived from and assets located in the U.S. and other geographic areas is included in Note 2.\nGAMING\nOur Gaming business segment designs, develops, manufactures, markets and distributes a comprehensive portfolio of gaming products and services. We provide our Gaming portfolio of products and services to commercial casinos, Native American casinos, wide-area gaming operators such as LBOs, arcade and bingo operators in the U.K. and continental Europe, and government agencies and their affiliated operators. Our equity investments in RCN and International Terminal Leasing are part of our Gaming business segment.\nThe following table summarizes the primary business activities included in our Gaming business segment.\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Product sales\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gaming operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Service revenues from gaming operations are derived from WAP, premium and daily-fee Participation gaming machines and other leased gaming machines (including VLTs and electronic table games) and other services revenue from leasing game themes or other licensing arrangements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gaming machine sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Sale of new and used gaming machines, ETSs and VLTs, conversion game kits and spare parts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gaming systems\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>We provide services which include installation and support of casino management systems, including ongoing hardware maintenance and software upgrade services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>We offer core slot, casino and table-management systems (collectively, \"casino-management systems\") that help our customers improve communication with players, add excitement to the gaming floor and enhance operating efficiencies.

We categorize our Participation gaming machines as (1) WAP, premium and daily fee Participation games and (2) other leased and Participation games.\nWAP, premium and daily fee Participation games\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>WAP Participation games: WAP Participation games are electronically linked gaming machines that are located across multiple casinos within a single gaming jurisdiction or across Native American gaming jurisdictions. Players across linked gaming machines contribute to and compete for system-wide progressive jackpots that are designed to increase gaming machine play for participating casinos by giving the players the opportunity to win a larger jackpot than on a non-WAP gaming machine. We are responsible for funding WAP jackpots. We create WAP games using our proprietary brands and also using licensed brands. We operate our WAP systems in six states throughout the U.S. and in certain Native American casinos.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Premium and daily fee Participation games: We offer two categories of non-WAP premium and daily fee Participation games: LAP and standalone. LAP games are gaming machines that are located within a single casino and are electronically linked to a progressive jackpot for that specific casino. Our LAP gaming machines feature games including those offered as WAP and our proprietary brands such as Jackpot Party Progressive\u00ae, Life of Luxury\u00ae Progressive, 88 Fortunes, 5 Treasures\u00ae, and Cash Spin. Our LAP products leverage both exclusive brand names and game play intellectual property, and typically offer players the chance to win multiple progressive jackpots, all of which tend to result in higher play volumes. We also provide certain standalone Participation games that are not linked to other gaming machines. Our standalone games feature titles under licensed brands and our\nproprietary brands. Our standalone Participation gaming machines generally feature larger, more elaborate top-boxes and provide game play experiences not possible on a single screen game or on gaming machines that we sell.\nOther leased and Participation games\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Server-based gaming: We provide wide-area gaming operators, such as LBOs, bingo halls and arcades, a comprehensive package of server-based products and services under long term contracts that typically include gaming machines, remote management of game content and management information, central computer systems, secure data communication and field support services. We are typically paid a fee based on the Net win generated by these gaming machines (subject to certain adjustments as may be specified in a particular contract, including adjustments for taxes and other fees). Our business in this category is primarily based in the U.K.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>VLTs: For certain customers, we provide our multi-game and single-game VLTs, which include video gaming machines, mechanical reel gaming machines and video poker games. Our VLTs may be operated as standalone units or may interface with central monitoring systems operated by government agencies. Our VLTs are typically located in places where casino-style gaming is not the only attraction, such as racetracks, bars and restaurants.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Class II and centrally determined systems: We offer video and mechanical-reel gaming machines and VLTs for Class II and certain VLT jurisdictions where the game outcome is determined by a central server system that we provide. These Class II and centrally determined systems primarily operate in Native American casinos in Washington, Florida, Alabama and Oklahoma. We receive either a fixed daily fee or a percentage of the Net win generated by the gaming machines or VLTs connected to the central determination system and a small daily fee for the central determination system.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Gaming Machine Sales\nThe majority of our product sales are derived from sales of gaming machines and VLTs that use a combination of advanced graphics, mechanical reels, digital music and sounds and secondary bonus games. We also sell ETSs to either meet the needs of particular locations where live tables are not allowed or as productivity-enhancing solutions for other jurisdictions.\nGaming Systems\nOur comprehensive suite of technology solutions provides gaming operations of every size with a wide range of marketing, data management and analysis, accounting, player tracking, security and other applications and tools to more effectively manage their operations. Gaming systems products include the iVIEW\u00ae touch screen display, which facilitates the player experience, bonus features, customer service, and employee functions. Gaming systems revenues related to core system solutions are highly dependent on new installations. Gaming system revenues are also generated through ongoing hardware and software maintenance services and upgrades.\nTable Products\nOur table product sales are generated primarily from the sale of products designed to enhance table game speed, productivity, profitability and security. Our product offerings include various models of Shufflers to suit specific games.\nWe offer Shuffler products under month-to-month arrangements that contain Participation rates or fixed monthly rates. These arrangements include service of the product with back-up and replacement products available at the customer's request.\nWe license our PTG content to commercial, tribal and governmental casino operators typically under month to month arrangements based on fixed monthly rates. PTGs which are designed to enhance operators' table-game operations, include our internally developed and acquired PTGs, side bets, add-ons and progressive features. Our proprietary content and features are also added to public domain games such as poker, baccarat, pai gow poker, craps and blackjack table games and to electronic platforms.\nRevenues from our Gaming products and services to external customers accounted for 60%, 61% and 64% of our total revenues in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nCurrent year update\nDespite strong gaming machine sales during 2017, we believe the market for gaming machine sales was challenging during 2017 and could remain challenging in the near term. These challenges included: (1) restrained investment in new replacement gaming machines by our existing customers; (2) increased competition for new systems, gaming operations, gaming machines and table products businesses; and (3) other economic and regulatory pressures that affect our business operations globally.\nFor 2018, we expect to continue to face pricing pressure in our Gaming segment. We anticipate that replacement demand for gaming machines and constraints on capital spending by gaming operators will continue at current levels. We anticipate that demand for our gaming systems products and services could increase due to several Canadian contracts and related new system implementations during 2018; however, timing can fluctuate based on actual installations of the solutions. We believe we have begun to stabilize the erosion in the installed base of WAP, premium and daily-fee Participation gaming machines. In 2017, we demonstrated a significant breadth and depth of innovative new products that we expect to launch in the year ahead to support our target of growing the overall category. These products were headlined by three JAMES BOND themed games showcased on our new Gamefield 2.0TM and TwinStar J43 iReels cabinets.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, our contracts with two of the large U.K. bookmakers represented a significant portion of our U.K. LBO server-based gaming business. Our current contract with Ladbrokes plc ( Ladbrokes\u201d) commenced on October 22, 2013 and is scheduled to expire on March 31, 2019. Our current contract with Gala Coral Group Ltd. ( Gala Coral\u201d) commenced on January 1, 2010 and expired on December 31, 2017, with the parties continuing to operating under the current contract terms and conditions, until ongoing negotiations (described below) are concluded. In October 2016, Ladbrokes and Gala Coral merged. We are currently in negotiation with LadbrokesCoral Group about a new contract for the merged entity, with negotiation expected to be completed in 2018.\nResults of Operations and Key Performance

Operations\nGaming operations revenue decreased in 2017 in part due to: (1) a 823 unit decrease in the installed base of WAP, premium and daily-fee Participation gaming machines; (2) a decrease in the average daily revenue per WAP, premium and daily-fee Participation units primarily reflecting a lower mix of high-yielding WAP games; and (3) a decrease in the average daily revenue per Other Participation and leased units, which was partially offset by a 785 unit increase in installed base of other participation and leased units.\nGaming Machine Sales\nGaming machine unit sales increased due to higher unit shipments primarily resulting from sales and strong performance of the TwinStar family of gaming machines, along with continued strong sales of the Pro Wave\u00ae cabinet.\nU.S. and Canadian shipments encompassed 15,015 replacement units, including 250 Oregon VLT units (which completed the contract), and 5,466 units for new casino openings and expansions, including 2,469 Illinois VGT units. International shipments encompassed 12,308 replacement units and 949 units for new casino openings and expansions. The average sales price increased to $17,231 per unit reflecting a greater mix of higher-priced premium gaming machines sold during the period.\nGaming Systems\nGaming systems sales increased in 2017 due to increased hardware sales, driven by placements of the iView 4 hardware products, with significant sales to Tribal gaming customers, coupled with the new gaming system implementations in the province of Alberta.\nTable Products\nTable products revenue increased in 2017 primarily due to increased Shuffler sales, table product placements and the impact of the acquisition of DEQ Systems Corp., which closed in January 2017.\nOperating income\nThe increase in operating income in 2017 was primarily attributable to the following: (1) higher overall gaming revenues as described above; (2) a decrease in overall operating expenses primarily due to the November 2016 business improvement initiative; (3) lower D&A of $64.4 million for the period due to certain acquired intangible assets becoming fully amortized in the third quarter of 2016, and acquired Gaming assets for which accelerated depreciation was recorded in the prior comparable period; and (4) a more profitable revenue mix, which was primarily due to an increase in Gaming systems sales.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nGaming Operations\nGaming operations revenue decreased in 2016 in part due to: (1) a 787 unit decrease in the installed base of WAP, premium and daily-fee Participation gaming machines; (2) a decrease in the average daily revenue per WAP, premium and daily-fee Participation units primarily reflecting a lower mix of high-yielding WAP games; (3) a 475 unit decrease in the ending installed base for Other Participation and leased units; and (4) a decrease in the average daily revenue per Other Participation and leased units. As a result of the third quarter release of our GameScape\u2122 cabinet, our WAP installed base at the end of the fourth quarter of 2016 was up approximately 1% on a sequential quarter basis.\nGaming Machine Sales\nGaming machine unit sales increased due to higher global unit shipments primarily resulting from sales of the Pro Series WAVE (released in 2014), and the TwinStar and Dualos cabinets, both released in 2015.\nU.S. and Canadian shipments encompassed 13,969 replacement units, including 1,271 Oregon VLT units (which completed the shipment under the related contract), and 4,211 units for new casino openings and expansions, including 1,700 Illinois VGT units. International shipments encompassed 11,956 replacement units and 1,474 units for new casino openings and expansions. The average sales price increased to $16,647 per unit, reflecting a greater mix of higher-performing premium gaming machines sold during the period.\nGaming Systems\nGaming systems sales decreased in 2016 due to lower hardware, software and services sales resulting from fewer large, multi-site opportunities, system replacements and new casino openings in 2016. The decreases were partially offset by a 5% increase in systems maintenance revenue.\nTable Products\nTable products revenue increased due to increased Shuffler sales driven by sales into Asian markets and a 5% increase in revenue from leased Shufflers, PTGs and progressives primarily due to the success of the Blazing 7s BlackjackTM Progressive.\nOperating income\nThe increase in operating income was primarily attributable to the following: (1) the non-recurrence of a 2015 goodwill impairment charge; (2) a decrease in overall operating expenses primarily due to realized integration cost synergies largely implemented in prior periods, including lower SG&A expense of $37.1 million for the year which benefited from $7.5 million of insurance proceeds received in connection with the settlement of a legal matter; and (3) lower D&A expense of $143.3 million, driven by the non-recurrence of 2015 intangible asset impairments which totaled $128.6 million; partially offset by (4) a less profitable revenue mix, which was due to an increase in lower-margin Gaming machine sales revenue and a decline in higher-margin Gaming systems and Gaming operations revenue.\nLOTTERY\nThe Lottery segment is primarily comprised of our systems-based services and product sales business and our instant games business. Our systems-based services and product sales business provides customized computer software, software support, equipment and data communication services, sports wagering systems and keno to lotteries. In the U.S., we typically provide the\nnecessary POS terminals and equipment, software and maintenance services on a Participation basis under long-term contracts that typically have an initial term of at least five years. Internationally, we typically sell POS terminals and/or computer software to lottery authorities and may provide ongoing fee-based systems maintenance and software support services.\nOur instant games business generates revenue from the manufacture and sale of instant games, and the provision of value-added services such as game design, sales and marketing support, specialty games and promotions, inventory management, warehousing, fulfillment services, and full instant game category management. In addition, we provide licensed games, promotional entertainment and internet-based marketing services to the lottery industry. These revenues are presented as instant games revenue.\nOur equity investments in LNS, Northstar Illinois, Northstar New Jersey, CSG, Hellenic Lotteries and GLB are included in the Lottery segment.\nThe following table summarizes the primary business activities included in the Lottery business segment.\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Product Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Instant Games\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Instant products - Participation and PPU(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Designing, printing and selling instant lottery games\nProviding instant game-related services, such as game design, sales and marketing support and inventory management\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Instant products - licensing and player loyalty\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Supplying player loyalty programs, merchandising services and interactive marketing campaigns\nSublicensing brands for lottery products and providing lottery-related promotional products\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lottery systems - services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Providing software, hardware and related services for lottery operations: including draw systems, instant ticket validation systems, sports wagering and keno systems\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Providing lottery systems hardware to customers where we have an ongoing services arrangement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lottery systems - sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Lottery systems software maintenance and support\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Providing lottery systems, including hardware, software, and instant game validation systems\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) See Instant Lottery Games below.\nInstant Lottery Games\nWe generate revenue from the sale of instant lottery games. Some of our contracts bundle the design and manufacturing of instant lottery games, instant game management systems and marketing and other services, such as the design and installation of game management software, inventory and distribution, sales, accounting, training and advisory services, market research and retailer training and recruitment. We are typically paid on a Participation basis under these contracts. We believe these services help lotteries effectively manage and support their operations, achieve higher retail sales and lower operating costs. We also provide licensed games and promotional and interactive marketing services to the lottery industry.\nWe market instant lottery games and related services to U.S. and international lotteries and commercial customers. We supply instant lottery games to 39 of the 44 U.S. jurisdictions that sell instant lottery games and have sold instant lottery games to customers in approximately 50 countries. Our U.S. instant lottery game contracts customarily have an initial term of three to five years and frequently include multiple renewal options for additional periods ranging from one to five years, which our customers have generally exercised in the past. We usually sell our instant lottery games on a PPU (meaning instant games sold to customer at a fixed price per unit) or Participation basis. Certain of our international customers purchase instant lottery games as needed rather than under multi-game supply contracts.\nWe provide lotteries with access to some of the world's most popular entertainment brands on lottery products, which we believe helps increase our customers' instant game sales. Our licensed entertainment brands include AMC\u00ae THE WALKING DEAD\u00ae, HARLEY-DAVIDSON\u00ae, LOTERIATM, MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL\u00ae, MARGARITAVILLE\u00ae, MONOPOLY, NATIONAL BASKETBALL ASSOCIATION, THE PRICE IS RIGHT\u00ae and SLINGO\u00ae. We also provide branded merchandise, advertising, promotional support, drawing management services and prize fulfillment programs. In addition, we offer lotteries interactive\nmarketing services through our Loyalty Plus program which features players clubs, reward programs, second chance promotional websites, interactive games and subscription systems that enable players to purchase lottery games securely over the internet.\nLottery Systems\nWe are a leading provider of lottery systems including customized computer software, software support, equipment, and data communication services, to lotteries world-wide. Our U.S. arrangements ordinarily include the following: (1) provision of the necessary equipment (including POS terminals) and (2) software and maintenance services pursuant to long-term contracts that typically have an initial term of at least five years under which we are generally paid a fee equal to a percentage of the lottery's total retail sales. Our U.S. contracts commonly include multiple renewal options that generally have been exercised by our customers in the past. Internationally, we primarily sell: (1) POS terminals and/or computer software and hardware to lottery authorities; and (2) provide ongoing fee-based systems and software support services.\nOur lottery systems use proprietary technology that facilitates high-speed processing of draw lottery game wagers and validation of winning draw and instant lottery games. This business includes the supply of proprietary transaction-processing software, draw lottery games, keno, point-of-sale terminals, central site computers and communication platforms and ongoing operational support and maintenance services. We have contracts to operate lottery systems for 10 of the 46 U.S. jurisdictions that operate draw lotteries. Internationally, we have lottery systems operating in 14 countries including Canada and China.\nThe fees we earn under our lottery systems contracts are generally included in our services revenue. Revenue from the sale of our POS terminals and/or computer software is included in our product sales revenue, while the fees we generate from ongoing systems and software support are generally included in our services revenue.\nWe have equity investments in LNS, Northstar New Jersey, Hellenic Lotteries, CSG and GLB, which entities operate or assist in the operation of lotteries. We are also the primary provider of instant lottery games to LNS and Northstar New Jersey and the exclusive provider of instant lottery games to Camelot Illinois, LLC and Hellenic Lotteries. Additional information regarding these equity investments is included in Note 13.\nRevenues from our Lottery products and services to external customers accounted for 26%, 27% and 28% of our total revenues in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nCurrent year update\nWe believe we will continue to face intense price-based competition in our Lottery business in 2018. In the near term, we also expect to see an increase in the number of jurisdictions that seek to privatize or outsource lottery operations and to face strong competition from both traditional and new competitors with respect to these opportunities. In addition, we anticipate that lottery RFPs, specifically those for PMA arrangements and certain of our international customers, could increasingly include terms that expose us to increased risk, such as requiring the guarantee of specific income thresholds or significant upfront payments. Also, the renewal of the LNS concession for up to nine years will result in the continuation of our instant lottery games supply agreement for the term of the renewal, under which we are the primary provider of instant lottery games to LNS.\nResults of Operations and Key Performance Indicators\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

include only sales of instant games.\n(3) U.S. lottery systems customers' retail sales primarily include sales of draw games, keno and instant games validated by the relevant system.\n(4) Retail sales may not have a direct correlation to our revenue due to terms of our contracts, the impact of changes in our contracts or other factors.\nPrimary factors affecting total higher Lottery revenue in 2017 were: (1) a $14.3 million increase in instant product revenues driven by higher revenues in Participation and PPU contracts coupled with launching of WILLY WONKA GOLDEN TICKET\u2122 multi-state instant licensed game; and (2) a $19.3 million increase in lottery systems revenues for the period driven by higher domestic and international terminal and software sales. Lottery revenues included unfavorable foreign currency impact on revenue (primarily in the U.K.) totaling $1.6 million for year ended December 31, 2017.\nOperating income\nOperating income increased in 2017 primarily due to a more profitable revenue mix and the following key factors: (1) a decrease in D&A totaling $16.4 million driven by certain Lottery systems equipment becoming fully depreciated during 2016 and write-off of equipment associated with a cancelled contract in 2016; and (2) a decrease in SG&A of $6.3 million primarily due to the November 2016 business improvement initiative. The year ended December 31, 2016 also included a $69.0 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge.\nEarnings from equity investments\nThe increase in earnings from equity investments of $13.7 million was primarily due to an $11.3 million impairment charge recorded during the year ended December 31, 2016 related to an equity investment in China.\nAs a result of the LNS concession renewal described above and in Note 13, LNS is required to pay \u20ac800 million in upfront fees. The upfront fees will be amortized by LNS (anticipated to be approximately \u20ac89 million each year on a pre-tax basis and commencing in September 2019), which will reduce our equity in earnings of LNS. Our share of the amortization expense is expected to be approximately \u20ac18 million each year on a pre-tax basis.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nRevenue\nPrimary factors affecting the slight increase in total Lottery revenue in 2016 were: (1) continued strength in Participation and PPU contracts (especially with customers having a CSP contract) which increased instant games revenue by $27.4 million; and (2) U.S. revenue from retail sales of multi-state games which increased total revenue by $6.6 million, which were partially offset by; (3) the expiration of the CSL validation contract which had a negative $21.7 million impact on services revenue; (4) an\nunfavorable impact on revenue from foreign currency (primarily in the U.K.) totaling $9.1 million; and (5) a decrease of $2.7 million in other product sales revenues.\nOperating income\nOperating income increased primarily due to: (1) a more profitable revenue mix and the non-recurrence of a $35.5 million charge related to other asset impairments and certain cancellation costs of MMC included in cost of instant games sales in 2015, which reduced cost of sales by $42.0 million; and (2) a decrease in D&A totaling $29.5 million. The decreases in cost of sales and D&A are primarily attributable to the cancellation of the MONOPOLY MILLIONAIRES' CLUB TV game show in 2015.\nEarnings from equity investments\nThe decrease in earnings from equity investments of $5.1 million was primarily due to an $11.3 million impairment charge recorded during the year ended December 31, 2016 related to an equity investment in China.\nINTERACTIVE\nThe following table summarizes the primary business activities included in the Interactive business segment as of December 31, 2017.\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Services\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Social\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Operating social casino-style, slot-based games and bingo-based games through Facebook, iOS, Android and various other desktop and mobile platforms\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> RMG\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Provision of content, via remote game server technology, to licensed online casino operators on both desktop and mobile platforms\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> SG Universe\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Provision of play-for-fun and play-for-free white-label gaming for traditional land-based casinos through SG Universe\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSocial Gaming\nIn our social gaming business, we generate revenue from the sale of virtual coins, chips or bingo cards, which players can use to play slot, table games or bingo games (i.e., spin in the case of slot games, bet in the case of table games and use of bingo cards in the case of bingo games). The games are primarily our WMS, Bally, Barcrest, SHFL, Dragonplay\u00ae and recently acquired Bingo Showdown branded games. In addition, we also offer third-party branded games and original content.\nOur apps include Jackpot Party Social Casino, Gold Fish\u00ae Casino Slots, Quick Hit Slots and Hot Shot Casino, Dragonplay Slots\u00ae, Dragonplay Poker\u00ae, Blazing 7s Slots and Bingo Showdown on various platforms which include: Facebook, Apple, Google Play, Amazon Kindle, Yahoo (through March 2016) and Microsoft Windows.\nRMG\nIn our RMG business, we provide game content to real-money online casino operators, primarily in Europe. We host the play of our game content on our centrally-located servers (often referred to as remote game servers) that are integrated with the online casino operators' websites and mobile applications. We typically earn a percentage of the operator's net gaming revenue generated by the games we host.\nSG Universe\nSG Universe includes Play4Fun NetworkTM interactive services for land based casino operators under which we provide our customers the ability to customize marketing to players while giving players access to their loyalty reward credits and the ability to make on-property reservations. We host play-for-fun and play-for-free services for traditional land-based casinos and earn revenue based on fixed fees, a share of the proceeds from the sale of virtual coins, or a mix of fixed fees and a share of such proceeds. We provide a social casino platform delivered through a land based casino operator's branded website and mobile application.\nWe believe that growth in our Interactive business is driven largely through new channels of distribution, such as the various types of mobile gaming platforms, the expansion of legal interactive RMG jurisdictions, the addition of social gaming products, the number and quality of our proprietary and third-party branded games released and available to players, the addition of\ntraditional land-based casino operators and RMG operators that are not currently customers, the effectiveness of our marketing efforts designed to engage new players and re-engage existing players, and the prominence of our offerings on operators' websites, which we do not control.\nRevenues from our Interactive services to external customers accounted for 14%, 12% and 8% of our total revenues in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nAs described in Note 13, during the fourth quarter of 2017, we acquired a non-controlling interest in NYX, which is a leading digital gaming software supplier for interactive, social and mobile gaming worldwide. On January 5, 2018, we successfully completed the NYX acquisition.\nCurrent year update\nWe continue to pursue our multi-product strategy in our social gaming B2C business and, late in the first quarter of 2017, we launched 88 Fortunes Slots on mobile worldwide.\nOn April 7, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Spicerack, a privately held mobile and social game company, which has allowed us to incorporate the successful Bingo Showdown game into our portfolio.\nOn July 7, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Red7, a privately held U.K.-based mobile and interactive casino content developer, which expands our existing portfolio of mobile and interactive game titles.\nResults of Operations and Key Performance Indicators\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td>

As stated in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe that the estimates, assumptions, and judgments involved in the following accounting policies have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements:\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles, long lived assets and finite lived intangible assets- impairment assessment;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Allowance for doubtful accounts - Notes receivable;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Income taxes; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Legal contingencies.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements\nSome of our arrangements include multiple elements. As a result, significant contract interpretation may be required to determine the appropriate accounting, including the identification of deliverables considered to be separate units of accounting, the allocation of the transaction price among elements in the arrangement and the timing of revenue recognition for each of those elements.\nWe recognize revenue for delivered elements as separate units of accounting when the delivered elements have standalone value to the customer. For elements with no standalone value, we recognize revenue consistent with the pattern of\nthe delivery of the final deliverable. In arrangements with combined units of accounting, changes in the allocation of the transaction price among elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition for the contract but will not change the total revenue recognized for the contract.\nWe establish the selling prices used for each non-software deliverable based on vendor specific objective evidence ( VSOE\u201d) of selling price, if available, third-party evidence ( TPE\u201d), if VSOE of selling price is not available, or estimated selling price ( ESP\u201d), if neither VSOE of selling price nor TPE is available. We establish VSOE of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and, in rare instances, using the price established by management having the relevant authority. We evaluate TPE of selling price by reviewing largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers. ESP is established based on management's judgment considering internal factors such as margin objectives, pricing practices, customer segment pricing strategies and the product life cycle. Consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and industry technology life cycles. In most arrangements with multiple elements, the transaction price is allocated to the individual units of accounting at inception of the arrangement based on their relative selling price.\nFor software elements, we follow the industry specific software guidance which only allows for the use of VSOE in establishing fair value. Generally, VSOE of fair value is the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately or the price established by management for a product that is not yet sold. ESPs are established as best estimates of what the selling prices would be if the deliverables were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The ESP for software elements is based on the criteria explained in the preceding paragraph. We are required to use judgment and consider multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. If we were to change any of these judgments or estimates, it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period. Amounts for fees collected or invoiced and due relating to arrangements where revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized when the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied.\nGoodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units on at least an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) annually (October 1) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.\nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment, if any, for each reporting unit. This is especially true for reporting units where goodwill has been partially impaired as a result of recent impairment assessments, and accordingly, is at risk of additional partial or total impairment should we experience relatively minor adverse changes in our significant assumptions. Recent goodwill impairments (see Note 11) are as follows:\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reporting Unit\n</td> <td>Year\n</td> <td>Impairment charge\n</td> <td>Tax benefit\n</td> <td>Goodwill (at December 31, 2017)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International Lottery Systems\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>$69.0\n</td> <td>$14.5\n</td> <td>$23.5\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SG Gaming\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>$935.0\n</td> <td>None\n</td> <td>$1,094.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Lottery Systems\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>$67.6\n</td> <td>$24.9\n</td> <td>$-\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther than the reporting units with recent partial impairments noted in the table above, we have no other reporting units where we currently believe significant risk of impairment exists. Our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2017, resulted in cushion of 35% and 78% for International Lottery Systems and SG Gaming reporting units, respectively, for which we recorded impairment charges during years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (as disclosed in the table above).\nA substantial portion of our legacy U.K. Gaming reporting unit revenue is concentrated with LadbrokesCoral Group, which operates LBOs in the U.K. In October 2017, the U.K. government published its consultation on the review of stakes and prizes for all gaming terminals in the U.K. gaming sector. The consultation recommends a reduction in stakes on certain\ngaming machines. Although the consultation period closed in January 2018, any decision by the U.K. government was not enacted into law as of our goodwill impairment testing date nor as of December 31, 2017, and accordingly was not taken into consideration for related projections. The ultimate impact of a change in the allowed stakes on U.K. gaming machines was not determinable as of our goodwill impairment testing date.\nOur annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2017, which was based on laws and regulations enacted as of the testing date and objective factors including normalized historical results, resulted in a cushion of 85% for our legacy U.K. Gaming reporting unit. Although the estimated fair value of our legacy U.K. Gaming reporting unit was in excess of its respective carrying values, any enacted regulatory changes resulting in a significant reduction to allowable stakes could negatively impact our customers and our U.K. gaming business and could potentially result in an impairment of goodwill. As of December 31, 2017, our legacy U.K Gaming reporting unit carrying amount of goodwill was $184.8 million.\nGoodwill is reviewed for impairment using either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative one-step process (following our adoption of ASU 2016-18 in the first quarter of 2017). If we perform a qualitative assessment and determine that the fair value of a reporting unit more likely than not exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is necessary. For reporting units where we perform the quantitative process, we are required to compare the fair value of each reporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows, and a market approach to the respective carrying value, which includes goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying value is higher than the fair value, we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit's estimated fair value.\nDiscounted cash flow analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, the relative risk of achieving those cash flows, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. When using the market approach, we make judgments about the comparability of publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses or public transactions information for similar businesses. We base our judgments on factors such as size, growth rates, profitability, risk, and return on investment. We also make judgments when adjusting market multiples of revenue, and earnings for these companies to reflect their relative similarity to our business. Our analysis also includes comparison of our reporting units' total estimated fair values to the total enterprise value and assessing the implied control premium, supporting the reasonableness of our concluded estimated fair values determined under the combination of income and market approaches as of our testing date. Refer to Note 11 for key estimates and assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis for SG Gaming, U.S. Lottery Systems and International Lottery Systems reporting units in periods during which our impairment testing for these reporting units resulted in an impairment charge.\nWe test our indefinite-lived assets annually for impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived asset is less than its carrying value or when circumstances no longer continue to support an indefinite useful life. An impairment test may be qualitative or quantitative, depending on the circumstances. When a quantitative test is performed, a fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow approach where projections of future cash flows generated by those assets are discounted using an estimated discount rate. We estimate the fair value of our indefinite-lived assets using the relief-from-royalty method, which uses several significant assumptions, including an assumed royalty rate, revenue projections that consider both historical and estimated future results, general economic and market conditions, and the impact of planned business and operational strategies. If the indicated fair value of the indefinite-lived asset exceeds its carrying value, the asset is not considered impaired. In the event that the fair value of the indefinite-lived asset is less than its carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment charge.\nLong-lived assets and finite lived intangible assets\nWe evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets and other long-lived assets with finite useful lives by comparing the carrying value of the asset group to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows that we expect the asset to generate if events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets are not recoverable. Any impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value. The fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow approach where projections of future cash flows generated by those assets are discounted using an estimated discount rate. Significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows. We also make judgments about the remaining useful lives of intangible assets and other long-lived assets that have finite lives. While we believe our estimates of future operating results and projected cash flows are reasonable, any significant adverse changes in key assumptions (i.e., adverse change in the extent or manner which an asset (asset group) is being used or expectation that, more likely than not, an asset (asset group) will be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of its useful\nlife) or adverse changes in economic and market conditions may cause a change in our evaluation of recoverability or our estimation of fair value and could result in an impairment charge that could be material to our financial statements.\nAllowance for doubtful accounts - Notes receivable\nWe reserve an estimated amount for notes receivables that may not be collected to reduce our receivables to their net carrying value. Methodologies for estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts range from specific reserves to various percentages applied to aged receivables. Estimations of doubtful accounts are focused on receivables which are more than 90 days past due. We review a variety of relevant qualitative information such as collection experience, economic conditions and customer-specific financial conditions to evaluate credit risk in recording the allowance for doubtful accounts or as an indicator of an impaired loan. We also evaluate the macroeconomic and political environment of our customers to determine if these factors are an indication that a contractual obligation may be at risk to be collected in full. We may be required to make judgments related to the above factors if the information is not easily accessible. We may also have instances where we do not have an established history with a customer which also limits our ability to evaluate customer specific factors. Unexpected changes in the underlying financial condition of our customers or in the macroeconomic and political environment of a specific geographic region could result in a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position. As of December 31, 2017, a 10% increase or decrease to the allowance determined within notes receivable would change the reserve by approximately $2.1 million.\nIncome taxes\nWe are subject to the income tax laws of the many jurisdictions in which we operate. These tax laws are complex, and the manner in which they apply to our facts is sometimes open to interpretation. In establishing the provision for income taxes, we must make judgments about the application of these inherently complex tax laws.\nDespite our belief that our tax return positions are consistent with applicable tax laws, we believe that taxing authorities could challenge certain positions. Settlement of any challenge can result in no change, a complete disallowance, or some partial adjustment reached through negotiations or litigation. We record tax benefits for uncertain tax positions based upon management's evaluation of the information available at the reporting date. To be recognized in the financial statements, a tax benefit must be at least more likely than not of being sustained based on technical merits. The benefit for positions meeting the recognition threshold is measured as the largest benefit more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. Significant judgment is required in making these determinations and adjustments to uncertain tax positions may be necessary to reflect actual taxes payable upon settlement. Adjustments related to positions impacting the effective tax rate affect the provision for income taxes. Adjustments related to positions impacting the timing of deductions impact deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nOur income tax positions and analysis are based on currently enacted tax law. Future changes in tax law could significantly impact the provision for income taxes, the amount of taxes payable, and the deferred tax asset and liability balances in future periods. Deferred tax assets generally represent tax benefits for tax deductions or credits available in future tax returns. Certain estimates and assumptions are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making this assessment, management analyzes and estimates the impact of future taxable income, available carry-backs and carry-forwards, reversing temporary differences and available prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. We have recorded valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. Should a change in facts or circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the ultimate realizability of a deferred tax asset, we record or adjust the related valuation allowance in the annual period that the change in facts and circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding increase or decrease in the provision for income taxes.\nLegal contingencies\nWe are subject to certain legal proceedings, demands, claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business. We review the status of each significant matter quarterly and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability and an expense for the estimated loss. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the range of the loss can be reasonably estimated, then we disclose the range of the possible loss. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether a potential loss is probable, reasonably possible, or remote and in the determination of whether a potential exposure is reasonably estimable. Our accruals are based on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the liabilities and disclosures related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Potential legal liabilities and the revision of estimates of legal liabilities could have a material impact on\nour results of operations, cash flows and financial position. For discussion of the Company's legal proceedings, see Note 22, which is incorporated by reference into Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND WORKING CAPITAL\nSources of liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2017, our principal sources of liquidity, other than cash flows provided by operating activities, were cash and cash equivalents and amounts available under our revolving credit facility discussed below under \"Credit Agreement and Other Debt.\"\nSubsequent to December 31, 2017, we successfully completed a series of financing transactions, including a private offering of an additional $900.0 million principal amount of our 2025 Secured Notes, \u20ac325.0 million of 3.375% new senior secured notes due 2026 and \u20ac250 million of 5.500% new senior unsecured notes due 2026, and an amendment to our credit agreement to refinance our existing term loan B-4 facility and increase the term loans outstanding by $900.0 million under a new term loan B-5 facility (collectively referred to as the February 2018 Refinancing\u201d). We used a portion of the net proceeds of the February 2018 Refinancing to redeem $1,400.0 million of our outstanding 2022 Secured Notes, prepay a portion of our revolver borrowings under our credit agreement and pay accrued and unpaid interest thereon plus related premiums, fees and expenses. We intend to use the remaining net proceeds to redeem the remaining $700.0 million of our outstanding 2022 Secured Notes and pay accrued and unpaid interest thereon plus related premiums on or around March 2, 2018. In connection with the amendment to our credit agreement, the interest rate on our term loans was decreased from LIBOR plus 325 to LIBOR plus 275. We also increased the amount of the revolving credit agreement by $24.0 million to $620.2 million through October 18, 2018, with a step-down in availability at that time to $445.7 million until the extended maturity on October 18, 2020. As a result of these financing transactions, we have lowered our annual cash interest cost by approximately $69.0 million at current interest rates and extended the maturity of $2,100.0 million of our debt from 2022 out to 2024, 2025 and 2026.\nSubsequent to the February 2018 Refinancing and following our intended redemption of our outstanding 2022 Secured Notes (described above), the aggregate principal amount of debt outstanding would be approximately $9.0 billion, based on a Euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate of 1.2288 as of February 21, 2018.\nIn December 2017, we entered into a lender joinder agreement to our credit agreement with an additional revolving commitment lender. Pursuant to the joinder agreement, the amount of the revolving credit facility under the credit agreement was increased by $40.0 million.\nIn October 2017, we successfully completed a private offering of $350.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2025 Secured Notes (the \"October Financing\"). We used the net proceeds of this offering, together with cash on hand and borrowings under the revolving credit facility under our credit agreement, to finance the NYX acquisition, including the refinancing of certain indebtedness of NYX, and to pay related fees and expenses.\nDuring the third quarter of 2017, we completed a refinancing transaction (the August 2017 Refinancing\u201d), which included an amendment to our credit agreement, which further extended the maturity of our term loans and reduced the applicable interest rate on the term loans. The August 2017 Refinancing further lowered our annual cash interest cost and extended the maturity of approximately 40% of our debt from 2021 to 2024.\nDuring the first quarter of 2017, we completed a series of refinancing transactions (the \"February 2017 Refinancing\"), which included a private offering of $1.15 billion in aggregate principal amount of 2022 Secured Notes, and an amendment to our credit agreement, which extended the maturity of our term loans and revolving credit facility and reduced the applicable interest rate on the term loans. The February 2017 Refinancing reduced the total principal value of our debt by $45.0 million, including payment of the remaining $45.0 million on our revolving credit facility; lowered our annual cash interest cost; extended the maturity to 2021 and 2022 for approximately 95% of our debt and significantly reduced our exposure to floating interest rates.\nOn January 10, 2018, in connection with the reincorporation merger, the Surviving Corporation assumed all of the obligations of SGC under the credit agreement, the Senior Notes and the Subordinated Notes, and became a guarantor of all of that indebtedness.\nFor further information on the February 2018 Refinancing, February 2017 Refinancing, the August 2017 Refinancing, the October 2017 Financing, the 2025 Secured Notes and the joinder agreement, see Note 16.\nCash and available revolver capacity\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>788.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>115.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolver capacity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>596.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>592.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolver capacity drawn or committed to letters of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(375.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(76.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,009.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>631.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe amount of our available cash and cash equivalents fluctuates principally based on borrowings or repayments under our credit facilities, investments, acquisitions and changes in our working capital position. The borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility will depend on the amount of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit issued and on us remaining in compliance with the covenants under our credit agreement, including a maintenance covenant based on consolidated net first lien leverage. Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2017 included funds that were held to complete the NYX acquisition on January 5, 2018. We were in compliance with the covenants under our credit agreement as of December 31, 2017.\nWe believe that our cash flow from operations, available cash and cash equivalents and available borrowing capacity under our existing or anticipated financing arrangements will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future; however, we cannot assure that this will be the case. We believe that substantially all cash held outside the U.S. is free from legal encumbrances or similar restrictions that would prevent it from being available to meet our global liquidity needs.\nTotal cash held by our foreign subsidiaries was $57.6 million as of December 31, 2017.\nOur Gaming operations and Lottery systems businesses generally require significant upfront capital expenditures. In connection with a renewal or bid of a Gaming operations or Lottery systems contract, a customer may seek to obtain new equipment or impose new service requirements, which may require additional capital expenditures in order to retain or win the contract. Our ability to generate revenue and to continue to procure new contracts will depend on, among other things, our then present liquidity levels or our ability to obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms. If we do not have adequate liquidity or are unable to obtain financing for these upfront cash payments on favorable terms or at all, we may not be able to bid on certain contracts, which could restrict our ability to grow and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and other obligations depends on our ability to generate cash in the future. We may also, from time to time, repurchase, or otherwise retire or refinance our debt, through our subsidiaries or otherwise. Such activities, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, contractual restrictions and other factors, and the amounts involved may or may not be material. If we need to refinance all or part of our indebtedness at or before maturity, we cannot assure that we will be able to obtain new financing or to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In the event we pursue significant acquisitions or other expansion opportunities, conduct significant repurchases of our outstanding securities, or refinance or repay existing debt, we may need to raise additional capital either through the public or private issuance of equity or debt securities or through additional borrowings under our existing financing arrangements, which sources of funds may not necessarily be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nIn addition, U.S. lottery customers generally require service providers to provide performance bonds in connection with the relevant contract. As of December 31, 2017, our outstanding performance bonds totaled $230.7 million. Our ability to obtain performance bonds on commercially reasonable terms is subject to our financial condition and to prevailing market conditions, which may be impacted by economic and political events. Although we have not experienced difficulty in obtaining such bonds to date, we cannot assure that we will continue to be able to obtain performance bonds on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nAs a result of the LNS concession renewal, described in Note 13, we are responsible for our pro rata share of the total \u20ac800 million payment required to be made by LNS to retain the lottery concession, which is \u20ac160.0 million. We funded \u20ac10 million of our share during the fourth quarter of 2017, with the remainder to be funded in April and October of 2018 in the amount of \u20ac60 million and \u20ac90 million, respectively. Contributions to LNS are expected to be funded out of existing cash and additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\nCash Flow Summary\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs. 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>507.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>419.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>414.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(414.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(228.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(269.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(186.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>580.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(196.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(183.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>776.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>677.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(49.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>687.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nCash flows from operating activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the prior year period increased primarily due to a $174.5 million increase in incremental net earnings after reconciling adjustments and changes in deferred taxes, partially offset by changes in working capital accounts as the prior year benefited from the timing of receivable collections and cash disbursements coupled with various other changes in our working capital accounts. The changes in our working capital accounts during the year ended December 31, 2017 were primarily driven by the following:\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$48.0 million increase in accounts and notes receivable due to strong sales during the year;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$2.2 million increase in inventories primarily due to the timing of orders and deployment of units in our Gaming segment; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$28.6 million positive net impact on cash flows from changes in other current assets and liabilities as a result of the timing of expenditures and interest payments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> In April 2017, we entered into a settlement and seven-year patent cross-license agreement with another party that resolved outstanding intellectual property matters between the two companies. As part of this agreement, we received a $20.0 million advance royalty payment.\nCash flows from investing activities\nNet cash used in investing activities increased primarily due to the business acquisitions described in Note 9, the November 2017 acquisition of 36% of the outstanding ordinary shares and other securities of NYX for $91.9 million described in Note 13 and $20.8 million in higher capital expenditures, primarily associated with our recently launched WAP and other participation units. Capital expenditures are composed of investments in systems, equipment and other assets related to contracts, property and equipment, intangible assets and software.\nCash flows from financing activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased primarily due to the February 2017 Refinancing, August 2017 Refinancing and October 2017 Financing transactions described in Note 16 and revolving credit facility borrowings in anticipation of closing the NYX acquisition on January 5, 2018, combined with lower principal payments on the long-term debt during the period. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we also incurred $58.7 million in debt issuance and deferred financing costs.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nCash flows from operating activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $4.8 million over the prior year. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the incremental net earnings, net of non-cash items of $97.3 million and a $92.5 million decrease in working capital and other items.\nCash flows from investing activities\nThe decrease in net cash used in investing activities of $32.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily reflected (1) a decrease of $13.4 million in distributions of capital on equity investments; (2) a decrease of capital expenditures of $50.7 million; (3) an incremental change in restricted cash of $9.6 million; and (4) an increase in proceeds from asset sales\nof $10.0 million compared to 2015. Capital expenditures are composed of investments in systems, equipment and other assets related to contracts, property and equipment, intangible assets and software.\nCash flows from financing activities\nThe increase in net cash used in financing activities of $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to: (1) an increase in the payments on license obligations of $9.7 million; and, (2) an increase in the net redemptions of Class A common stock under stock-based compensation plans of $5.2 million, partially offset by (3) a decrease in net payments of long-term debt of $1.6 million.\nCredit Agreement and Other Debt\nFor additional information regarding our credit agreement and other debt, interest rate risk and interest rate hedging instruments, see \"Contractual Obligations\" in this Item 7 below, and in Part II,", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion is intended to enhance the reader's understanding of our operations and current business environment and should be read in conjunction with the description of our business (see Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) and our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes (see Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d ( MD&A\u201d) contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and should be read in conjunction with the disclosures and information contained and referenced under \"Forward-Looking Statements\" and \"Risk Factors\" at the beginning and in Part I, Item 1A, respectively, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As used in this MD&A, the terms \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our\" and the \"Company\" mean Scientific Games Corporation together with its consolidated subsidiaries.\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW\nWe are a leading developer of technology-based products and services and associated content for the worldwide gaming, lottery and interactive gaming industries. Our portfolio includes gaming machines and game content, casino management systems, table game products and services, instant and draw-based lottery games, lottery systems, lottery content and services, interactive gaming and social casino solutions and other products and services. We also gain access to technologies and pursue global expansion through strategic acquisitions and equity investments.\nSGC was incorporated in the state of Delaware on July 2, 1984. On September 18, 2017, SGC entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with SG Nevada Merger Company, a Nevada corporation and SGC's wholly owned subsidiary Newco, providing for the merger of SGC with and into Newco with Newco surviving the merger, for the sole purpose of changing SGC's state of incorporation from Delaware to Nevada. Refer to Part I, Item 1 for additional details.\nHighlights, including recent developments:\nMergers and Acquisitions\n \u2022 In January 2018, we successfully completed the NYX acquisition, for an aggregate enterprise value of approximately $640.0 million. \n \u2022 During 2017, we also completed four smaller acquisitions, including Spricerack Media, Inc. and DEQ, which were accretive to our financial performance and expanded our portfolio of products.  Financings\n \u2022 Subsequent to December 31, 2017, we successfully completed a series of financing transactions, including a private offering of an additional $900.0 million principal amount of our 2025 Secured Notes, \u20ac325.0 million of 3.375% new senior secured notes due 2026 and \u20ac250 million of 5.500% new senior unsecured notes due 2026, and an amendment to our credit agreement to refinance our existing term loan B-4 facility and increase the term loans outstanding by $900.0 million under a new term loan B-5 facility. \n \u25e6 We used a portion of the net proceeds of these financing transactions to redeem $1,400.0 million of our outstanding 2022 Secured Notes, prepay a portion of our revolver borrowings under our credit agreement and pay accrued and unpaid interest thereon plus related premiums, fees and expenses. \n \u25e6 We intend to use the remaining net proceeds to redeem the remaining $700.0 million of our outstanding 2022 Secured Notes and pay accrued and unpaid interest thereon plus related premiums on or around March 2, 2018. \n \u25e6 In connection with the amendment to our credit agreement, the interest rate on our term loan was decreased from LIBOR plus 325 to LIBOR plus 275. \n \u25e6 We increased the amount of the revolving credit agreement by $24.0 million to $620.2 million through October 18, 2018, with a step-down in availability at that time to $445.7 million until the extended maturity on October 18, 2020. \n \u25e6 As a result of these financing transactions, we have lowered our annual cash interest cost by approximately $69.0 million at current interest rates and extended the maturity of $2,100.0 million of our debt from 2022 out to 2024, 2025 and 2026. \n \u2022 On January 10, 2018, in connection with the reincorporation merger, the Surviving Corporation assumed all of the obligations of SGC under the credit agreement, the Senior Notes and the Subordinated Notes, and became a guarantor of all of that indebtedness. \n \u2022 During 2017, we successfully completed a series of refinancing transactions, including a private offering of $1.15 billion in aggregate principal amount of 2022 Secured Notes and amendments to our credit agreement that extended the maturity of our term loans and revolving credit facility and reduced the applicable interest rate on the term loans. These actions reduced the total principal amount of our debt by $45.0 million, including payment of the remaining $45.0 million on our revolving credit facility, lowered our annual cash interest cost and significantly reduced our exposure to floating interest rates. \n \u2022 In March 2017, we redeemed all $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 2018 Notes. \n \u2022 In October 2017, we successfully completed the initial offering of our 2025 Secured Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $350.0 million.  Expanding our Customer Base\n \u2022 In December 2017, LNS accepted a contract extension of up to nine years for the Italian Scratch and Win concession. \n \u2022 In July 2017, we were awarded a new, six-year contract as the primary instant games provider for the Colorado Lottery. \n \u2022 In June 2017, we were awarded a new, four-year contract to provide instant games and additional services to the New Hampshire Lottery. \n \u2022 In June 2017, we were awarded a new, eight-year systems technology and services contract from the Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Agency. \nTrends and Uncertainties\nWe continue to experience challenges that are representative of trends and uncertainties that may affect our business and results of operations. We are a highly leveraged company which presents several challenges, including the dedication of a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to service interest and principal payments on our indebtedness. Additional challenges we face relate to expanding our footprint within international markets and the related process of obtaining regulatory approvals to provide services and products within these new and emerging markets. A third set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape. Our major competitors are expanding their product and service offerings with integrated products and solutions. We are also faced with challenges related to foreign currency risk. Our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses.\nReportable Segments\nThe segment amounts included in MD&A are presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting as of December 31, 2017. Segment information appearing in Note 2 is also presented on this basis. At the end of fiscal 2017, we had three business segments for financial reporting purposes - Gaming, Lottery and Interactive.\nAs a result of the NYX acquisition (see Note 9) and starting with the first quarter 2018 reporting period, we will report our operations in four business segments, representing our different products and services: Gaming, Lottery, Social and Digital.\nCONSOLIDATED

2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nGaming revenue increased in 2017, primarily due to higher gaming machine sales, placement of table products and hardware sales partially offset by a decrease in WAP and premium game revenue. The gaming revenue increase included the unfavorable impact of $1.6 million from foreign currency.\nLottery revenue increased in 2017, primarily due to higher revenues from our participation and PPU contracts, launching of WILLY WONKA GOLDEN TICKET\u2122 multi-state instant game and higher international terminal and software sales. Lottery increases included the unfavorable foreign currency impact of $1.6 million.\nInteractive revenue increased in 2017, primarily due to 32% growth in our social gaming B2C business reflecting the ongoing popularity of Jackpot Party\u00ae Social Casino and the success of more recent apps, such as the introduction of the 88 Fortunes\u00ae app in the first quarter of 2017, combined with the acquisition of Spicerack, which closed in April 2017, and its Bingo Showdown social gaming app.\nOperating expenses\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs. 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Cost of services(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>417.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>396.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>372.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Cost of product sales(1)\n</td> <td>465.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>424.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>405.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Cost of instant games(1)\n</td> <td>282.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>285.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>325.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(40.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>613.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>577.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>567.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>184.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>204.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>183.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation, amortization and impairments\n</td> <td>682.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>738.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>903.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(55.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(164.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill impairments\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,002.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(69.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(933.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(93\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and other\n</td> <td>45.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>160\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,690.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,752.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,783.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(62.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,030.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Exclusive of D&A.\nCost of revenue\nConsolidated cost of revenue increased by $58.3 million in 2017, including (1) a $40.6 million higher cost of Interactive services primarily related to platform fees associated with the $87.6 million increase in Interactive social revenue; (2) a $11.4 million increase in Lottery cost of product sales driven primarily by increased terminal and software sales; and (3) a $29.3 million increase in Gaming cost of product sales driven by increased gaming machine and hardware sales; partially offset by $20.4 million decrease in gaming cost of services reflecting lower gaming operations revenue and lower third party royalty costs.\nSG&A\nThe increase in SG&A of $36.1 million in 2017 was primarily due to the following: (1) an increase in Interactive SG&A of $25.0 million, primarily driven by additional marketing spend and user acquisition costs related to our growing portfolio of social and mobile gaming apps; (2) a $24.7 million increase in salaries and benefits primarily reflecting higher incentive compensation commensurate with the Company's overall performance and to the lesser extent increased headcount; and (3) a $24.1 million increase in professional and legal fees. This increase was partially offset by benefits realized in the current year from the November 2016 business improvement initiative. The prior year also included $7.5 million of insurance proceeds recorded during the second quarter of 2016 in connection with a settlement of a legal matter.\nR&D\nThe decrease in R&D was primarily driven by reduced spending on outside resources for certain projects and headcount reduction completed as a part of the November 2016 business improvement initiative.\nDepreciation, amortization and impairments\nD&A decreased by $55.9 million in 2017 primarily due to certain acquired intangible assets from the 2013 WMS acquisition and 2014 Bally acquisition becoming fully depreciated in the third quarter of 2016, and acquired Gaming assets for which accelerated depreciation was recorded in the prior comparable period.\nGoodwill impairments\nDuring 2016, we recorded an impairment charge of $69.0 million to reduce the carrying value of our International Lottery Systems reporting unit's goodwill balance to its implied fair value. See Note 11 for additional information.\nRestructuring and other\nRestructuring and other costs decreased $11.1 million in 2017, primarily associated with costs incurred in 2016 related to the November 2016 business improvement initiative partially offset by acquisition-related costs associated with NYX acquisition.

The gaming revenue decrease included the negative impact of $22.4 million from foreign currency.\nLottery revenue increased in 2016 primarily due to higher U.S revenue, mostly driven by an increase in U.S. instant game sales revenue with particular strength in Participation contracts and from CSP customers for whom we provide our integrated CSP offerings and increased retail sales of multi-state games including sales leading up to the record $1.6 billion POWERBALL jackpot in January 2016. These increases were offset by an unfavorable $21.7 million impact from the expiration of the CSL validation contract in January 2016 and a negative $9.1 million impact from foreign currency.\nInteractive revenue increased in 2016 primarily due to 60.8% growth in our social gaming B2C business reflecting the ongoing popularity of Jackpot Party Social Casino and the success of our recently launched Quick Hit\u00ae Slots, Hot Shot Casino\u00ae and Blazing 7s Slots\u2122 social gaming apps.\nCost of revenue\nConsolidated cost of revenue increased by $2.2 million in 2016, including (1) a $26.7 million increase in cost of unit shipments in Gaming resulting from the introduction of the TwinStar\u00ae Dual-Screen and TwinStar J43\u2122 Video gaming machines which generally carry higher costs at launch and trend lower as they mature; (2) a $48.9 million increase in the cost of Interactive services primarily related to volume-driven increase in the third-party platform fees on the $122.8 million increase in Interactive revenues, which was offset by; (3) a decrease of $25.1 million in gaming costs primarily associated with placement of WAP, premium and other leased machines as operators have removed more of these machines from their gaming floors; (4) an $11.0 million decrease in costs related to systems and hardware sales; and (5) a $40.7 million reduction in cost of instant games primarily due to the cancellation of the MONOPOLYTM MILLIONAIRES' CLUB (MMC) game.\nSG&A\nThe increase in SG&A of $9.3 million in 2016 was primarily due to the following: (1) a $34.9 million increase in marketing primarily driven by Interactive marketing and player acquisition costs related to new games launched in 2016 and the increased marketing related to our Jackpot Party Social Casino app; (2) a $9.9 million increase in stock-based compensation, primarily attributable to the accelerated recognition of certain stock based compensation, which was offset by; (3) a $15.4 million decrease in salaries and benefits resulting from headcount actions; and (4) a $21.2 million decrease in professional and legal fees, which includes a $7.5 million credit related to insurance proceeds received during the second quarter of 2016 in connection with the settlement of a legal matter.\nR&D\nR&D increased by $20.9 million in 2016, primarily driven by higher investments in new product and app development across each of our business segments.\nDepreciation, amortization and impairments\nD&A decreased by $164.5 million in 2016 and was primarily due to the following: (1) the non-recurrence of $128.6 million of intangible asset impairment charges recognized in 2015 which reduced the carrying value of two trade name assets to their fair value; (2) the impact from the expiration of the CSL validation contract in January 2016; and (3) an $11.9 million impairment of the MMC game studio recognized in 2015 which did not recur in 2016.\nGoodwill impairments\nDuring 2016, we recorded an impairment charge of $69.0 million to reduce the carrying value of our International Lottery Systems reporting unit's goodwill balance to its implied fair value. During 2015, we recorded an aggregate goodwill impairment charges of $1,002.6 million to reduce the carrying value of our SG Gaming and U.S. Lottery Systems reporting units' goodwill balances to their implied fair value. See Note 11 for additional information.\nRestructuring and other\nRestructuring and other costs increased $35.1 million in 2016 primarily associated with the business improvement initiative which was announced on November 3, 2016. See Note 4 for additional information.\nBUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS\nThe types of products and services from which our segments derive their revenues are further discussed in Notes 2 and 3. Certain financial information relating to our segments, including segment revenue, operating income (loss) and total assets for the last three fiscal years and certain financial information relating to our revenue derived from and assets located in the U.S. and other geographic areas is included in Note 2.\nGAMING\nOur Gaming business segment designs, develops, manufactures, markets and distributes a comprehensive portfolio of gaming products and services. We provide our Gaming portfolio of products and services to commercial casinos, Native American casinos, wide-area gaming operators such as LBOs, arcade and bingo operators in the U.K. and continental Europe, and government agencies and their affiliated operators. Our equity investments in RCN and International Terminal Leasing are part of our Gaming business segment.\nThe following table summarizes the primary business activities included in our Gaming business segment.\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Product sales\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gaming operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Service revenues from gaming operations are derived from WAP, premium and daily-fee Participation gaming machines and other leased gaming machines (including VLTs and electronic table games) and other services revenue from leasing game themes or other licensing arrangements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gaming machine sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Sale of new and used gaming machines, ETSs and VLTs, conversion game kits and spare parts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gaming systems\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>We provide services which include installation and support of casino management systems, including ongoing hardware maintenance and software upgrade services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>We offer core slot, casino and table-management systems (collectively, \"casino-management systems\") that help our customers improve communication with players, add excitement to the gaming floor and enhance operating efficiencies.

We categorize our Participation gaming machines as (1) WAP, premium and daily fee Participation games and (2) other leased and Participation games.\nWAP, premium and daily fee Participation games\n \u2022 WAP Participation games: WAP Participation games are electronically linked gaming machines that are located across multiple casinos within a single gaming jurisdiction or across Native American gaming jurisdictions. Players across linked gaming machines contribute to and compete for system-wide progressive jackpots that are designed to increase gaming machine play for participating casinos by giving the players the opportunity to win a larger jackpot than on a non-WAP gaming machine. We are responsible for funding WAP jackpots. We create WAP games using our proprietary brands and also using licensed brands. We operate our WAP systems in six states throughout the U.S. and in certain Native American casinos.  Premium and daily fee Participation games: We offer two categories of non-WAP premium and daily fee Participation games: LAP and standalone. LAP games are gaming machines that are located within a single casino and are electronically linked to a progressive jackpot for that specific casino. Our LAP gaming machines feature games including those offered as WAP and our proprietary brands such as Jackpot Party Progressive\u00ae, Life of Luxury\u00ae Progressive, 88 Fortunes, 5 Treasures\u00ae, and Cash Spin. Our LAP products leverage both exclusive brand names and game play intellectual property, and typically offer players the chance to win multiple progressive jackpots, all of which tend to result in higher play volumes. We also provide certain standalone Participation games that are not linked to other gaming machines. Our standalone games feature titles under licensed brands and our\nproprietary brands. Our standalone Participation gaming machines generally feature larger, more elaborate top-boxes and provide game play experiences not possible on a single screen game or on gaming machines that we sell.\nOther leased and Participation games\n \u2022 Server-based gaming: We provide wide-area gaming operators, such as LBOs, bingo halls and arcades, a comprehensive package of server-based products and services under long term contracts that typically include gaming machines, remote management of game content and management information, central computer systems, secure data communication and field support services. We are typically paid a fee based on the Net win generated by these gaming machines (subject to certain adjustments as may be specified in a particular contract, including adjustments for taxes and other fees). Our business in this category is primarily based in the U.K. \n \u2022 VLTs: For certain customers, we provide our multi-game and single-game VLTs, which include video gaming machines, mechanical reel gaming machines and video poker games. Our VLTs may be operated as standalone units or may interface with central monitoring systems operated by government agencies. Our VLTs are typically located in places where casino-style gaming is not the only attraction, such as racetracks, bars and restaurants. \n \u2022 Class II and centrally determined systems: We offer video and mechanical-reel gaming machines and VLTs for Class II and certain VLT jurisdictions where the game outcome is determined by a central server system that we provide. These Class II and centrally determined systems primarily operate in Native American casinos in Washington, Florida, Alabama and Oklahoma. We receive either a fixed daily fee or a percentage of the Net win generated by the gaming machines or VLTs connected to the central determination system and a small daily fee for the central determination system.  Gaming Machine Sales\nThe majority of our product sales are derived from sales of gaming machines and VLTs that use a combination of advanced graphics, mechanical reels, digital music and sounds and secondary bonus games. We also sell ETSs to either meet the needs of particular locations where live tables are not allowed or as productivity-enhancing solutions for other jurisdictions.\nGaming Systems\nOur comprehensive suite of technology solutions provides gaming operations of every size with a wide range of marketing, data management and analysis, accounting, player tracking, security and other applications and tools to more effectively manage their operations. Gaming systems products include the iVIEW\u00ae touch screen display, which facilitates the player experience, bonus features, customer service, and employee functions. Gaming systems revenues related to core system solutions are highly dependent on new installations. Gaming system revenues are also generated through ongoing hardware and software maintenance services and upgrades.\nTable Products\nOur table product sales are generated primarily from the sale of products designed to enhance table game speed, productivity, profitability and security. Our product offerings include various models of Shufflers to suit specific games.\nWe offer Shuffler products under month-to-month arrangements that contain Participation rates or fixed monthly rates. These arrangements include service of the product with back-up and replacement products available at the customer's request.\nWe license our PTG content to commercial, tribal and governmental casino operators typically under month to month arrangements based on fixed monthly rates. PTGs which are designed to enhance operators' table-game operations, include our internally developed and acquired PTGs, side bets, add-ons and progressive features. Our proprietary content and features are also added to public domain games such as poker, baccarat, pai gow poker, craps and blackjack table games and to electronic platforms.\nRevenues from our Gaming products and services to external customers accounted for 60%, 61% and 64% of our total revenues in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nCurrent year update\nDespite strong gaming machine sales during 2017, we believe the market for gaming machine sales was challenging during 2017 and could remain challenging in the near term. These challenges included: (1) restrained investment in new replacement gaming machines by our existing customers; (2) increased competition for new systems, gaming operations, gaming machines and table products businesses; and (3) other economic and regulatory pressures that affect our business operations globally.\nFor 2018, we expect to continue to face pricing pressure in our Gaming segment. We anticipate that replacement demand for gaming machines and constraints on capital spending by gaming operators will continue at current levels. We anticipate that demand for our gaming systems products and services could increase due to several Canadian contracts and related new system implementations during 2018; however, timing can fluctuate based on actual installations of the solutions. We believe we have begun to stabilize the erosion in the installed base of WAP, premium and daily-fee Participation gaming machines. In 2017, we demonstrated a significant breadth and depth of innovative new products that we expect to launch in the year ahead to support our target of growing the overall category. These products were headlined by three JAMES BOND themed games showcased on our new Gamefield 2.0TM and TwinStar J43 iReels cabinets.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, our contracts with two of the large U.K. bookmakers represented a significant portion of our U.K. LBO server-based gaming business. Our current contract with Ladbrokes plc ( Ladbrokes\u201d) commenced on October 22, 2013 and is scheduled to expire on March 31, 2019. Our current contract with Gala Coral Group Ltd. ( Gala Coral\u201d) commenced on January 1, 2010 and expired on December 31, 2017, with the parties continuing to operating under the current contract terms and conditions, until ongoing negotiations (described below) are concluded. In October 2016, Ladbrokes and Gala Coral merged. We are currently in negotiation with LadbrokesCoral Group about a new contract for the merged entity, with negotiation expected to be completed in 2018.\nResults of Operations and Key Performance

Operations\nGaming operations revenue decreased in 2017 in part due to: (1) a 823 unit decrease in the installed base of WAP, premium and daily-fee Participation gaming machines; (2) a decrease in the average daily revenue per WAP, premium and daily-fee Participation units primarily reflecting a lower mix of high-yielding WAP games; and (3) a decrease in the average daily revenue per Other Participation and leased units, which was partially offset by a 785 unit increase in installed base of other participation and leased units.\nGaming Machine Sales\nGaming machine unit sales increased due to higher unit shipments primarily resulting from sales and strong performance of the TwinStar family of gaming machines, along with continued strong sales of the Pro Wave\u00ae cabinet.\nU.S. and Canadian shipments encompassed 15,015 replacement units, including 250 Oregon VLT units (which completed the contract), and 5,466 units for new casino openings and expansions, including 2,469 Illinois VGT units. International shipments encompassed 12,308 replacement units and 949 units for new casino openings and expansions. The average sales price increased to $17,231 per unit reflecting a greater mix of higher-priced premium gaming machines sold during the period.\nGaming Systems\nGaming systems sales increased in 2017 due to increased hardware sales, driven by placements of the iView 4 hardware products, with significant sales to Tribal gaming customers, coupled with the new gaming system implementations in the province of Alberta.\nTable Products\nTable products revenue increased in 2017 primarily due to increased Shuffler sales, table product placements and the impact of the acquisition of DEQ Systems Corp., which closed in January 2017.\nOperating income\nThe increase in operating income in 2017 was primarily attributable to the following: (1) higher overall gaming revenues as described above; (2) a decrease in overall operating expenses primarily due to the November 2016 business improvement initiative; (3) lower D&A of $64.4 million for the period due to certain acquired intangible assets becoming fully amortized in the third quarter of 2016, and acquired Gaming assets for which accelerated depreciation was recorded in the prior comparable period; and (4) a more profitable revenue mix, which was primarily due to an increase in Gaming systems sales.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nGaming Operations\nGaming operations revenue decreased in 2016 in part due to: (1) a 787 unit decrease in the installed base of WAP, premium and daily-fee Participation gaming machines; (2) a decrease in the average daily revenue per WAP, premium and daily-fee Participation units primarily reflecting a lower mix of high-yielding WAP games; (3) a 475 unit decrease in the ending installed base for Other Participation and leased units; and (4) a decrease in the average daily revenue per Other Participation and leased units. As a result of the third quarter release of our GameScape\u2122 cabinet, our WAP installed base at the end of the fourth quarter of 2016 was up approximately 1% on a sequential quarter basis.\nGaming Machine Sales\nGaming machine unit sales increased due to higher global unit shipments primarily resulting from sales of the Pro Series WAVE (released in 2014), and the TwinStar and Dualos cabinets, both released in 2015.\nU.S. and Canadian shipments encompassed 13,969 replacement units, including 1,271 Oregon VLT units (which completed the shipment under the related contract), and 4,211 units for new casino openings and expansions, including 1,700 Illinois VGT units. International shipments encompassed 11,956 replacement units and 1,474 units for new casino openings and expansions. The average sales price increased to $16,647 per unit, reflecting a greater mix of higher-performing premium gaming machines sold during the period.\nGaming Systems\nGaming systems sales decreased in 2016 due to lower hardware, software and services sales resulting from fewer large, multi-site opportunities, system replacements and new casino openings in 2016. The decreases were partially offset by a 5% increase in systems maintenance revenue.\nTable Products\nTable products revenue increased due to increased Shuffler sales driven by sales into Asian markets and a 5% increase in revenue from leased Shufflers, PTGs and progressives primarily due to the success of the Blazing 7s BlackjackTM Progressive.\nOperating income\nThe increase in operating income was primarily attributable to the following: (1) the non-recurrence of a 2015 goodwill impairment charge; (2) a decrease in overall operating expenses primarily due to realized integration cost synergies largely implemented in prior periods, including lower SG&A expense of $37.1 million for the year which benefited from $7.5 million of insurance proceeds received in connection with the settlement of a legal matter; and (3) lower D&A expense of $143.3 million, driven by the non-recurrence of 2015 intangible asset impairments which totaled $128.6 million; partially offset by (4) a less profitable revenue mix, which was due to an increase in lower-margin Gaming machine sales revenue and a decline in higher-margin Gaming systems and Gaming operations revenue.\nLOTTERY\nThe Lottery segment is primarily comprised of our systems-based services and product sales business and our instant games business. Our systems-based services and product sales business provides customized computer software, software support, equipment and data communication services, sports wagering systems and keno to lotteries. In the U.S., we typically provide the\nnecessary POS terminals and equipment, software and maintenance services on a Participation basis under long-term contracts that typically have an initial term of at least five years. Internationally, we typically sell POS terminals and/or computer software to lottery authorities and may provide ongoing fee-based systems maintenance and software support services.\nOur instant games business generates revenue from the manufacture and sale of instant games, and the provision of value-added services such as game design, sales and marketing support, specialty games and promotions, inventory management, warehousing, fulfillment services, and full instant game category management. In addition, we provide licensed games, promotional entertainment and internet-based marketing services to the lottery industry. These revenues are presented as instant games revenue.\nOur equity investments in LNS, Northstar Illinois, Northstar New Jersey, CSG, Hellenic Lotteries and GLB are included in the Lottery segment.\nThe following table summarizes the primary business activities included in the Lottery business segment.\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Product Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Instant Games\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Instant products - Participation and PPU(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Designing, printing and selling instant lottery games\nProviding instant game-related services, such as game design, sales and marketing support and inventory management\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Instant products - licensing and player loyalty\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Supplying player loyalty programs, merchandising services and interactive marketing campaigns\nSublicensing brands for lottery products and providing lottery-related promotional products\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lottery systems - services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Providing software, hardware and related services for lottery operations: including draw systems, instant ticket validation systems, sports wagering and keno systems\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Providing lottery systems hardware to customers where we have an ongoing services arrangement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lottery systems - sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Lottery systems software maintenance and support\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Providing lottery systems, including hardware, software, and instant game validation systems\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) See Instant Lottery Games below.\nInstant Lottery Games\nWe generate revenue from the sale of instant lottery games. Some of our contracts bundle the design and manufacturing of instant lottery games, instant game management systems and marketing and other services, such as the design and installation of game management software, inventory and distribution, sales, accounting, training and advisory services, market research and retailer training and recruitment. We are typically paid on a Participation basis under these contracts. We believe these services help lotteries effectively manage and support their operations, achieve higher retail sales and lower operating costs. We also provide licensed games and promotional and interactive marketing services to the lottery industry.\nWe market instant lottery games and related services to U.S. and international lotteries and commercial customers. We supply instant lottery games to 39 of the 44 U.S. jurisdictions that sell instant lottery games and have sold instant lottery games to customers in approximately 50 countries. Our U.S. instant lottery game contracts customarily have an initial term of three to five years and frequently include multiple renewal options for additional periods ranging from one to five years, which our customers have generally exercised in the past. We usually sell our instant lottery games on a PPU (meaning instant games sold to customer at a fixed price per unit) or Participation basis. Certain of our international customers purchase instant lottery games as needed rather than under multi-game supply contracts.\nWe provide lotteries with access to some of the world's most popular entertainment brands on lottery products, which we believe helps increase our customers' instant game sales. Our licensed entertainment brands include AMC\u00ae THE WALKING DEAD\u00ae, HARLEY-DAVIDSON\u00ae, LOTERIATM, MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL\u00ae, MARGARITAVILLE\u00ae, MONOPOLY, NATIONAL BASKETBALL ASSOCIATION, THE PRICE IS RIGHT\u00ae and SLINGO\u00ae. We also provide branded merchandise, advertising, promotional support, drawing management services and prize fulfillment programs. In addition, we offer lotteries interactive\nmarketing services through our Loyalty Plus program which features players clubs, reward programs, second chance promotional websites, interactive games and subscription systems that enable players to purchase lottery games securely over the internet.\nLottery Systems\nWe are a leading provider of lottery systems including customized computer software, software support, equipment, and data communication services, to lotteries world-wide. Our U.S. arrangements ordinarily include the following: (1) provision of the necessary equipment (including POS terminals) and (2) software and maintenance services pursuant to long-term contracts that typically have an initial term of at least five years under which we are generally paid a fee equal to a percentage of the lottery's total retail sales. Our U.S. contracts commonly include multiple renewal options that generally have been exercised by our customers in the past. Internationally, we primarily sell: (1) POS terminals and/or computer software and hardware to lottery authorities; and (2) provide ongoing fee-based systems and software support services.\nOur lottery systems use proprietary technology that facilitates high-speed processing of draw lottery game wagers and validation of winning draw and instant lottery games. This business includes the supply of proprietary transaction-processing software, draw lottery games, keno, point-of-sale terminals, central site computers and communication platforms and ongoing operational support and maintenance services. We have contracts to operate lottery systems for 10 of the 46 U.S. jurisdictions that operate draw lotteries. Internationally, we have lottery systems operating in 14 countries including Canada and China.\nThe fees we earn under our lottery systems contracts are generally included in our services revenue. Revenue from the sale of our POS terminals and/or computer software is included in our product sales revenue, while the fees we generate from ongoing systems and software support are generally included in our services revenue.\nWe have equity investments in LNS, Northstar New Jersey, Hellenic Lotteries, CSG and GLB, which entities operate or assist in the operation of lotteries. We are also the primary provider of instant lottery games to LNS and Northstar New Jersey and the exclusive provider of instant lottery games to Camelot Illinois, LLC and Hellenic Lotteries. Additional information regarding these equity investments is included in Note 13.\nRevenues from our Lottery products and services to external customers accounted for 26%, 27% and 28% of our total revenues in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nCurrent year update\nWe believe we will continue to face intense price-based competition in our Lottery business in 2018. In the near term, we also expect to see an increase in the number of jurisdictions that seek to privatize or outsource lottery operations and to face strong competition from both traditional and new competitors with respect to these opportunities. In addition, we anticipate that lottery RFPs, specifically those for PMA arrangements and certain of our international customers, could increasingly include terms that expose us to increased risk, such as requiring the guarantee of specific income thresholds or significant upfront payments. Also, the renewal of the LNS concession for up to nine years will result in the continuation of our instant lottery games supply agreement for the term of the renewal, under which we are the primary provider of instant lottery games to LNS.\nResults of Operations and Key Performance Indicators\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

include only sales of instant games.\n(3) U.S. lottery systems customers' retail sales primarily include sales of draw games, keno and instant games validated by the relevant system.\n(4) Retail sales may not have a direct correlation to our revenue due to terms of our contracts, the impact of changes in our contracts or other factors.\nPrimary factors affecting total higher Lottery revenue in 2017 were: (1) a $14.3 million increase in instant product revenues driven by higher revenues in Participation and PPU contracts coupled with launching of WILLY WONKA GOLDEN TICKET\u2122 multi-state instant licensed game; and (2) a $19.3 million increase in lottery systems revenues for the period driven by higher domestic and international terminal and software sales. Lottery revenues included unfavorable foreign currency impact on revenue (primarily in the U.K.) totaling $1.6 million for year ended December 31, 2017.\nOperating income\nOperating income increased in 2017 primarily due to a more profitable revenue mix and the following key factors: (1) a decrease in D&A totaling $16.4 million driven by certain Lottery systems equipment becoming fully depreciated during 2016 and write-off of equipment associated with a cancelled contract in 2016; and (2) a decrease in SG&A of $6.3 million primarily due to the November 2016 business improvement initiative. The year ended December 31, 2016 also included a $69.0 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge.\nEarnings from equity investments\nThe increase in earnings from equity investments of $13.7 million was primarily due to an $11.3 million impairment charge recorded during the year ended December 31, 2016 related to an equity investment in China.\nAs a result of the LNS concession renewal described above and in Note 13, LNS is required to pay \u20ac800 million in upfront fees. The upfront fees will be amortized by LNS (anticipated to be approximately \u20ac89 million each year on a pre-tax basis and commencing in September 2019), which will reduce our equity in earnings of LNS. Our share of the amortization expense is expected to be approximately \u20ac18 million each year on a pre-tax basis.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nRevenue\nPrimary factors affecting the slight increase in total Lottery revenue in 2016 were: (1) continued strength in Participation and PPU contracts (especially with customers having a CSP contract) which increased instant games revenue by $27.4 million; and (2) U.S. revenue from retail sales of multi-state games which increased total revenue by $6.6 million, which were partially offset by; (3) the expiration of the CSL validation contract which had a negative $21.7 million impact on services revenue; (4) an\nunfavorable impact on revenue from foreign currency (primarily in the U.K.) totaling $9.1 million; and (5) a decrease of $2.7 million in other product sales revenues.\nOperating income\nOperating income increased primarily due to: (1) a more profitable revenue mix and the non-recurrence of a $35.5 million charge related to other asset impairments and certain cancellation costs of MMC included in cost of instant games sales in 2015, which reduced cost of sales by $42.0 million; and (2) a decrease in D&A totaling $29.5 million. The decreases in cost of sales and D&A are primarily attributable to the cancellation of the MONOPOLY MILLIONAIRES' CLUB TV game show in 2015.\nEarnings from equity investments\nThe decrease in earnings from equity investments of $5.1 million was primarily due to an $11.3 million impairment charge recorded during the year ended December 31, 2016 related to an equity investment in China.\nINTERACTIVE\nThe following table summarizes the primary business activities included in the Interactive business segment as of December 31, 2017.\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Services\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Social\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Operating social casino-style, slot-based games and bingo-based games through Facebook, iOS, Android and various other desktop and mobile platforms\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> RMG\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Provision of content, via remote game server technology, to licensed online casino operators on both desktop and mobile platforms\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> SG Universe\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Provision of play-for-fun and play-for-free white-label gaming for traditional land-based casinos through SG Universe\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSocial Gaming\nIn our social gaming business, we generate revenue from the sale of virtual coins, chips or bingo cards, which players can use to play slot, table games or bingo games (i.e., spin in the case of slot games, bet in the case of table games and use of bingo cards in the case of bingo games). The games are primarily our WMS, Bally, Barcrest, SHFL, Dragonplay\u00ae and recently acquired Bingo Showdown branded games. In addition, we also offer third-party branded games and original content.\nOur apps include Jackpot Party Social Casino, Gold Fish\u00ae Casino Slots, Quick Hit Slots and Hot Shot Casino, Dragonplay Slots\u00ae, Dragonplay Poker\u00ae, Blazing 7s Slots and Bingo Showdown on various platforms which include: Facebook, Apple, Google Play, Amazon Kindle, Yahoo (through March 2016) and Microsoft Windows.\nRMG\nIn our RMG business, we provide game content to real-money online casino operators, primarily in Europe. We host the play of our game content on our centrally-located servers (often referred to as remote game servers) that are integrated with the online casino operators' websites and mobile applications. We typically earn a percentage of the operator's net gaming revenue generated by the games we host.\nSG Universe\nSG Universe includes Play4Fun NetworkTM interactive services for land based casino operators under which we provide our customers the ability to customize marketing to players while giving players access to their loyalty reward credits and the ability to make on-property reservations. We host play-for-fun and play-for-free services for traditional land-based casinos and earn revenue based on fixed fees, a share of the proceeds from the sale of virtual coins, or a mix of fixed fees and a share of such proceeds. We provide a social casino platform delivered through a land based casino operator's branded website and mobile application.\nWe believe that growth in our Interactive business is driven largely through new channels of distribution, such as the various types of mobile gaming platforms, the expansion of legal interactive RMG jurisdictions, the addition of social gaming products, the number and quality of our proprietary and third-party branded games released and available to players, the addition of\ntraditional land-based casino operators and RMG operators that are not currently customers, the effectiveness of our marketing efforts designed to engage new players and re-engage existing players, and the prominence of our offerings on operators' websites, which we do not control.\nRevenues from our Interactive services to external customers accounted for 14%, 12% and 8% of our total revenues in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nAs described in Note 13, during the fourth quarter of 2017, we acquired a non-controlling interest in NYX, which is a leading digital gaming software supplier for interactive, social and mobile gaming worldwide. On January 5, 2018, we successfully completed the NYX acquisition.\nCurrent year update\nWe continue to pursue our multi-product strategy in our social gaming B2C business and, late in the first quarter of 2017, we launched 88 Fortunes Slots on mobile worldwide.\nOn April 7, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Spicerack, a privately held mobile and social game company, which has allowed us to incorporate the successful Bingo Showdown game into our portfolio.\nOn July 7, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Red7, a privately held U.K.-based mobile and interactive casino content

As stated in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe that the estimates, assumptions, and judgments involved in the following accounting policies have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements:\n \u2022 Revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements; \n \u2022 Goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles, long lived assets and finite lived intangible assets- impairment assessment; \n \u2022 Allowance for doubtful accounts - Notes receivable; \n \u2022 Income taxes; and \n \u2022 Legal contingencies. \nRevenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements\nSome of our arrangements include multiple elements. As a result, significant contract interpretation may be required to determine the appropriate accounting, including the identification of deliverables considered to be separate units of accounting, the allocation of the transaction price among elements in the arrangement and the timing of revenue recognition for each of those elements.\nWe recognize revenue for delivered elements as separate units of accounting when the delivered elements have standalone value to the customer. For elements with no standalone value, we recognize revenue consistent with the pattern of\nthe delivery of the final deliverable. In arrangements with combined units of accounting, changes in the allocation of the transaction price among elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition for the contract but will not change the total revenue recognized for the contract.\nWe establish the selling prices used for each non-software deliverable based on vendor specific objective evidence ( VSOE\u201d) of selling price, if available, third-party evidence ( TPE\u201d), if VSOE of selling price is not available, or estimated selling price ( ESP\u201d), if neither VSOE of selling price nor TPE is available. We establish VSOE of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and, in rare instances, using the price established by management having the relevant authority. We evaluate TPE of selling price by reviewing largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers. ESP is established based on management's judgment considering internal factors such as margin objectives, pricing practices, customer segment pricing strategies and the product life cycle. Consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and industry technology life cycles. In most arrangements with multiple elements, the transaction price is allocated to the individual units of accounting at inception of the arrangement based on their relative selling price.\nFor software elements, we follow the industry specific software guidance which only allows for the use of VSOE in establishing fair value. Generally, VSOE of fair value is the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately or the price established by management for a product that is not yet sold. ESPs are established as best estimates of what the selling prices would be if the deliverables were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The ESP for software elements is based on the criteria explained in the preceding paragraph. We are required to use judgment and consider multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. If we were to change any of these judgments or estimates, it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period. Amounts for fees collected or invoiced and due relating to arrangements where revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized when the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied.\nGoodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units on at least an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) annually (October 1) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.\nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment, if any, for each reporting unit. This is especially true for reporting units where goodwill has been partially impaired as a result of recent impairment assessments, and accordingly, is at risk of additional partial or total impairment should we experience relatively minor adverse changes in our significant assumptions. Recent goodwill impairments (see Note 11) are as follows:\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reporting Unit\n</td> <td>Year\n</td> <td>Impairment charge\n</td> <td>Tax benefit\n</td> <td>Goodwill (at December 31, 2017)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International Lottery Systems\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>$69.0\n</td> <td>$14.5\n</td> <td>$23.5\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SG Gaming\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>$935.0\n</td> <td>None\n</td> <td>$1,094.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Lottery Systems\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>$67.6\n</td> <td>$24.9\n</td> <td>$-\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther than the reporting units with recent partial impairments noted in the table above, we have no other reporting units where we currently believe significant risk of impairment exists. Our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2017, resulted in cushion of 35% and 78% for International Lottery Systems and SG Gaming reporting units, respectively, for which we recorded impairment charges during years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (as disclosed in the table above).\nA substantial portion of our legacy U.K. Gaming reporting unit revenue is concentrated with LadbrokesCoral Group, which operates LBOs in the U.K. In October 2017, the U.K. government published its consultation on the review of stakes and prizes for all gaming terminals in the U.K. gaming sector. The consultation recommends a reduction in stakes on certain\ngaming machines. Although the consultation period closed in January 2018, any decision by the U.K. government was not enacted into law as of our goodwill impairment testing date nor as of December 31, 2017, and accordingly was not taken into consideration for related projections. The ultimate impact of a change in the allowed stakes on U.K. gaming machines was not determinable as of our goodwill impairment testing date.\nOur annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2017, which was based on laws and regulations enacted as of the testing date and objective factors including normalized historical results, resulted in a cushion of 85% for our legacy U.K. Gaming reporting unit. Although the estimated fair value of our legacy U.K. Gaming reporting unit was in excess of its respective carrying values, any enacted regulatory changes resulting in a significant reduction to allowable stakes could negatively impact our customers and our U.K. gaming business and could potentially result in an impairment of goodwill. As of December 31, 2017, our legacy U.K Gaming reporting unit carrying amount of goodwill was $184.8 million.\nGoodwill is reviewed for impairment using either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative one-step process (following our adoption of ASU 2016-18 in the first quarter of 2017). If we perform a qualitative assessment and determine that the fair value of a reporting unit more likely than not exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is necessary. For reporting units where we perform the quantitative process, we are required to compare the fair value of each reporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows, and a market approach to the respective carrying value, which includes goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying value is higher than the fair value, we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit's estimated fair value.\nDiscounted cash flow analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, the relative risk of achieving those cash flows, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. When using the market approach, we make judgments about the comparability of publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses or public transactions information for similar businesses. We base our judgments on factors such as size, growth rates, profitability, risk, and return on investment. We also make judgments when adjusting market multiples of revenue, and earnings for these companies to reflect their relative similarity to our business. Our analysis also includes comparison of our reporting units' total estimated fair values to the total enterprise value and assessing the implied control premium, supporting the reasonableness of our concluded estimated fair values determined under the combination of income and market approaches as of our testing date. Refer to Note 11 for key estimates and assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis for SG Gaming, U.S. Lottery Systems and International Lottery Systems reporting units in periods during which our impairment testing for these reporting units resulted in an impairment charge.\nWe test our indefinite-lived assets annually for impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived asset is less than its carrying value or when circumstances no longer continue to support an indefinite useful life. An impairment test may be qualitative or quantitative, depending on the circumstances. When a quantitative test is performed, a fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow approach where projections of future cash flows generated by those assets are discounted using an estimated discount rate. We estimate the fair value of our indefinite-lived assets using the relief-from-royalty method, which uses several significant assumptions, including an assumed royalty rate, revenue projections that consider both historical and estimated future results, general economic and market conditions, and the impact of planned business and operational strategies. If the indicated fair value of the indefinite-lived asset exceeds its carrying value, the asset is not considered impaired. In the event that the fair value of the indefinite-lived asset is less than its carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment charge.\nLong-lived assets and finite lived intangible assets\nWe evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets and other long-lived assets with finite useful lives by comparing the carrying value of the asset group to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows that we expect the asset to generate if events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets are not recoverable. Any impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value. The fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow approach where projections of future cash flows generated by those assets are discounted using an estimated discount rate. Significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows. We also make judgments about the remaining useful lives of intangible assets and other long-lived assets that have finite lives. While we believe our estimates of future operating results and projected cash flows are reasonable, any significant adverse changes in key assumptions (i.e., adverse change in the extent or manner which an asset (asset group) is being used or expectation that, more likely than not, an asset (asset group) will be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of its useful\nlife) or adverse changes in economic and market conditions may cause a change in our evaluation of recoverability or our estimation of fair value and could result in an impairment charge that could be material to our financial statements.\nAllowance for doubtful accounts - Notes receivable\nWe reserve an estimated amount for notes receivables that may not be collected to reduce our receivables to their net carrying value. Methodologies for estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts range from specific reserves to various percentages applied to aged receivables. Estimations of doubtful accounts are focused on receivables which are more than 90 days past due. We review a variety of relevant qualitative information such as collection experience, economic conditions and customer-specific financial conditions to evaluate credit risk in recording the allowance for doubtful accounts or as an indicator of an impaired loan. We also evaluate the macroeconomic and political environment of our customers to determine if these factors are an indication that a contractual obligation may be at risk to be collected in full. We may be required to make judgments related to the above factors if the information is not easily accessible. We may also have instances where we do not have an established history with a customer which also limits our ability to evaluate customer specific factors. Unexpected changes in the underlying financial condition of our customers or in the macroeconomic and political environment of a specific geographic region could result in a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position. As of December 31, 2017, a 10% increase or decrease to the allowance determined within notes receivable would change the reserve by approximately $2.1 million.\nIncome taxes\nWe are subject to the income tax laws of the many jurisdictions in which we operate. These tax laws are complex, and the manner in which they apply to our facts is sometimes open to interpretation. In establishing the provision for income taxes, we must make judgments about the application of these inherently complex tax laws.\nDespite our belief that our tax return positions are consistent with applicable tax laws, we believe that taxing authorities could challenge certain positions. Settlement of any challenge can result in no change, a complete disallowance, or some partial adjustment reached through negotiations or litigation. We record tax benefits for uncertain tax positions based upon management's evaluation of the information available at the reporting date. To be recognized in the financial statements, a tax benefit must be at least more likely than not of being sustained based on technical merits. The benefit for positions meeting the recognition threshold is measured as the largest benefit more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. Significant judgment is required in making these determinations and adjustments to uncertain tax positions may be necessary to reflect actual taxes payable upon settlement. Adjustments related to positions impacting the effective tax rate affect the provision for income taxes. Adjustments related to positions impacting the timing of deductions impact deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nOur income tax positions and analysis are based on currently enacted tax law. Future changes in tax law could significantly impact the provision for income taxes, the amount of taxes payable, and the deferred tax asset and liability balances in future periods. Deferred tax assets generally represent tax benefits for tax deductions or credits available in future tax returns. Certain estimates and assumptions are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making this assessment, management analyzes and estimates the impact of future taxable income, available carry-backs and carry-forwards, reversing temporary differences and available prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. We have recorded valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. Should a change in facts or circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the ultimate realizability of a deferred tax asset, we record or adjust the related valuation allowance in the annual period that the change in facts and circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding increase or decrease in the provision for income taxes.\nLegal contingencies\nWe are subject to certain legal proceedings, demands, claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business. We review the status of each significant matter quarterly and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability and an expense for the estimated loss. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the range of the loss can be reasonably estimated, then we disclose the range of the possible loss. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether a potential loss is probable, reasonably possible, or remote and in the determination of whether a potential exposure is reasonably estimable. Our accruals are based on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the liabilities and disclosures related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Potential legal liabilities and the revision of estimates of legal liabilities could have a material impact on\nour results of operations, cash flows and financial position. For discussion of the Company's legal proceedings, see Note 22, which is incorporated by reference into Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND WORKING CAPITAL\nSources of liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2017, our principal sources of liquidity, other than cash flows provided by operating activities, were cash and cash equivalents and amounts available under our revolving credit facility discussed below under \"Credit Agreement and Other Debt.\"\nSubsequent to December 31, 2017, we successfully completed a series of financing transactions, including a private offering of an additional $900.0 million principal amount of our 2025 Secured Notes, \u20ac325.0 million of 3.375% new senior secured notes due 2026 and \u20ac250 million of 5.500% new senior unsecured notes due 2026, and an amendment to our credit agreement to refinance our existing term loan B-4 facility and increase the term loans outstanding by $900.0 million under a new term loan B-5 facility (collectively referred to as the February 2018 Refinancing\u201d). We used a portion of the net proceeds of the February 2018 Refinancing to redeem $1,400.0 million of our outstanding 2022 Secured Notes, prepay a portion of our revolver borrowings under our credit agreement and pay accrued and unpaid interest thereon plus related premiums, fees and expenses. We intend to use the remaining net proceeds to redeem the remaining $700.0 million of our outstanding 2022 Secured Notes and pay accrued and unpaid interest thereon plus related premiums on or around March 2, 2018. In connection with the amendment to our credit agreement, the interest rate on our term loans was decreased from LIBOR plus 325 to LIBOR plus 275. We also increased the amount of the revolving credit agreement by $24.0 million to $620.2 million through October 18, 2018, with a step-down in availability at that time to $445.7 million until the extended maturity on October 18, 2020. As a result of these financing transactions, we have lowered our annual cash interest cost by approximately $69.0 million at current interest rates and extended the maturity of $2,100.0 million of our debt from 2022 out to 2024, 2025 and 2026.\nSubsequent to the February 2018 Refinancing and following our intended redemption of our outstanding 2022 Secured Notes (described above), the aggregate principal amount of debt outstanding would be approximately $9.0 billion, based on a Euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate of 1.2288 as of February 21, 2018.\nIn December 2017, we entered into a lender joinder agreement to our credit agreement with an additional revolving commitment lender. Pursuant to the joinder agreement, the amount of the revolving credit facility under the credit agreement was increased by $40.0 million.\nIn October 2017, we successfully completed a private offering of $350.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2025 Secured Notes (the \"October Financing\"). We used the net proceeds of this offering, together with cash on hand and borrowings under the revolving credit facility under our credit agreement, to finance the NYX acquisition, including the refinancing of certain indebtedness of NYX, and to pay related fees and expenses.\nDuring the third quarter of 2017, we completed a refinancing transaction (the August 2017 Refinancing\u201d), which included an amendment to our credit agreement, which further extended the maturity of our term loans and reduced the applicable interest rate on the term loans. The August 2017 Refinancing further lowered our annual cash interest cost and extended the maturity of approximately 40% of our debt from 2021 to 2024.\nDuring the first quarter of 2017, we completed a series of refinancing transactions (the \"February 2017 Refinancing\"), which included a private offering of $1.15 billion in aggregate principal amount of 2022 Secured Notes, and an amendment to our credit agreement, which extended the maturity of our term loans and revolving credit facility and reduced the applicable interest rate on the term loans. The February 2017 Refinancing reduced the total principal value of our debt by $45.0 million, including payment of the remaining $45.0 million on our revolving credit facility; lowered our annual cash interest cost; extended the maturity to 2021 and 2022 for approximately 95% of our debt and significantly reduced our exposure to floating interest rates.\nOn January 10, 2018, in connection with the reincorporation merger, the Surviving Corporation assumed all of the obligations of SGC under the credit agreement, the Senior Notes and the Subordinated Notes, and became a guarantor of all of that indebtedness.\nFor further information on the February 2018 Refinancing, February 2017 Refinancing, the August 2017 Refinancing, the October 2017 Financing, the 2025 Secured Notes and the joinder agreement, see Note 16.\nCash and available revolver capacity\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>788.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>115.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolver capacity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>596.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>592.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolver capacity drawn or committed to letters of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(375.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(76.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,009.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>631.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe amount of our available cash and cash equivalents fluctuates principally based on borrowings or repayments under our credit facilities, investments, acquisitions and changes in our working capital position. The borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility will depend on the amount of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit issued and on us remaining in compliance with the covenants under our credit agreement, including a maintenance covenant based on consolidated net first lien leverage. Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2017 included funds that were held to complete the NYX acquisition on January 5, 2018. We were in compliance with the covenants under our credit agreement as of December 31, 2017.\nWe believe that our cash flow from operations, available cash and cash equivalents and available borrowing capacity under our existing or anticipated financing arrangements will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future; however, we cannot assure that this will be the case. We believe that substantially all cash held outside the U.S. is free from legal encumbrances or similar restrictions that would prevent it from being available to meet our global liquidity needs.\nTotal cash held by our foreign subsidiaries was $57.6 million as of December 31, 2017.\nOur Gaming operations and Lottery systems businesses generally require significant upfront capital expenditures. In connection with a renewal or bid of a Gaming operations or Lottery systems contract, a customer may seek to obtain new equipment or impose new service requirements, which may require additional capital expenditures in order to retain or win the contract. Our ability to generate revenue and to continue to procure new contracts will depend on, among other things, our then present liquidity levels or our ability to obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms. If we do not have adequate liquidity or are unable to obtain financing for these upfront cash payments on favorable terms or at all, we may not be able to bid on certain contracts, which could restrict our ability to grow and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and other obligations depends on our ability to generate cash in the future. We may also, from time to time, repurchase, or otherwise retire or refinance our debt, through our subsidiaries or otherwise. Such activities, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, contractual restrictions and other factors, and the amounts involved may or may not be material. If we need to refinance all or part of our indebtedness at or before maturity, we cannot assure that we will be able to obtain new financing or to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In the event we pursue significant acquisitions or other expansion opportunities, conduct significant repurchases of our outstanding securities, or refinance or repay existing debt, we may need to raise additional capital either through the public or private issuance of equity or debt securities or through additional borrowings under our existing financing arrangements, which sources of funds may not necessarily be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nIn addition, U.S. lottery customers generally require service providers to provide performance bonds in connection with the relevant contract. As of December 31, 2017, our outstanding performance bonds totaled $230.7 million. Our ability to obtain performance bonds on commercially reasonable terms is subject to our financial condition and to prevailing market conditions, which may be impacted by economic and political events. Although we have not experienced difficulty in obtaining such bonds to date, we cannot assure that we will continue to be able to obtain performance bonds on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nAs a result of the LNS concession renewal, described in Note 13, we are responsible for our pro rata share of the total \u20ac800 million payment required to be made by LNS to retain the lottery concession, which is \u20ac160.0 million. We funded \u20ac10 million of our share during the fourth quarter of 2017, with the remainder to be funded in April and October of 2018 in the amount of \u20ac60 million and \u20ac90 million, respectively. Contributions to LNS are expected to be funded out of existing cash and additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\nCash Flow Summary\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs. 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>507.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>419.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>414.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(414.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(228.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(269.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(186.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>580.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(196.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(183.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>776.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>677.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(49.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>687.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nCash flows from operating activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the prior year period increased primarily due to a $174.5 million increase in incremental net earnings after reconciling adjustments and changes in deferred taxes, partially offset by changes in working capital accounts as the prior year benefited from the timing of receivable collections and cash disbursements coupled with various other changes in our working capital accounts. The changes in our working capital accounts during the year ended December 31, 2017 were primarily driven by the following:\n \u2022 $48.0 million increase in accounts and notes receivable due to strong sales during the year; \n \u2022 $2.2 million increase in inventories primarily due to the timing of orders and deployment of units in our Gaming segment; and \n \u2022 $28.6 million positive net impact on cash flows from changes in other current assets and liabilities as a result of the timing of expenditures and interest payments.  In April 2017, we entered into a settlement and seven-year patent cross-license agreement with another party that resolved outstanding intellectual property matters between the two companies. As part of this agreement, we received a $20.0 million advance royalty payment.\nCash flows from investing activities\nNet cash used in investing activities increased primarily due to the business acquisitions described in Note 9, the November 2017 acquisition of 36% of the outstanding ordinary shares and other securities of NYX for $91.9 million described in Note 13 and $20.8 million in higher capital expenditures, primarily associated with our recently launched WAP and other participation units. Capital expenditures are composed of investments in systems, equipment and other assets related to contracts, property and equipment, intangible assets and software.\nCash flows from financing activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased primarily due to the February 2017 Refinancing, August 2017 Refinancing and October 2017 Financing transactions described in Note 16 and revolving credit facility borrowings in anticipation of closing the NYX acquisition on January 5, 2018, combined with lower principal payments on the long-term debt during the period. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we also incurred $58.7 million in debt issuance and deferred financing costs.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nCash flows from operating activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $4.8 million over the prior year. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the incremental net earnings, net of non-cash items of $97.3 million and a $92.5 million decrease in working capital and other items.\nCash flows from investing activities\nThe decrease in net cash used in investing activities of $32.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily reflected (1) a decrease of $13.4 million in distributions of capital on equity investments; (2) a decrease of capital expenditures of $50.7 million; (3) an incremental change in restricted cash of $9.6 million; and (4) an increase in proceeds from asset sales\nof $10.0 million compared to 2015. Capital expenditures are composed of investments in systems, equipment and other assets related to contracts, property and equipment, intangible assets and software.\nCash flows from financing activities\nThe increase in net cash used in financing activities of $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to: (1) an increase in the payments on license obligations of $9.7 million; and, (2) an increase in the net redemptions of Class A common stock under stock-based compensation plans of $5.2 million, partially offset by (3) a decrease in net payments of long-term debt of $1.6 million.\nCredit Agreement and Other Debt\nFor additional information regarding our credit agreement and other debt, interest rate risk and interest rate hedging instruments, see \"Contractual Obligations\" in this Item 7 below, and in Part II,", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7.

Our portfolio includes gaming machines and game content, casino management systems, table game products and services, instant and draw-based lottery games, lottery systems, lottery content and services, interactive gaming and social casino solutions and other products and services. We also gain access to technologies and pursue global expansion through strategic acquisitions and equity investments.\nSGC was incorporated in the state of Delaware on July 2, 1984. On September 18, 2017, SGC entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with SG Nevada Merger Company, a Nevada corporation and SGC's wholly owned subsidiary Newco, providing for the merger of SGC with and into Newco with Newco surviving the merger, for the sole purpose of changing SGC's state of incorporation from Delaware to Nevada. Refer to Part I, Item 1 for additional details.\nHighlights, including recent developments:\nMergers and Acquisitions\n \u2022 In January 2018, we successfully completed the NYX acquisition, for an aggregate enterprise value of approximately $640.0 million. \n \u2022 During 2017, we also completed four smaller acquisitions, including Spricerack Media, Inc. and DEQ, which were accretive to our financial performance and expanded our portfolio of products.  Financings\n \u2022 Subsequent to December 31, 2017, we successfully completed a series of financing transactions, including a private offering of an additional $900.0 million principal amount of our 2025 Secured Notes, \u20ac325.0 million of 3.375% new senior secured notes due 2026 and \u20ac250 million of 5.500% new senior unsecured notes due 2026, and an amendment to our credit agreement to refinance our existing term loan B-4 facility and increase the term loans outstanding by $900.0 million under a new term loan B-5 facility. \n \u25e6 We used a portion of the net proceeds of these financing transactions to redeem $1,400.0 million of our outstanding 2022 Secured Notes, prepay a portion of our revolver borrowings under our credit agreement and pay accrued and unpaid interest thereon plus related premiums, fees and expenses. \n \u25e6 We intend to use the remaining net proceeds to redeem the remaining $700.0 million of our outstanding 2022 Secured Notes and pay accrued and unpaid interest thereon plus related premiums on or around March 2, 2018. \n \u25e6 In connection with the amendment to our credit agreement, the interest rate on our term loan was decreased from LIBOR plus 325 to LIBOR plus 275. \n \u25e6 We increased the amount of the revolving credit agreement by $24.0 million to $620.2 million through October 18, 2018, with a step-down in availability at that time to $445.7 million until the extended maturity on October 18, 2020. \n \u25e6 As a result of these financing transactions, we have lowered our annual cash interest cost by approximately $69.0 million at current interest rates and extended the maturity of $2,100.0 million of our debt from 2022 out to 2024, 2025 and 2026. \n \u2022 On January 10, 2018, in connection with the reincorporation merger, the Surviving Corporation assumed all of the obligations of SGC under the credit agreement, the Senior Notes and the Subordinated Notes, and became a guarantor of all of that indebtedness. \n \u2022 During 2017, we successfully completed a series of refinancing transactions, including a private offering of $1.15 billion in aggregate principal amount of 2022 Secured Notes and amendments to our credit agreement that extended the maturity of our term loans and revolving credit facility and reduced the applicable interest rate on the term loans. These actions reduced the total principal amount of our debt by $45.0 million, including payment of the remaining $45.0 million on our revolving credit facility, lowered our annual cash interest cost and significantly reduced our exposure to floating interest rates. \n \u2022 In March 2017, we redeemed all $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 2018 Notes. \n \u2022 In October 2017, we successfully completed the initial offering of our 2025 Secured Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $350.0 million.  Expanding our Customer Base\n \u2022 In December 2017, LNS accepted a contract extension of up to nine years for the Italian Scratch and Win concession. \n \u2022 In July 2017, we were awarded a new, six-year contract as the primary instant games provider for the Colorado Lottery. \n \u2022 In June 2017, we were awarded a new, four-year contract to provide instant games and additional services to the New Hampshire Lottery. \n \u2022 In June 2017, we were awarded a new, eight-year systems technology and services contract from the Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Agency. \nTrends and Uncertainties\nWe continue to experience challenges that are representative of trends and uncertainties that may affect our business and results of operations. We are a highly leveraged company which presents several challenges, including the dedication of a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to service interest and principal payments on our indebtedness. Additional challenges we face relate to expanding our footprint within international markets and the related process of obtaining regulatory approvals to provide services and products within these new and emerging markets. A third set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape. Our major competitors are expanding their product and service offerings with integrated products and solutions. We are also faced with challenges related to foreign currency risk. Our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses.\nReportable Segments\nThe segment amounts included in MD&A are presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting as of December 31, 2017. Segment information appearing in Note 2 is also presented on this basis. At the end of fiscal 2017, we had three business segments for financial reporting purposes - Gaming, Lottery and Interactive.\nAs a result of the NYX acquisition (see Note 9) and starting with the first quarter 2018 reporting period, we will report our operations in four business segments, representing our different products and services: Gaming, Lottery, Social and Digital.\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS\n\nRevenue \nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nGaming revenue increased in 2017, primarily due to higher gaming machine sales, placement of table products and hardware sales partially offset by a decrease in WAP and premium game revenue. The gaming revenue increase included the unfavorable impact of $1.6 million from foreign currency.\nLottery revenue increased in 2017, primarily due to higher revenues from our participation and PPU contracts, launching of WILLY WONKA GOLDEN TICKET\u2122 multi-state instant game and higher international terminal and software sales. Lottery increases included the unfavorable foreign currency impact of $1.6 million.\nInteractive revenue increased in 2017, primarily due to 32% growth in our social gaming B2C business reflecting the ongoing popularity of Jackpot Party\u00ae Social Casino and the success of more recent apps, such as the introduction of the 88 Fortunes\u00ae app in the first quarter of 2017, combined with the acquisition of Spicerack, which closed in April 2017, and its Bingo Showdown social gaming app.\nOperating expenses\n\n(1) Exclusive of D&A.\nCost of revenue\nConsolidated cost of revenue increased by $58.3 million in 2017, including (1) a $40.6 million higher cost of Interactive services primarily related to platform fees associated with the $87.6 million increase in Interactive social revenue; (2) a $11.4 million increase in Lottery cost of product sales driven primarily by increased terminal and software sales; and (3) a $29.3 million increase in Gaming cost of product sales driven by increased gaming machine and hardware sales; partially offset by $20.4 million decrease in gaming cost of services reflecting lower gaming operations revenue and lower third party royalty costs.\nSG&A\nThe increase in SG&A of $36.1 million in 2017 was primarily due to the following: (1) an increase in Interactive SG&A of $25.0 million, primarily driven by additional marketing spend and user acquisition costs related to our growing portfolio of social and mobile gaming apps; (2) a $24.7 million increase in salaries and benefits primarily reflecting higher incentive compensation commensurate with the Company's overall performance and to the lesser extent increased headcount; and (3) a $24.1 million increase in professional and legal fees. This increase was partially offset by benefits realized in the current year from the November 2016 business improvement initiative. The prior year also included $7.5 million of insurance proceeds recorded during the second quarter of 2016 in connection with a settlement of a legal matter.\nR&D\nThe decrease in R&D was primarily driven by reduced spending on outside resources for certain projects and headcount reduction completed as a part of the November 2016 business improvement initiative.\nDepreciation, amortization and impairments\nD&A decreased by $55.9 million in 2017 primarily due to certain acquired intangible assets from the 2013 WMS acquisition and 2014 Bally acquisition becoming fully depreciated in the third quarter of 2016, and acquired Gaming assets for which accelerated depreciation was recorded in the prior comparable period.\nGoodwill impairments\nDuring 2016, we recorded an impairment charge of $69.0 million to reduce the carrying value of our International Lottery Systems reporting unit's goodwill balance to its implied fair value. See Note 11 for additional information.\nRestructuring and other\nRestructuring and other costs decreased $11.1 million in 2017, primarily associated with costs incurred in 2016 related to the November 2016 business improvement initiative partially offset by acquisition-related costs associated with NYX acquisition. See Note 4 for additional information.\nOther Factors Affecting 2017, 2016 and 2015 Net Loss Comparability \n(1) For additional information regarding the changes in our effective tax rates and the variance in our income tax (expense) benefit and impact of Tax Reform, see Note 21.\nForeign exchange (F/X)\nOur results are impacted by changes in F/X rates used in the translation of foreign functional currencies into USD and the re-measurement of foreign currency transactions or balances. The impact of F/X rate fluctuations represents the difference between current rates and prior-period rates applied to current activity. Our exposure to foreign currency volatility on revenue is as follows:\n\n(1) Our earnings from our Euro-denominated equity investment in LNS were $14.3 million, $14.0 million and $14.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nSee \"Business Segment Results\u201d below for a more detailed explanation of the significant changes in our components of revenue and expenses within the individual segment results of operations.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nRevenue\nGaming revenue slightly decreased in 2016, primarily due to a decrease in WAP and premium game revenue and lower systems hardware and software sales, which was offset by higher gaming machine sales. The gaming revenue decrease included the negative impact of $22.4 million from foreign currency.\nLottery revenue increased in 2016 primarily due to higher U.S revenue, mostly driven by an increase in U.S. instant game sales revenue with particular strength in Participation contracts and from CSP customers for whom we provide our integrated CSP offerings and increased retail sales of multi-state games including sales leading up to the record $1.6 billion POWERBALL jackpot in January 2016. These increases were offset by an unfavorable $21.7 million impact from the expiration of the CSL validation contract in January 2016 and a negative $9.1 million impact from foreign currency.\nInteractive revenue increased in 2016 primarily due to 60.8% growth in our social gaming B2C business reflecting the ongoing popularity of Jackpot Party Social Casino and the success of our recently launched Quick Hit\u00ae Slots, Hot Shot Casino\u00ae and Blazing 7s Slots\u2122 social gaming apps.\nCost of revenue\nConsolidated cost of revenue increased by $2.2 million in 2016, including (1) a $26.7 million increase in cost of unit shipments in Gaming resulting from the introduction of the TwinStar\u00ae Dual-Screen and TwinStar J43\u2122 Video gaming machines which generally carry higher costs at launch and trend lower as they mature; (2) a $48.9 million increase in the cost of Interactive services primarily related to volume-driven increase in the third-party platform fees on the $122.8 million increase in Interactive revenues, which was offset by; (3) a decrease of $25.1 million in gaming costs primarily associated with placement of WAP, premium and other leased machines as operators have removed more of these machines from their gaming floors; (4) an $11.0 million decrease in costs related to systems and hardware sales; and (5) a $40.7 million reduction in cost of instant games primarily due to the cancellation of the MONOPOLYTM MILLIONAIRES' CLUB (MMC) game.\nSG&A\nThe increase in SG&A of $9.3 million in 2016 was primarily due to the following: (1) a $34.9 million increase in marketing primarily driven by Interactive marketing and player acquisition costs related to new games launched in 2016 and the increased marketing related to our Jackpot Party Social Casino app; (2) a $9.9 million increase in stock-based compensation, primarily attributable to the accelerated recognition of certain stock based compensation, which was offset by; (3) a $15.4 million decrease in salaries and benefits resulting from headcount actions; and (4) a $21.2 million decrease in professional and legal fees, which includes a $7.5 million credit related to insurance proceeds received during the second quarter of 2016 in connection with the settlement of a legal matter.\nR&D\nR&D increased by $20.9 million in 2016, primarily driven by higher investments in new product and app development across each of our business segments.\nDepreciation, amortization and impairments\nD&A decreased by $164.5 million in 2016 and was primarily due to the following: (1) the non-recurrence of $128.6 million of intangible asset impairment charges recognized in 2015 which reduced the carrying value of two trade name assets to their fair value; (2) the impact from the expiration of the CSL validation contract in January 2016; and (3) an $11.9 million impairment of the MMC game studio recognized in 2015 which did not recur in 2016.\nGoodwill impairments\nDuring 2016, we recorded an impairment charge of $69.0 million to reduce the carrying value of our International Lottery Systems reporting unit's goodwill balance to its implied fair value. During 2015, we recorded an aggregate goodwill impairment charges of $1,002.6 million to reduce the carrying value of our SG Gaming and U.S. Lottery Systems reporting units' goodwill balances to their implied fair value. See Note 11 for additional information.\nRestructuring and other\nRestructuring and other costs increased $35.1 million in 2016 primarily associated with the business improvement initiative which was announced on November 3, 2016. See Note 4 for additional information.\nBUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS\nThe types of products and services from which our segments derive their revenues are further discussed in Notes 2 and 3. Certain financial information relating to our segments, including segment revenue, operating income (loss) and total assets for the last three fiscal years and certain financial information relating to our revenue derived from and assets located in the U.S. and other geographic areas is included in Note 2.\nGAMING\nOur Gaming business segment designs, develops, manufactures, markets and distributes a comprehensive portfolio of gaming products and services. We provide our Gaming portfolio of products and services to commercial casinos, Native American casinos, wide-area gaming operators such as LBOs, arcade and bingo operators in the U.K. and continental Europe, and government agencies and their affiliated operators. Our equity investments in RCN and International Terminal Leasing are part of our Gaming business segment.\nThe following table summarizes the primary business activities included in our Gaming business segment.\n\nGaming Operations\nOur services revenue includes revenue earned from Participation games, other gaming machine services and table product service arrangements and licensing. We categorize our Participation gaming machines as (1) WAP, premium and daily fee Participation games and (2) other leased and Participation games.\nWAP, premium and daily fee Participation games\n \u2022 WAP Participation games: WAP Participation games are electronically linked gaming machines that are located across multiple casinos within a single gaming jurisdiction or across Native American gaming jurisdictions. Players across linked gaming machines contribute to and compete for system-wide progressive jackpots that are designed to increase gaming machine play for participating casinos by giving the players the opportunity to win a larger jackpot than on a non-WAP gaming machine. We are responsible for funding WAP jackpots. We create WAP games using our proprietary brands and also using licensed brands. We operate our WAP systems in six states throughout the U.S. and in certain Native American casinos.  Premium and daily fee Participation games: We offer two categories of non-WAP premium and daily fee Participation games: LAP and standalone. LAP games are gaming machines that are located within a single casino and are electronically linked to a progressive jackpot for that specific casino. Our LAP gaming machines feature games including those offered as WAP and our proprietary brands such as Jackpot Party Progressive\u00ae, Life of Luxury\u00ae Progressive, 88 Fortunes, 5 Treasures\u00ae, and Cash Spin. Our LAP products leverage both exclusive brand names and game play intellectual property, and typically offer players the chance to win multiple progressive jackpots, all of which tend to result in higher play volumes. We also provide certain standalone Participation games that are not linked to other gaming machines. Our standalone games feature titles under licensed brands and our\nproprietary brands. Our standalone Participation gaming machines generally feature larger, more elaborate top-boxes and provide game play experiences not possible on a single screen game or on gaming machines that we sell.\nOther leased and Participation games\n \u2022 Server-based gaming: We provide wide-area gaming operators, such as LBOs, bingo halls and arcades, a comprehensive package of server-based products and services under long term contracts that typically include gaming machines, remote management of game content and management information, central computer systems, secure data communication and field support services. We are typically paid a fee based on the Net win generated by these gaming machines (subject to certain adjustments as may be specified in a particular contract, including adjustments for taxes and other fees). Our business in this category is primarily based in the U.K. \n \u2022 VLTs: For certain customers, we provide our multi-game and single-game VLTs, which include video gaming machines, mechanical reel gaming machines and video poker games. Our VLTs may be operated as standalone units or may interface with central monitoring systems operated by government agencies. Our VLTs are typically located in places where casino-style gaming is not the only attraction, such as racetracks, bars and restaurants. \n \u2022 Class II and centrally determined systems: We offer video and mechanical-reel gaming machines and VLTs for Class II and certain VLT jurisdictions where the game outcome is determined by a central server system that we provide. These Class II and centrally determined systems primarily operate in Native American casinos in Washington, Florida, Alabama and Oklahoma. We receive either a fixed daily fee or a percentage of the Net win generated by the gaming machines or VLTs connected to the central determination system and a small daily fee for the central determination system.  Gaming Machine Sales\nThe majority of our product sales are derived from sales of gaming machines and VLTs that use a combination of advanced graphics, mechanical reels, digital music and sounds and secondary bonus games. We also sell ETSs to either meet the needs of particular locations where live tables are not allowed or as productivity-enhancing solutions for other jurisdictions.\nGaming Systems\nOur comprehensive suite of technology solutions provides gaming operations of every size with a wide range of marketing, data management and analysis, accounting, player tracking, security and other applications and tools to more effectively manage their operations. Gaming systems products include the iVIEW\u00ae touch screen display, which facilitates the player experience, bonus features, customer service, and employee functions. Gaming systems revenues related to core system solutions are highly dependent on new installations. Gaming system revenues are also generated through ongoing hardware and software maintenance services and upgrades.\nTable Products\nOur table product sales are generated primarily from the sale of products designed to enhance table game speed, productivity, profitability and security. Our product offerings include various models of Shufflers to suit specific games.\nWe offer Shuffler products under month-to-month arrangements that contain Participation rates or fixed monthly rates. These arrangements include service of the product with back-up and replacement products available at the customer's request.\nWe license our PTG content to commercial, tribal and governmental casino operators typically under month to month arrangements based on fixed monthly rates. PTGs which are designed to enhance operators' table-game operations, include our internally developed and acquired PTGs, side bets, add-ons and progressive features. Our proprietary content and features are also added to public domain games such as poker, baccarat, pai gow poker, craps and blackjack table games and to electronic platforms.\nRevenues from our Gaming products and services to external customers accounted for 60%, 61% and 64% of our total revenues in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nCurrent year update\nDespite strong gaming machine sales during 2017, we believe the market for gaming machine sales was challenging during 2017 and could remain challenging in the near term. These challenges included: (1) restrained investment in new replacement gaming machines by our existing customers; (2) increased competition for new systems, gaming operations, gaming machines and table products businesses; and (3) other economic and regulatory pressures that affect our business operations globally.\nFor 2018, we expect to continue to face pricing pressure in our Gaming segment. We anticipate that replacement demand for gaming machines and constraints on capital spending by gaming operators will continue at current levels. We anticipate that demand for our gaming systems products and services could increase due to several Canadian contracts and related new system implementations during 2018; however, timing can fluctuate based on actual installations of the solutions. We believe we have begun to stabilize the erosion in the installed base of WAP, premium and daily-fee Participation gaming machines. In 2017, we demonstrated a significant breadth and depth of innovative new products that we expect to launch in the year ahead to support our target of growing the overall category. These products were headlined by three JAMES BOND themed games showcased on our new Gamefield 2.0TM and TwinStar J43 iReels cabinets.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, our contracts with two of the large U.K. bookmakers represented a significant portion of our U.K. LBO server-based gaming business. Our current contract with Ladbrokes plc ( Ladbrokes\u201d) commenced on October 22, 2013 and is scheduled to expire on March 31, 2019. Our current contract with Gala Coral Group Ltd. ( Gala Coral\u201d) commenced on January 1, 2010 and expired on December 31, 2017, with the parties continuing to operating under the current contract terms and conditions, until ongoing negotiations (described below) are concluded. In October 2016, Ladbrokes and Gala Coral merged. We are currently in negotiation with LadbrokesCoral Group about a new contract for the merged entity, with negotiation expected to be completed in 2018.\nResults of Operations and Key Performance Indicators\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nRevenue \nGaming Operations\nGaming operations revenue decreased in 2017 in part due to: (1) a 823 unit decrease in the installed base of WAP, premium and daily-fee Participation gaming machines; (2) a decrease in the average daily revenue per WAP, premium and daily-fee Participation units primarily reflecting a lower mix of high-yielding WAP games; and (3) a decrease in the average daily revenue per Other Participation and leased units, which was partially offset by a 785 unit increase in installed base of other participation and leased units.\nGaming Machine Sales\nGaming machine unit sales increased due to higher unit shipments primarily resulting from sales and strong performance of the TwinStar family of gaming machines, along with continued strong sales of the Pro Wave\u00ae cabinet.\nU.S. and Canadian shipments encompassed 15,015 replacement units, including 250 Oregon VLT units (which completed the contract), and 5,466 units for new casino openings and expansions, including 2,469 Illinois VGT units. International shipments encompassed 12,308 replacement units and 949 units for new casino openings and expansions. The average sales price increased to $17,231 per unit reflecting a greater mix of higher-priced premium gaming machines sold during the period.\nGaming Systems\nGaming systems sales increased in 2017 due to increased hardware sales, driven by placements of the iView 4 hardware products, with significant sales to Tribal gaming customers, coupled with the new gaming system implementations in the province of Alberta.\nTable Products\nTable products revenue increased in 2017 primarily due to increased Shuffler sales, table product placements and the impact of the acquisition of DEQ Systems Corp., which closed in January 2017.\nOperating income\nThe increase in operating income in 2017 was primarily attributable to the following: (1) higher overall gaming revenues as described above; (2) a decrease in overall operating expenses primarily due to the November 2016 business improvement initiative; (3) lower D&A of $64.4 million for the period due to certain acquired intangible assets becoming fully amortized in the third quarter of 2016, and acquired Gaming assets for which accelerated depreciation was recorded in the prior comparable period; and (4) a more profitable revenue mix, which was primarily due to an increase in Gaming systems sales.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nGaming Operations\nGaming operations revenue decreased in 2016 in part due to: (1) a 787 unit decrease in the installed base of WAP, premium and daily-fee Participation gaming machines; (2) a decrease in the average daily revenue per WAP, premium and daily-fee Participation units primarily reflecting a lower mix of high-yielding WAP games; (3) a 475 unit decrease in the ending installed base for Other Participation and leased units; and (4) a decrease in the average daily revenue per Other Participation and leased units. As a result of the third quarter release of our GameScape\u2122 cabinet, our WAP installed base at the end of the fourth quarter of 2016 was up approximately 1% on a sequential quarter basis.\nGaming Machine Sales\nGaming machine unit sales increased due to higher global unit shipments primarily resulting from sales of the Pro Series WAVE (released in 2014), and the TwinStar and Dualos cabinets, both released in 2015.\nU.S. and Canadian shipments encompassed 13,969 replacement units, including 1,271 Oregon VLT units (which completed the shipment under the related contract), and 4,211 units for new casino openings and expansions, including 1,700 Illinois VGT units. International shipments encompassed 11,956 replacement units and 1,474 units for new casino openings and expansions. The average sales price increased to $16,647 per unit, reflecting a greater mix of higher-performing premium gaming machines sold during the period.\nGaming Systems\nGaming systems sales decreased in 2016 due to lower hardware, software and services sales resulting from fewer large, multi-site opportunities, system replacements and new casino openings in 2016. The decreases were partially offset by a 5% increase in systems maintenance revenue.\nTable Products\nTable products revenue increased due to increased Shuffler sales driven by sales into Asian markets and a 5% increase in revenue from leased Shufflers, PTGs and progressives primarily due to the success of the Blazing 7s BlackjackTM Progressive.\nOperating income\nThe increase in operating income was primarily attributable to the following: (1) the non-recurrence of a 2015 goodwill impairment charge; (2) a decrease in overall operating expenses primarily due to realized integration cost synergies largely implemented in prior periods, including lower SG&A expense of $37.1 million for the year which benefited from $7.5 million of insurance proceeds received in connection with the settlement of a legal matter; and (3) lower D&A expense of $143.3 million, driven by the non-recurrence of 2015 intangible asset impairments which totaled $128.6 million; partially offset by (4) a less profitable revenue mix, which was due to an increase in lower-margin Gaming machine sales revenue and a decline in higher-margin Gaming systems and Gaming operations revenue.\nLOTTERY\nThe Lottery segment is primarily comprised of our systems-based services and product sales business and our instant games business. Our systems-based services and product sales business provides customized computer software, software support, equipment and data communication services, sports wagering systems and keno to lotteries. In the U.S., we typically provide the\nnecessary POS terminals and equipment, software and maintenance services on a Participation basis under long-term contracts that typically have an initial term of at least five years. Internationally, we typically sell POS terminals and/or computer software to lottery authorities and may provide ongoing fee-based systems maintenance and software support services.\nOur instant games business generates revenue from the manufacture and sale of instant games, and the provision of value-added services such as game design, sales and marketing support, specialty games and promotions, inventory management, warehousing, fulfillment services, and full instant game category management. In addition, we provide licensed games, promotional entertainment and internet-based marketing services to the lottery industry. These revenues are presented as instant games revenue.\nOur equity investments in LNS, Northstar Illinois, Northstar New Jersey, CSG, Hellenic Lotteries and GLB are included in the Lottery segment.\nThe following table summarizes the primary business activities included in the Lottery business segment.\n\n(1) See Instant Lottery Games below.\nInstant Lottery Games\nWe generate revenue from the sale of instant lottery games. Some of our contracts bundle the design and manufacturing of instant lottery games, instant game management systems and marketing and other services, such as the design and installation of game management software, inventory and distribution, sales, accounting, training and advisory services, market research and retailer training and recruitment. We are typically paid on a Participation basis under these contracts. We believe these services help lotteries effectively manage and support their operations, achieve higher retail sales and lower operating costs. We also provide licensed games and promotional and interactive marketing services to the lottery industry.\nWe market instant lottery games and related services to U.S. and international lotteries and commercial customers. We supply instant lottery games to 39 of the 44 U.S. jurisdictions that sell instant lottery games and have sold instant lottery games to customers in approximately 50 countries. Our U.S. instant lottery game contracts customarily have an initial term of three to five years and frequently include multiple renewal options for additional periods ranging from one to five years, which our customers have generally exercised in the past. We usually sell our instant lottery games on a PPU (meaning instant games sold to customer at a fixed price per unit) or Participation basis. Certain of our international customers purchase instant lottery games as needed rather than under multi-game supply contracts.\nWe provide lotteries with access to some of the world's most popular entertainment brands on lottery products, which we believe helps increase our customers' instant game sales. Our licensed entertainment brands include AMC\u00ae THE WALKING DEAD\u00ae, HARLEY-DAVIDSON\u00ae, LOTERIATM, MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL\u00ae, MARGARITAVILLE\u00ae, MONOPOLY, NATIONAL BASKETBALL ASSOCIATION, THE PRICE IS RIGHT\u00ae and SLINGO\u00ae. We also provide branded merchandise, advertising, promotional support, drawing management services and prize fulfillment programs. In addition, we offer lotteries interactive\nmarketing services through our Loyalty Plus program which features players clubs, reward programs, second chance promotional websites, interactive games and subscription systems that enable players to purchase lottery games securely over the internet.\nLottery Systems\nWe are a leading provider of lottery systems including customized computer software, software support, equipment, and data communication services, to lotteries world-wide. Our U.S. arrangements ordinarily include the following: (1) provision of the necessary equipment (including POS terminals) and (2) software and maintenance services pursuant to long-term contracts that typically have an initial term of at least five years under which we are generally paid a fee equal to a percentage of the lottery's total retail sales. Our U.S. contracts commonly include multiple renewal options that generally have been exercised by our customers in the past. Internationally, we primarily sell: (1) POS terminals and/or computer software and hardware to lottery authorities; and (2) provide ongoing fee-based systems and software support services.\nOur lottery systems use proprietary technology that facilitates high-speed processing of draw lottery game wagers and validation of winning draw and instant lottery games. This business includes the supply of proprietary transaction-processing software, draw lottery games, keno, point-of-sale terminals, central site computers and communication platforms and ongoing operational support and maintenance services. We have contracts to operate lottery systems for 10 of the 46 U.S. jurisdictions that operate draw lotteries. Internationally, we have lottery systems operating in 14 countries including Canada and China.\nThe fees we earn under our lottery systems contracts are generally included in our services revenue. Revenue from the sale of our POS terminals and/or computer software is included in our product sales revenue, while the fees we generate from ongoing systems and software support are generally included in our services revenue.\nWe have equity investments in LNS, Northstar New Jersey, Hellenic Lotteries, CSG and GLB, which entities operate or assist in the operation of lotteries. We are also the primary provider of instant lottery games to LNS and Northstar New Jersey and the exclusive provider of instant lottery games to Camelot Illinois, LLC and Hellenic Lotteries. Additional information regarding these equity investments is included in Note 13.\nRevenues from our Lottery products and services to external customers accounted for 26%, 27% and 28% of our total revenues in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nCurrent year update\nWe believe we will continue to face intense price-based competition in our Lottery business in 2018. In the near term, we also expect to see an increase in the number of jurisdictions that seek to privatize or outsource lottery operations and to face strong competition from both traditional and new competitors with respect to these opportunities. In addition, we anticipate that lottery RFPs, specifically those for PMA arrangements and certain of our international customers, could increasingly include terms that expose us to increased risk, such as requiring the guarantee of specific income thresholds or significant upfront payments. Also, the renewal of the LNS concession for up to nine years will result in the continuation of our instant lottery games supply agreement for the term of the renewal, under which we are the primary provider of instant lottery games to LNS.\nResults of Operations and Key Performance Indicators\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nRevenue\n\nnm = not meaningful\npp = percentage points\n(1) Information provided by third-party lottery operators.\n(2) U.S. instant games customers' retail sales include only sales of instant games.\n(3) U.S. lottery systems customers' retail sales primarily include sales of draw games, keno and instant games validated by the relevant system.\n(4) Retail sales may not have a direct correlation to our revenue due to terms of our contracts, the impact of changes in our contracts or other factors.\nPrimary factors affecting total higher Lottery revenue in 2017 were: (1) a $14.3 million increase in instant product revenues driven by higher revenues in Participation and PPU contracts coupled with launching of WILLY WONKA GOLDEN TICKET\u2122 multi-state instant licensed game; and (2) a $19.3 million increase in lottery systems revenues for the period driven by higher domestic and international terminal and software sales. Lottery revenues included unfavorable foreign currency impact on revenue (primarily in the U.K.) totaling $1.6 million for year ended December 31, 2017.\nOperating income\nOperating income increased in 2017 primarily due to a more profitable revenue mix and the following key factors: (1) a decrease in D&A totaling $16.4 million driven by certain Lottery systems equipment becoming fully depreciated during 2016 and write-off of equipment associated with a cancelled contract in 2016; and (2) a decrease in SG&A of $6.3 million primarily due to the November 2016 business improvement initiative. The year ended December 31, 2016 also included a $69.0 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge.\nEarnings from equity investments\nThe increase in earnings from equity investments of $13.7 million was primarily due to an $11.3 million impairment charge recorded during the year ended December 31, 2016 related to an equity investment in China.\nAs a result of the LNS concession renewal described above and in Note 13, LNS is required to pay \u20ac800 million in upfront fees. The upfront fees will be amortized by LNS (anticipated to be approximately \u20ac89 million each year on a pre-tax basis and commencing in September 2019), which will reduce our equity in earnings of LNS. Our share of the amortization expense is expected to be approximately \u20ac18 million each year on a pre-tax basis.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nRevenue\nPrimary factors affecting the slight increase in total Lottery revenue in 2016 were: (1) continued strength in Participation and PPU contracts (especially with customers having a CSP contract) which increased instant games revenue by $27.4 million; and (2) U.S. revenue from retail sales of multi-state games which increased total revenue by $6.6 million, which were partially offset by; (3) the expiration of the CSL validation contract which had a negative $21.7 million impact on services revenue; (4) an\nunfavorable impact on revenue from foreign currency (primarily in the U.K.) totaling $9.1 million; and (5) a decrease of $2.7 million in other product sales revenues.\nOperating income\nOperating income increased primarily due to: (1) a more profitable revenue mix and the non-recurrence of a $35.5 million charge related to other asset impairments and certain cancellation costs of MMC included in cost of instant games sales in 2015, which reduced cost of sales by $42.0 million; and (2) a decrease in D&A totaling $29.5 million. The decreases in cost of sales and D&A are primarily attributable to the cancellation of the MONOPOLY MILLIONAIRES' CLUB TV game show in 2015.\nEarnings from equity investments\nThe decrease in earnings from equity investments of $5.1 million was primarily due to an $11.3 million impairment charge recorded during the year ended December 31, 2016 related to an equity investment in China.\nINTERACTIVE\nThe following table summarizes the primary business activities included in the Interactive business segment as of December 31, 2017.\n\nSocial Gaming\nIn our social gaming business, we generate revenue from the sale of virtual coins, chips or bingo cards, which players can use to play slot, table games or bingo games (i.e., spin in the case of slot games, bet in the case of table games and use of bingo cards in the case of bingo games). The games are primarily our WMS, Bally, Barcrest, SHFL, Dragonplay\u00ae and recently acquired Bingo Showdown branded games. In addition, we also offer third-party branded games and original content.\nOur apps include Jackpot Party Social Casino, Gold Fish\u00ae Casino Slots, Quick Hit Slots and Hot Shot Casino, Dragonplay Slots\u00ae, Dragonplay Poker\u00ae, Blazing 7s Slots and Bingo Showdown on various platforms which include: Facebook, Apple, Google Play, Amazon Kindle, Yahoo (through March 2016) and Microsoft Windows.\nRMG\nIn our RMG business, we provide game content to real-money online casino operators, primarily in Europe. We host the play of our game content on our centrally-located servers (often referred to as remote game servers) that are integrated with the online casino operators' websites and mobile applications. We typically earn a percentage of the operator's net gaming revenue generated by the games we host.\nSG Universe\nSG Universe includes Play4Fun NetworkTM interactive services for land based casino operators under which we provide our customers the ability to customize marketing to players while giving players access to their loyalty reward credits and the ability to make on-property reservations. We host play-for-fun and play-for-free services for traditional land-based casinos and earn revenue based on fixed fees, a share of the proceeds from the sale of virtual coins, or a mix of fixed fees and a share of such proceeds. We provide a social casino platform delivered through a land based casino operator's branded website and mobile application.\nWe believe that growth in our Interactive business is driven largely through new channels of distribution, such as the various types of mobile gaming platforms, the expansion of legal interactive RMG jurisdictions, the addition of social gaming products, the number and quality of our proprietary and third-party branded games released and available to players, the addition of\ntraditional land-based casino operators and RMG operators that are not currently customers, the effectiveness of our marketing efforts designed to engage new players and re-engage existing players, and the prominence of our offerings on operators' websites, which we do not control.\nRevenues from our Interactive services to external customers accounted for 14%, 12% and 8% of our total revenues in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nAs described in Note 13, during the fourth quarter of 2017, we acquired a non-controlling interest in NYX, which is a leading digital gaming software supplier for interactive, social and mobile gaming worldwide. On January 5, 2018, we successfully completed the NYX acquisition.\nCurrent year update\nWe continue to pursue our multi-product strategy in our social gaming B2C business and, late in the first quarter of 2017, we launched 88 Fortunes Slots on mobile worldwide.\nOn April 7, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Spicerack, a privately held mobile and social game company, which has allowed us to incorporate the successful Bingo Showdown game into our portfolio.\nOn July 7, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Red7, a privately held U.K.-based mobile and interactive casino content developer, which expands our existing portfolio of mobile and interactive game titles.\nResults of Operations and Key Performance Indicators\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nRevenue\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nnm = not meaningful\npp = percentage points\n(1) Mobile penetration is defined by percentage of B2C social gaming revenue generated from mobile platforms.\n(2) MAU = Monthly Active Users and is a count of unique visitors to our sites during a month.\n(3) DAU = Daily Active Users, a count of unique visitors to our sites during a day.\n(4) ARPDAU = Average revenue per DAU is calculated by dividing revenue for a period by the DAU for the period by the number of days for the period.\nThe increase in revenue compared to 2016 reflects growth of $87.6 million or 32% from social gaming revenue which is attributable to the ongoing popularity of Jackpot Party Social Casino and the success of more recent apps, such as the introduction of the 88 Fortunes app in the first quarter of 2017, and the impact of the April 2017 acquisition of Spicerack and its Bingo Showdown game.\nOperating income\nThe increase in operating income reflects greater profitability as a result of revenue growth. SG&A expense and R&D expense increased as a result of higher marketing and player acquisition costs, coupled with new product development costs to support ongoing growth initiatives for which revenue has not yet been recognized.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nRevenue\nThe increase in revenue compared to 2015 reflects growth of $103.8 million or 61% from social gaming revenue which is attributable to the ongoing popularity of Jackpot Party Social Casino and the success of the recently launched Quick Hit Slots, Hot Shot Casino, and Blazing 7s Slots social gaming apps.\nOperating income\nThe increase in operating income reflects greater profitability as a result of revenue growth. SG&A expense and R&D expense increased as a result of higher marketing and player acquisition costs, coupled with new product development costs to support ongoing growth initiatives for which revenue has not yet been recognized.\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE\nFor a description of recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 1.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nInformation regarding significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 and in the relevant sections of applicable Notes. As stated in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe that the estimates, assumptions, and judgments involved in the following accounting policies have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements:\n \u2022 Revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements; \n \u2022 Goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles, long lived assets and finite lived intangible assets- impairment assessment; \n \u2022 Allowance for doubtful accounts - Notes receivable; \n \u2022 Income taxes; and \n \u2022 Legal contingencies. \nRevenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements\nSome of our arrangements include multiple elements. As a result, significant contract interpretation may be required to determine the appropriate accounting, including the identification of deliverables considered to be separate units of accounting, the allocation of the transaction price among elements in the arrangement and the timing of revenue recognition for each of those elements.\nWe recognize revenue for delivered elements as separate units of accounting when the delivered elements have standalone value to the customer. For elements with no standalone value, we recognize revenue consistent with the pattern of\nthe delivery of the final deliverable. In arrangements with combined units of accounting, changes in the allocation of the transaction price among elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition for the contract but will not change the total revenue recognized for the contract.\nWe establish the selling prices used for each non-software deliverable based on vendor specific objective evidence ( VSOE\u201d) of selling price, if available, third-party evidence ( TPE\u201d), if VSOE of selling price is not available, or estimated selling price ( ESP\u201d), if neither VSOE of selling price nor TPE is available. We establish VSOE of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and, in rare instances, using the price established by management having the relevant authority. We evaluate TPE of selling price by reviewing largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers. ESP is established based on management's judgment considering internal factors such as margin objectives, pricing practices, customer segment pricing strategies and the product life cycle. Consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and industry technology life cycles. In most arrangements with multiple elements, the transaction price is allocated to the individual units of accounting at inception of the arrangement based on their relative selling price.\nFor software elements, we follow the industry specific software guidance which only allows for the use of VSOE in establishing fair value. Generally, VSOE of fair value is the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately or the price established by management for a product that is not yet sold. ESPs are established as best estimates of what the selling prices would be if the deliverables were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The ESP for software elements is based on the criteria explained in the preceding paragraph. We are required to use judgment and consider multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. If we were to change any of these judgments or estimates, it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period. Amounts for fees collected or invoiced and due relating to arrangements where revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized when the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied.\nGoodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units on at least an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) annually (October 1) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.\nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment, if any, for each reporting unit. This is especially true for reporting units where goodwill has been partially impaired as a result of recent impairment assessments, and accordingly, is at risk of additional partial or total impairment should we experience relatively minor adverse changes in our significant assumptions. Recent goodwill impairments (see Note 11) are as follows:\n\nOther than the reporting units with recent partial impairments noted in the table above, we have no other reporting units where we currently believe significant risk of impairment exists. Our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2017, resulted in cushion of 35% and 78% for International Lottery Systems and SG Gaming reporting units, respectively, for which we recorded impairment charges during years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (as disclosed in the table above).\nA substantial portion of our legacy U.K. Gaming reporting unit revenue is concentrated with LadbrokesCoral Group, which operates LBOs in the U.K. In October 2017, the U.K. government published its consultation on the review of stakes and prizes for all gaming terminals in the U.K. gaming sector. The consultation recommends a reduction in stakes on certain\ngaming machines. Although the consultation period closed in January 2018, any decision by the U.K. government was not enacted into law as of our goodwill impairment testing date nor as of December 31, 2017, and accordingly was not taken into consideration for related projections. The ultimate impact of a change in the allowed stakes on U.K. gaming machines was not determinable as of our goodwill impairment testing date.\nOur annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2017, which was based on laws and regulations enacted as of the testing date and objective factors including normalized historical results, resulted in a cushion of 85% for our legacy U.K. Gaming reporting unit. Although the estimated fair value of our legacy U.K. Gaming reporting unit was in excess of its respective carrying values, any enacted regulatory changes resulting in a significant reduction to allowable stakes could negatively impact our customers and our U.K. gaming business and could potentially result in an impairment of goodwill. As of December 31, 2017, our legacy U.K Gaming reporting unit carrying amount of goodwill was $184.8 million.\nGoodwill is reviewed for impairment using either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative one-step process (following our adoption of ASU 2016-18 in the first quarter of 2017). If we perform a qualitative assessment and determine that the fair value of a reporting unit more likely than not exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is necessary. For reporting units where we perform the quantitative process, we are required to compare the fair value of each reporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows, and a market approach to the respective carrying value, which includes goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying value is higher than the fair value, we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit's estimated fair value.\nDiscounted cash flow analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, the relative risk of achieving those cash flows, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. When using the market approach, we make judgments about the comparability of publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses or public transactions information for similar businesses. We base our judgments on factors such as size, growth rates, profitability, risk, and return on investment. We also make judgments when adjusting market multiples of revenue, and earnings for these companies to reflect their relative similarity to our business. Our analysis also includes comparison of our reporting units' total estimated fair values to the total enterprise value and assessing the implied control premium, supporting the reasonableness of our concluded estimated fair values determined under the combination of income and market approaches as of our testing date. Refer to Note 11 for key estimates and assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis for SG Gaming, U.S. Lottery Systems and International Lottery Systems reporting units in periods during which our impairment testing for these reporting units resulted in an impairment charge.\nWe test our indefinite-lived assets annually for impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived asset is less than its carrying value or when circumstances no longer continue to support an indefinite useful life. An impairment test may be qualitative or quantitative, depending on the circumstances. When a quantitative test is performed, a fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow approach where projections of future cash flows generated by those assets are discounted using an estimated discount rate. We estimate the fair value of our indefinite-lived assets using the relief-from-royalty method, which uses several significant assumptions, including an assumed royalty rate, revenue projections that consider both historical and estimated future results, general economic and market conditions, and the impact of planned business and operational strategies. If the indicated fair value of the indefinite-lived asset exceeds its carrying value, the asset is not considered impaired. In the event that the fair value of the indefinite-lived asset is less than its carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment charge.\nLong-lived assets and finite lived intangible assets\nWe evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets and other long-lived assets with finite useful lives by comparing the carrying value of the asset group to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows that we expect the asset to generate if events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets are not recoverable. Any impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value. The fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow approach where projections of future cash flows generated by those assets are discounted using an estimated discount rate. Significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows. We also make judgments about the remaining useful lives of intangible assets and other long-lived assets that have finite lives. While we believe our estimates of future operating results and projected cash flows are reasonable, any significant adverse changes in key assumptions (i.e., adverse change in the extent or manner which an asset (asset group) is being used or expectation that, more likely than not, an asset (asset group) will be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of its useful\nlife) or adverse changes in economic and market conditions may cause a change in our evaluation of recoverability or our estimation of fair value and could result in an impairment charge that could be material to our financial statements.\nAllowance for doubtful accounts - Notes receivable\nWe reserve an estimated amount for notes receivables that may not be collected to reduce our receivables to their net carrying value. Methodologies for estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts range from specific reserves to various percentages applied to aged receivables. Estimations of doubtful accounts are focused on receivables which are more than 90 days past due. We review a variety of relevant qualitative information such as collection experience, economic conditions and customer-specific financial conditions to evaluate credit risk in recording the allowance for doubtful accounts or as an indicator of an impaired loan. We also evaluate the macroeconomic and political environment of our customers to determine if these factors are an indication that a contractual obligation may be at risk to be collected in full. We may be required to make judgments related to the above factors if the information is not easily accessible. We may also have instances where we do not have an established history with a customer which also limits our ability to evaluate customer specific factors. Unexpected changes in the underlying financial condition of our customers or in the macroeconomic and political environment of a specific geographic region could result in a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position. As of December 31, 2017, a 10% increase or decrease to the allowance determined within notes receivable would change the reserve by approximately $2.1 million.\nIncome taxes\nWe are subject to the income tax laws of the many jurisdictions in which we operate. These tax laws are complex, and the manner in which they apply to our facts is sometimes open to interpretation. In establishing the provision for income taxes, we must make judgments about the application of these inherently complex tax laws.\nDespite our belief that our tax return positions are consistent with applicable tax laws, we believe that taxing authorities could challenge certain positions. Settlement of any challenge can result in no change, a complete disallowance, or some partial adjustment reached through negotiations or litigation. We record tax benefits for uncertain tax positions based upon management's evaluation of the information available at the reporting date. To be recognized in the financial statements, a tax benefit must be at least more likely than not of being sustained based on technical merits. The benefit for positions meeting the recognition threshold is measured as the largest benefit more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. Significant judgment is required in making these determinations and adjustments to uncertain tax positions may be necessary to reflect actual taxes payable upon settlement. Adjustments related to positions impacting the effective tax rate affect the provision for income taxes. Adjustments related to positions impacting the timing of deductions impact deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nOur income tax positions and analysis are based on currently enacted tax law. Future changes in tax law could significantly impact the provision for income taxes, the amount of taxes payable, and the deferred tax asset and liability balances in future periods. Deferred tax assets generally represent tax benefits for tax deductions or credits available in future tax returns. Certain estimates and assumptions are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making this assessment, management analyzes and estimates the impact of future taxable income, available carry-backs and carry-forwards, reversing temporary differences and available prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. We have recorded valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. Should a change in facts or circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the ultimate realizability of a deferred tax asset, we record or adjust the related valuation allowance in the annual period that the change in facts and circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding increase or decrease in the provision for income taxes.\nLegal contingencies\nWe are subject to certain legal proceedings, demands, claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business. We review the status of each significant matter quarterly and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability and an expense for the estimated loss. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the range of the loss can be reasonably estimated, then we disclose the range of the possible loss. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether a potential loss is probable, reasonably possible, or remote and in the determination of whether a potential exposure is reasonably estimable. Our accruals are based on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the liabilities and disclosures related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Potential legal liabilities and the revision of estimates of legal liabilities could have a material impact on\nour results of operations, cash flows and financial position. For discussion of the Company's legal proceedings, see Note 22, which is incorporated by reference into Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND WORKING CAPITAL\nSources of liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2017, our principal sources of liquidity, other than cash flows provided by operating activities, were cash and cash equivalents and amounts available under our revolving credit facility discussed below under \"Credit Agreement and Other Debt.\"\nSubsequent to December 31, 2017, we successfully completed a series of financing transactions, including a private offering of an additional $900.0 million principal amount of our 2025 Secured Notes, \u20ac325.0 million of 3.375% new senior secured notes due 2026 and \u20ac250 million of 5.500% new senior unsecured notes due 2026, and an amendment to our credit agreement to refinance our existing term loan B-4 facility and increase the term loans outstanding by $900.0 million under a new term loan B-5 facility (collectively referred to as the February 2018 Refinancing\u201d). We used a portion of the net proceeds of the February 2018 Refinancing to redeem $1,400.0 million of our outstanding 2022 Secured Notes, prepay a portion of our revolver borrowings under our credit agreement and pay accrued and unpaid interest thereon plus related premiums, fees and expenses. We intend to use the remaining net proceeds to redeem the remaining $700.0 million of our outstanding 2022 Secured Notes and pay accrued and unpaid interest thereon plus related premiums on or around March 2, 2018. In connection with the amendment to our credit agreement, the interest rate on our term loans was decreased from LIBOR plus 325 to LIBOR plus 275. We also increased the amount of the revolving credit agreement by $24.0 million to $620.2 million through October 18, 2018, with a step-down in availability at that time to $445.7 million until the extended maturity on October 18, 2020. As a result of these financing transactions, we have lowered our annual cash interest cost by approximately $69.0 million at current interest rates and extended the maturity of $2,100.0 million of our debt from 2022 out to 2024, 2025 and 2026.\nSubsequent to the February 2018 Refinancing and following our intended redemption of our outstanding 2022 Secured Notes (described above), the aggregate principal amount of debt outstanding would be approximately $9.0 billion, based on a Euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate of 1.2288 as of February 21, 2018.\nIn December 2017, we entered into a lender joinder agreement to our credit agreement with an additional revolving commitment lender. Pursuant to the joinder agreement, the amount of the revolving credit facility under the credit agreement was increased by $40.0 million.\nIn October 2017, we successfully completed a private offering of $350.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2025 Secured Notes (the \"October Financing\"). We used the net proceeds of this offering, together with cash on hand and borrowings under the revolving credit facility under our credit agreement, to finance the NYX acquisition, including the refinancing of certain indebtedness of NYX, and to pay related fees and expenses.\nDuring the third quarter of 2017, we completed a refinancing transaction (the August 2017 Refinancing\u201d), which included an amendment to our credit agreement, which further extended the maturity of our term loans and reduced the applicable interest rate on the term loans. The August 2017 Refinancing further lowered our annual cash interest cost and extended the maturity of approximately 40% of our debt from 2021 to 2024.\nDuring the first quarter of 2017, we completed a series of refinancing transactions (the \"February 2017 Refinancing\"), which included a private offering of $1.15 billion in aggregate principal amount of 2022 Secured Notes, and an amendment to our credit agreement, which extended the maturity of our term loans and revolving credit facility and reduced the applicable interest rate on the term loans. The February 2017 Refinancing reduced the total principal value of our debt by $45.0 million, including payment of the remaining $45.0 million on our revolving credit facility; lowered our annual cash interest cost; extended the maturity to 2021 and 2022 for approximately 95% of our debt and significantly reduced our exposure to floating interest rates.\nOn January 10, 2018, in connection with the reincorporation merger, the Surviving Corporation assumed all of the obligations of SGC under the credit agreement, the Senior Notes and the Subordinated Notes, and became a guarantor of all of that indebtedness.\nFor further information on the February 2018 Refinancing, February 2017 Refinancing, the August 2017 Refinancing, the October 2017 Financing, the 2025 Secured Notes and the joinder agreement, see Note 16.\nCash and available revolver capacity\n\nThe amount of our available cash and cash equivalents fluctuates principally based on borrowings or repayments under our credit facilities, investments, acquisitions and changes in our working capital position. The borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility will depend on the amount of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit issued and on us remaining in compliance with the covenants under our credit agreement, including a maintenance covenant based on consolidated net first lien leverage. Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2017 included funds that were held to complete the NYX acquisition on January 5, 2018. We were in compliance with the covenants under our credit agreement as of December 31, 2017.\nWe believe that our cash flow from operations, available cash and cash equivalents and available borrowing capacity under our existing or anticipated financing arrangements will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future; however, we cannot assure that this will be the case. We believe that substantially all cash held outside the U.S. is free from legal encumbrances or similar restrictions that would prevent it from being available to meet our global liquidity needs.\nTotal cash held by our foreign subsidiaries was $57.6 million as of December 31, 2017.\nOur Gaming operations and Lottery systems businesses generally require significant upfront capital expenditures. In connection with a renewal or bid of a Gaming operations or Lottery systems contract, a customer may seek to obtain new equipment or impose new service requirements, which may require additional capital expenditures in order to retain or win the contract. Our ability to generate revenue and to continue to procure new contracts will depend on, among other things, our then present liquidity levels or our ability to obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms. If we do not have adequate liquidity or are unable to obtain financing for these upfront cash payments on favorable terms or at all, we may not be able to bid on certain contracts, which could restrict our ability to grow and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and other obligations depends on our ability to generate cash in the future. We may also, from time to time, repurchase, or otherwise retire or refinance our debt, through our subsidiaries or otherwise. Such activities, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, contractual restrictions and other factors, and the amounts involved may or may not be material. If we need to refinance all or part of our indebtedness at or before maturity, we cannot assure that we will be able to obtain new financing or to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In the event we pursue significant acquisitions or other expansion opportunities, conduct significant repurchases of our outstanding securities, or refinance or repay existing debt, we may need to raise additional capital either through the public or private issuance of equity or debt securities or through additional borrowings under our existing financing arrangements, which sources of funds may not necessarily be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nIn addition, U.S. lottery customers generally require service providers to provide performance bonds in connection with the relevant contract. As of December 31, 2017, our outstanding performance bonds totaled $230.7 million. Our ability to obtain performance bonds on commercially reasonable terms is subject to our financial condition and to prevailing market conditions, which may be impacted by economic and political events. Although we have not experienced difficulty in obtaining such bonds to date, we cannot assure that we will continue to be able to obtain performance bonds on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nAs a result of the LNS concession renewal, described in Note 13, we are responsible for our pro rata share of the total \u20ac800 million payment required to be made by LNS to retain the lottery concession, which is \u20ac160.0 million. We funded \u20ac10 million of our share during the fourth quarter of 2017, with the remainder to be funded in April and October of 2018 in the amount of \u20ac60 million and \u20ac90 million, respectively. Contributions to LNS are expected to be funded out of existing cash and additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\nCash Flow Summary\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nCash flows from operating activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the prior year period increased primarily due to a $174.5 million increase in incremental net earnings after reconciling adjustments and changes in deferred taxes, partially offset by changes in working capital accounts as the prior year benefited from the timing of receivable collections and cash disbursements coupled with various other changes in our working capital accounts. The changes in our working capital accounts during the year ended December 31, 2017 were primarily driven by the following:\n \u2022 $48.0 million increase in accounts and notes receivable due to strong sales during the year; \n \u2022 $2.2 million increase in inventories primarily due to the timing of orders and deployment of units in our Gaming segment; and \n \u2022 $28.6 million positive net impact on cash flows from changes in other current assets and liabilities as a result of the timing of expenditures and interest payments.  In April 2017, we entered into a settlement and seven-year patent cross-license agreement with another party that resolved outstanding intellectual property matters between the two companies. As part of this agreement, we received a $20.0 million advance royalty payment.\nCash flows from investing activities\nNet cash used in investing activities increased primarily due to the business acquisitions described in Note 9, the November 2017 acquisition of 36% of the outstanding ordinary shares and other securities of NYX for $91.9 million described in Note 13 and $20.8 million in higher capital expenditures, primarily associated with our recently launched WAP and other participation units. Capital expenditures are composed of investments in systems, equipment and other assets related to contracts, property and equipment, intangible assets and software.\nCash flows from financing activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased primarily due to the February 2017 Refinancing, August 2017 Refinancing and October 2017 Financing transactions described in Note 16 and revolving credit facility borrowings in anticipation of closing the NYX acquisition on January 5, 2018, combined with lower principal payments on the long-term debt during the period. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we also incurred $58.7 million in debt issuance and deferred financing costs.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nCash flows from operating activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $4.8 million over the prior year. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the incremental net earnings, net of non-cash items of $97.3 million and a $92.5 million decrease in working capital and other items.\nCash flows from investing activities\nThe decrease in net cash used in investing activities of $32.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily reflected (1) a decrease of $13.4 million in distributions of capital on equity investments; (2) a decrease of capital expenditures of $50.7 million; (3) an incremental change in restricted cash of $9.6 million; and (4) an increase in proceeds from asset sales\nof $10.0 million compared to 2015. Capital expenditures are composed of investments in systems, equipment and other assets related to contracts, property and equipment, intangible assets and software.\nCash flows from financing activities\nThe increase in net cash used in financing activities of $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to: (1) an increase in the payments on license obligations of $9.7 million; and, (2) an increase in the net redemptions of Class A common stock under stock-based compensation plans of $5.2 million, partially offset by (3) a decrease in net payments of long-term debt of $1.6 million.\nCredit Agreement and Other Debt\nFor additional information regarding our credit agreement and other debt, interest rate risk and interest rate hedging instruments, see
