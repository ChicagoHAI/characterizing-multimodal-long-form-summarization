As of December 31, 2015, we owned three office properties, comprising 1.2 million rentable square feet, and were partners with third parties in three joint ventures holding two office properties, comprising four buildings and 0.8 million rentable square feet, and a sports club associated with our City Square property in Phoenix, Arizona. Our ownership interest percentage in each of these joint ventures is 5.0%. As of December 31, 2015, our property portfolio included office buildings in Honolulu and Phoenix.\nOur advisor is Shidler Pacific Advisors, LLC ( Shidler Pacific Advisors\u201d), an entity that is owned and controlled by Jay H. Shidler ( Mr. Shidler\u201d), our Chairman of the Board. Lawrence J. Taff, our President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, also serves as President of Shidler Pacific Advisors. Shidler Pacific Advisors is responsible for the day-to-day operation and management of the Company, including management of our wholly-owned properties.\nWe maintain a website at www.pacificofficeproperties.com. The information on or accessible through our website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Copies of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to such reports are available without charge on our website or upon request to us. In addition, our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is available without charge on our website or upon request to us. Amendments to, or waivers from, our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that apply to our executive officers will be posted to our website. We also post or otherwise make available on our website from time to time other information that may be of interest to our investors.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThis discussion and analysis of the historical financial condition and results of operations is based upon the accompanying consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses in the reporting period. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates and assumptions. Summarized below are those accounting policies that require material subjective or complex judgments and that have the most significant impact on financial conditions and results of operations. These estimates have been evaluated on an ongoing basis, based upon\ninformation currently available and on various assumptions that management believes are reasonable as of the date hereof. In addition, other companies in similar businesses may use different estimation policies and methodologies, which may impact the comparability of the results of operations and financial conditions to those of other companies.\nInvestments in Real Estate. We account for acquisitions of real estate utilizing the purchase method and, accordingly, the results of operations of acquired properties are included in our results of operations from the respective dates of acquisition.\nInvestments in real estate properties are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation, amortization and impairment. Our wholly-owned properties, all of which were contributed to us at the time of our formation transactions in 2008, are stated at their historical net cost basis in an amount attributable to the ownership interests in such properties owned by Mr. Shidler prior to the formation transactions. Additions to land, buildings and improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment and construction in progress are recorded at cost.\nTransaction costs related to acquisitions are expensed. Costs associated with developing space for its intended use are capitalized and amortized over their estimated useful lives, commencing at the later of the improvement completion date or the lease commencement date.\nEstimates of future cash flows and other valuation techniques are used to allocate the acquisition cost of acquired properties among land, buildings and improvements, and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities such as amounts related to in-place at-market leases, acquired below-market leases, and acquired above- and below-market ground leases.\nThe fair values of real estate assets acquired are determined on an as-if-vacant\u201d basis. The as-if-vacant\u201d fair value is allocated to land, and where applicable, buildings, tenant improvements and equipment based on comparable sales and other relevant information obtained in connection with the acquisition of the property.\nFair value is assigned to below-market leases based on the difference between (a) the contractual amounts to be paid by the tenant based on the existing lease and (b) management's estimate of current market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, over the remaining terms of the in-place leases. Capitalized below-market lease amounts are reflected in Acquired below-market leases, net,\u201d in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are amortized as an increase in rental revenue over the remaining initial non-cancellable lease terms plus the terms of any below-market fixed rate renewal options that are considered bargain renewal options. If a tenant vacates its space prior to the contractual termination of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease, any unamortized balance, net of the security deposit, of the related intangible is written off.\nFair value is also assigned to tenant relationships. Capitalized tenant relationship amounts are included in Intangible assets, net\u201d in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are amortized to Depreciation and amortization\u201d in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Amounts are amortized over the remaining terms of the respective leases even if a tenant vacates prior to the contractual termination of the lease. An adjustment to tenant relationship amounts occurs should the property experience an impairment loss.\nThe aggregate value of other acquired intangible assets consists of acquired in-place leases. The fair value allocated to acquired in-place leases consists of a variety of components including, but not necessarily limited to: (a) the value associated with avoiding the cost of originating the acquired in-place lease (i.e. the market cost to execute a lease, including leasing commissions and legal fees, if any); (b) the value associated with lost revenue related to tenant reimbursable operating costs estimated to be incurred during the assumed lease-up period (i.e. real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses); (c) the value associated with lost rental revenue from existing leases during the assumed lease-up period; and (d) the value associated with any other inducements to secure a tenant lease. The value assigned to acquired in-place leases is amortized over the remaining lives of the related leases.\nWe record the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired (including identified intangible assets) and liabilities assumed as goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as a reporting unit on an annual basis, during the fourth quarter of each calendar year, or more frequently, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. See Goodwill\u201d below. An impairment loss for an asset group is allocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a pro-rata basis using the relative\ncarrying amounts of those assets, except that the loss allocated to an individual long-lived asset shall not reduce the carrying amount of that asset below its fair value. A description of our testing policy is set forth in Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\u201d below.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets. In accordance with the provisions of the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets Subsections of Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 360, Property, Plant and Equipment, we assess the potential for impairment of our long-lived assets, including real estate properties, whenever events occur or a change in circumstances indicate that the recorded carrying value might not be fully recoverable. Indicators of potential impairment include significant decreases in occupancy levels and/or rental rates or a change in strategy that results in a decreased holding period. We determine whether impairment in value has occurred by comparing the estimated future cash flows, undiscounted and excluding interest, expected from the use and eventual disposition of the asset to its carrying value. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, the real estate or intangible carrying value is reduced to fair value and impairment loss is recognized. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value, less costs to sell.\nNo impairment charges for our wholly-owned properties were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $0.5 million on our Clifford Center property as a result of the property's fair value, net of costs to sell, being below its current carrying value, in connection with the anticipated sale of the property, which was completed in January 2015. The non-cash impairment charges are included in Loss from discontinued operations\u201d on the consolidated statement of operations.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures. Our investments in joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method of accounting because we exercise significant influence over, but do not control, our joint ventures. Our joint venture partners have substantive participating rights, including approval of and participation in setting operating budgets. Accordingly, we have determined that the equity method of accounting is appropriate for our investments in joint ventures.\nInvestments in unconsolidated joint ventures are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently adjusted for our proportionate equity in the net income or net loss of the joint ventures, contributions made to, or distributions received from, the joint ventures and other adjustments. We record distributions of operating profit from our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures as part of cash flows from operating activities and distributions related to a capital transaction, such as a refinancing transaction or sale, as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nWe evaluate all investments in accordance with the guidance of FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-17, Consolidations (Topic 810), Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest Entities, which requires ongoing assessments of the investments to determine whether or not they are variable interest entities ( VIEs\u201d) and if they are VIEs, whether or not we are determined to be the primary beneficiary. We would consolidate a VIE if it is determined that we are the primary beneficiary. We use qualitative analyses to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Consideration of various factors could include, but is not limited to, the purpose and design of the VIE, risks that the VIE was designed to create and pass through, the form of our ownership interest, our representation of the entity's governing body, the size and seniority of our investment, our ability to participate in policy making decisions, and the rights of the other investors to participate in the decision making process and/or liquidate the venture, if applicable. We currently do not hold any investments in VIEs.\nImpairment of Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures. Our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures is subject to a periodic impairment review and is considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. An investment in an unconsolidated joint venture that we identify as having an indicator of impairment is subject to further analysis to determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired, in which case we write down the investment to its estimated fair value.\nNo impairment charges were recorded in our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures for the year ended December 31, 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $0.9 million to write off our investment in the POP San Diego joint venture due to uncertainty surrounding its recoverability. The charge is included in Equity in net (loss) earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures\u201d on the consolidated statement of operations.\nDiscontinued Operations. The revenue, expenses, impairment and/or gain on sale of operating properties that meet the applicable criteria of FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360), Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity are reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations. A gain on sale, if any, is recognized in the period the property is disposed of.\nIn determining whether to report the results of operations, impairment and/or gain on sale of operating properties as discontinued operations, we evaluate whether the property that has been disposed of by sale, disposed of other than by sale or is classified as held for sale represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on our operations and financial results. A strategic shift could include the disposal of a major geographical area, a major line of business, a major equity method investment or other major parts of an entity.\nWe classify properties as held for sale when certain criteria set forth in the Long-Lived Assets Classified as Held for Sale Subsections of FASB ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment, are met, including when we receive cash deposits towards the purchase of our properties. At that time, we present the non-cash assets and liabilities of the property held for sale separately in our consolidated balance sheet. We cease recording depreciation and amortization expense at the time a property is classified as held for sale. Properties held for sale are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or their estimated fair value, less estimated costs to sell. In the event that a property classified as held for sale no longer meets the criteria for held for sale classification, the property is reclassified as held for use at the lower of the fair value or the depreciated basis as if the property had continued to be used. As of December 31, 2014, the Clifford Center property was classified as held for sale. In January 2015, we completed the sale of the Clifford Center property, and accordingly, the associated assets and liabilities had been removed from our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 and the results of its operations before the sale, including post-closing activities since the sale, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 are included in Discontinued operations\u201d in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nGoodwill. We record the excess cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired (including identified intangible assets) and liabilities assumed as goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter of each calendar year, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that a possible impairment has occurred. The assessment of impairment involves a two-step process whereby an initial assessment for potential impairment is performed, followed by a measurement of the amount of impairment, if any. Impairment testing is performed using the fair value approach, which requires the use of estimates and judgment, at the reporting unit\u201d level. A reporting unit is the operating segment, or a business that is one level below the operating segment if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management at that level. The reporting unit's fair value is calculated as the discounted future cash flows based on management's best estimate of the applicable capitalization and discount rates. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. An impairment charge is recognized as a charge against income equal to the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied value on the date of the impairment. Factors that may cause goodwill to be impaired include, but may not be limited to, a sustained decline in our stock price and the occurrence, or sustained existence, of adverse economic conditions or decreased cash flow from our properties.\nWe consider our wholly-owned properties one reporting unit due to similar geographic and economic characteristics. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, goodwill of our wholly-owned properties amounted to $37.7 million and $39.1 million, respectively. We wrote off approximately $1.4 million of goodwill associated with the sale of the Clifford Center property in January 2015.\nRevenue Recognition. The following four criteria must be met before we recognize revenue and gains:\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the delivery has occurred or services rendered;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the fee is fixed and determinable; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>collectability is reasonably assured.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAll of our tenant leases are classified as operating leases. For all leases with scheduled rent increases or other adjustments, minimum rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases. Straight-line rent receivable represents rental revenue recognized on a straight-line basis in excess of billed rents and this amount is included in Deferred\nrents\u201d on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The straight line rent adjustment included in Rental revenues\u201d in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations was $0.02 million and ($0.01) million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Reimbursements from tenants for real estate taxes, excise taxes and other recoverable operating expenses are recognized as revenues in the period the applicable costs are incurred.\nCapitalized below-market lease amounts are amortized as an increase to rental revenue over the remaining initial non-cancellable lease terms plus the terms of any below-market fixed rate renewal options that are considered bargain renewal options.\nWe have leased space to certain tenants under non-cancellable operating leases, which provide for percentage rents based upon tenant revenues. Percentage rental income is recorded in Rental revenues\u201d in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nRental revenue from parking operations and month-to-month leases or leases with no scheduled rent increases or other adjustments is recognized on a monthly basis when earned.\nLease termination fees, which are included in Other\u201d revenue of the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, are recognized when the related leases are canceled and we have no continuing obligation to provide services to such former tenants.\nOther\u201d revenue on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations generally includes income incidental to our operations and is recognized when earned.\nTenant Receivables. Tenant receivables are recorded and carried at the amount billable per the applicable lease agreement, less any allowance for doubtful accounts. An allowance for doubtful accounts is made when collection of the full amounts is no longer considered probable. Tenant receivables are included in Rents and other receivables, net,\u201d in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. If a tenant fails to make contractual payments beyond any allowance, we may recognize bad debt expense in future periods equal to the amount of unpaid rent. We take into consideration factors including historical termination, default activity and current economic conditions to evaluate the level of reserve necessary. We had an allowance for doubtful accounts of $0.3 million and $0.2 million, as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nWe had a total of $1.8 million and $1.7 million of lease security available in security deposits, as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nIncome Taxes. We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we currently distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders. Also, at least 95% of gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources. We intend to adhere to these requirements and maintain our REIT status. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on taxable income that we distribute currently to our stockholders. However, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and property, and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income, if any. Management believes that we have distributed and will continue to distribute a sufficient majority of our taxable income, if any, in the form of dividends and distributions to our stockholders and unit holders. Accordingly, we have not recognized any provision for income taxes.\nThe Company is subject to the provisions of FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes which prescribes a more-likely-than-not threshold for the financial statement recognition of uncertain tax positions. ASC 740 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. On a quarterly basis, the Company evaluates the need for income tax accruals in accordance with ASC 740.\nNon-Controlling Interests. We account for non-controlling interests in accordance with FASB ASC 810, Consolidation. In accordance with FASB ASC 810, we report non-controlling interests in subsidiaries within equity in the consolidated financial statements, but separate from the parent stockholders' equity. Net income attributable to non-controlling interests is presented as a reduction from net income in calculating net income available to common stockholders on the statement of operations. Acquisitions or dispositions of non-controlling interests that do not result in a change of control are accounted\nfor as equity transactions. In addition, FASB ASC 810 requires that a parent company recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated upon a change in control. In accordance with FASB ASC 480-10, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, non-controlling interests that are determined to be redeemable are carried at their redemption value as of the balance sheet date and reported as temporary equity. We periodically evaluate individual non-controlling interests for the ability to continue to recognize the non-controlling interest as permanent equity in the consolidated balance sheets. Any non-controlling interest that fails to qualify as permanent equity will be reclassified as temporary equity and adjusted to the greater of (a) the carrying amount, or (b) its redemption value as of the end of the period in which the determination is made, the resulting adjustment is recorded in the consolidated statement of operations. See Note 12 for a more detailed discussion.\nResults of Operations\nOur results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 include the results of our wholly-owned properties (Waterfront Plaza, Davies Pacific Center and Pan Am Building) and our equity in the net earnings (loss) of our unconsolidated joint ventures. Discontinued operations reflects the net results of operations of the Clifford Center property, which was sold in January 2015. The impact on our results of operations from sales of unconsolidated joint venture properties during these periods was not material.\nOverview\nAs of December 31, 2015, our wholly-owned properties were 88.0% leased, with 136,236 square feet available, under a total of 327 leases. As of that date, 16.0% of our leased square footage was scheduled to expire during 2016 and another 12.6% of our leased square footage was scheduled to expire during 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our wholly-owned properties were 85.0% leased, with 178,295 square feet available, under a total of 349 leases. As of that date, 14.9% of our leased square footage was scheduled to expire during 2015 and another 12.5% of our leased square footage was scheduled to expire during 2016.\nThe changes in vacant space for our wholly-owned properties for the period from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015 are shown below:\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Rentable Square Feet\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vacant space available at December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>178,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sale of Clifford Center property\n</td> <td>(24,901\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leases expired on December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>2,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expired or terminated during the period\n</td> <td>222,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Square footage adjustments and exclusions(1)\n</td> <td>(9,205\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total space available for lease\n</td> <td>368,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New leases\n</td> <td>61,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Renewed leases\n</td> <td>170,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total space leased during the period\n</td> <td>232,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vacant space available at December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>136,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n___________________________\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Includes adjustments for remeasured square footage, right-to-use leases and month-to-month storage leases.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe receive income primarily from rental revenue (including tenant reimbursements) from our office properties and, to a lesser extent, from our parking revenues. Our office properties are typically leased to tenants with good credit for terms ranging from two to 20 years. We perform credit evaluations on new tenants by requesting and reviewing their financial statements and recent tax returns. During the terms of our leases, we monitor the credit quality of our tenants by reviewing the timeliness of their lease payments. In addition, we may review financial statements, operating statements and/or performance of other financial covenants as allowed for under their lease.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2015 to\nthe year ended December 31, 2014 (in thousands)\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rental\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant reimbursements\n</td> <td>16,732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(488\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Parking\n</td> <td>6,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>706\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(410\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(58.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>44,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rental property operating\n</td> <td>25,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(920\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>1,684\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>10,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(391\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest\n</td> <td>20,581\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expenses\n</td> <td>58,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59,789\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,094\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from continuing operations before equity in net earnings (loss) of unconsolidated joint ventures\n</td> <td>(14,581\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15,669\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in net earnings (loss) of unconsolidated joint ventures\n</td> <td>497\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,147\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,644\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(143.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from continuing operations\n</td> <td>(14,084\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16,816\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from discontinued operations\n</td> <td>(180\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(536\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(66.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(14,264\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(17,352\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues\nRental revenue. Total rental revenue increased by $0.6 million, or 3.1%, primarily due to increases in rental revenues at Pan Am Building for a negotiated lease incentive for a tenant in the prior year period ($0.2 million), a tenant being in holdover in the current year period ($0.1 million) and a tenant who expanded its lease ($0.1 million) and at Waterfront Plaza as a result of write-offs of deferred rent ($0.2 million) related to tenants who vacated their leased premises in the prior year period and additional deferred rent related to a significant new tenant in the current year period ($0.2 million), partially offset by a decrease in rental revenues at Davies Pacific Center related to a a tenant who vacated its leased premises in the prior year ($0.2 million).\nTenant reimbursements. Total tenant reimbursements decreased by $0.5 million, or 2.8%, primarily due to decreases in tenant recoveries for common area maintenance expenses at Davies Pacific Center ($0.3 million) and electricity reimbursements at Waterfront Plaza ($0.2 million) compared to the prior year.\nParking revenue. Total parking revenue increased by $0.3 million, or 4.4%, primarily due to increased parking rates at Waterfront Plaza.\nOther revenue. Total other revenue decreased by $0.4 million, or 58.1%, primarily due to a decrease in termination fees ($0.2 million) that arose from a significant Waterfront Plaza tenant who vacated its leased premises in the prior year period and the related write-off of the tenant's lease obligations ($0.2 million).\nExpenses\nRental property operating expenses. Total rental property operating expenses decreased by $0.9 million, or 3.5%, primarily due to decreases in utility expenses, primarily resulting from lower electricity rates, at Davies Pacific Center ($0.4 million), Pan Am Building ($0.3 million) and Waterfront Plaza ($0.8 million) compared to the prior year period, partially\noffset by increases in miscellaneous repairs and maintenance at Davies Pacific Center ($0.1 million), air conditioning repairs at Pan Am Building ($0.1 million) and bad debt expense at Waterfront Plaza ($0.2 million) and at Pan Am Building ($0.1 million) and consulting costs at Waterfront Plaza ($0.1 million) compared to the prior year period.\nGeneral and administrative expense. Total general and administrative expense decreased by an insignificant amount compared to the prior year.\nDepreciation and amortization expense. Total depreciation and amortization expense decreased by $0.4 million, or 3.5%, primarily due to a decrease in depreciation expenses at Davies Pacific Center ($0.3 million) and at Pan Am Building ($0.1 million) as a result of assets being fully depreciated.\nInterest expense. Total interest expense increased by $0.2 million, or 1.1%, primarily due to an increase in interest attributable to additional unsecured notes payable to current and former related parties issued in February 2014.\nEquity in net earnings (loss) of unconsolidated joint ventures\nEquity in net earnings (loss) of unconsolidated joint ventures increased by $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase is primarily attributable to our share of losses in, and the subsequent write-off of, our investment in the POP San Diego joint venture in the prior year period ($1.0 million) and an increase in earnings from our joint venture which sold the Valencia Corporate Center property in September 2015 ($0.7 million), partially offset by a decrease in earnings received from one of our joint ventures which was dissolved in the prior year period ($0.1 million).\nLoss from discontinued operations\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, discontinued operations reflects the net results of operations of the Clifford Center property prior to its sale in January 2015, as well as post-closing activities since the sale. For the year ended December 31, 2014, discontinued operations reflects the net results of operations of the Clifford Center property.\nCash Flows\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $0.05 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily the result of a decrease in rental operating expense payments as compared to the prior year period.\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily the result of net proceeds from the sale of our Clifford Center property in January 2015 ($8.6 million), a decrease in capital expenditures from the prior year period ($1.6 million) and a distribution from one of our joint ventures which sold the Valencia Corporate Center property in September 2015 ($0.7 million), partially offset by the repayment of interim financing by an unconsolidated joint venture ($0.4 million) in November 2014 and an increase in leasing commissions ($0.1 million) compared to the prior year period.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to the repayment of mortgage notes payable related to the Clifford Center property as a result of the sale of the property in January 2015.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, fund and maintain our assets and operations, make distributions to our stockholders and other general business needs. In order to qualify as a REIT, we must distribute to our stockholders, each calendar year, at least 90% of our REIT taxable income. As discussed further below, however, we did not declare dividends on our Class A Common Stock during fiscal 2015 and 2014, and we do not currently expect to declare dividends on our Class A Common Stock during fiscal 2016.\nOur business is capital intensive and our ability to maintain our operations depends on our cash flow from operations and our ability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms. Our primary focus is to preserve and generate cash.\nWe are working to address challenges to our liquidity position, particularly with respect to mortgage debt on each of our wholly-owned properties that is scheduled to mature in 2016. We do not currently have any committed financing sources available to refinance our debt as it matures. If we are unable to repay, extend or refinance our existing mortgage debt, we may be forced to give back one or more of these assets to the relevant mortgage lenders.\nWe expect to meet our short-term liquidity and capital requirements primarily through existing cash on hand, net cash provided by rental activities, refinancing of existing debt, distributions from joint ventures and/or asset dispositions. We expect to meet our long-term capital requirements through net cash provided by operating activities, borrowings under our revolving credit facility (if available), refinancing of existing debt or through other available investment and financing activities, including the contribution of existing wholly-owned assets to joint ventures (partial sell-down of equity interests in wholly-owned assets), asset dispositions and/or additional secured or unsecured debt financings. In January 2015, we completed the sale of our Clifford Center property, located in Honolulu, Hawaii, to an unaffiliated third party. The net proceeds from the sale of the Clifford Center property, after repaying the related mortgage loans and transaction-related expenses, were approximately $2.1 million. We may also consider strategic alternatives, including a sale, merger, other business combination or recapitalization, of the Company. In January 2016, we engaged Eastdil Secured to assist in the potential sale, financing or recapitalization of our remaining wholly-owned properties, but there can be no assurance that this engagement will result in a transaction.\nWhile we may be able to anticipate and plan for certain liquidity needs, there may be unexpected increases in uses of cash that are beyond our control and which would affect our financial condition and results of operations. For example, we may be required to comply with new laws or regulations that cause us to incur unanticipated capital expenditures for our properties, thereby increasing our liquidity needs. Even if there are no material changes to our anticipated liquidity requirements, our sources of liquidity may be fewer than, and the funds available from such sources may be less than, anticipated or needed. While we believe that access to future sources of significant cash will be challenging, we believe that we will have access to some of the liquidity sources identified above, and that those sources will be sufficient to meet our near-term liquidity needs.\nActual and Potential Sources of Liquidity\nListed below are our actual and potential sources of liquidity in the near term:\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Unrestricted and restricted cash on hand;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Net cash flow generated from operations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Refinancing of existing debt;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Distributions from joint ventures; and/or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Asset dispositions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese sources are essential to our short-term liquidity and financial position, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully access them. If we are unable to generate adequate cash from these sources, we will have liquidity-related problems and may be exposed to significant risks. For a further discussion of such risks, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d\nUnrestricted and restricted cash on hand\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $3.8 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents. In addition, we had restricted cash balances of $4.5 million. A summary of our restricted cash reserves is as follows (in thousands):\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax, insurance and other working capital reserves\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,907\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leasing and capital expenditure reserves\n</td> <td>505\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ground lease reserves\n</td> <td>1,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Collateral accounts\n</td> <td>528\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total restricted cash\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe ground lease, leasing and capital expenditure, tax, insurance and other working capital reserves are held in restricted accounts by our lenders in accordance with the terms of our mortgage loans. These restricted cash accounts are expected to fund (1) anticipated leasing expenditures (primarily commissions and tenant improvement costs) for existing and prospective tenants, (2) non-recurring discretionary capital expenditures, (3) payments for properties subject to ground leases, and (4) property taxes and insurance. The collateral accounts are held by our lenders under our other obligations.\nNet cash flow generated from operations\nOur cash flows from operations depend significantly on market rents and the ability of our tenants to make rental payments. While we believe the diversity and high credit quality of our tenants help mitigate the risk of a significant interruption of our cash flows from operations, the challenging Honolulu office market conditions that we are continuing to experience, the potential for an increase in interest rates, or the possibility of a downturn or return to recessionary conditions could adversely impact our operating cash flows. Competition to attract and retain high credit-quality tenants remains intense. At the same time, a significant number of our leases at our properties are scheduled to expire over the next several years, and the capital requirements necessary to maintain our current occupancy levels, including payment of leasing commissions, tenant concessions, and anticipated leasing expenditures, could increase. As such, we will continue to closely monitor our tenant renewals, rental rates, competitive market conditions and our cash flows.\nRefinancing of existing debt\nThe mortgage loans secured by each of our wholly-owned properties are scheduled to mature in 2016. As our debt matures, our principal payment obligations present significant near-term cash requirements. We may not be able to successfully extend, refinance or repay our debt depending on a number of factors, including property valuations, availability of credit, lending standards and economic conditions. Furthermore, as discussed below under Asset dispositions,\u201d we have agreed that until March 19, 2018, we will not prepay or defease any mortgage indebtedness secured by these properties, other than in connection with a concurrent refinancing with non-recourse mortgage debt of an equal or greater amount and subject to certain other restrictions. Although these restrictions do not prevent us from refinancing this debt, they limit our flexibility with respect to certain financing options and, as a result, we may be unable to access certain capital resources that would otherwise be available to us. We do not currently have any committed financing sources available to refinance our debt as it matures. If we are unable to successfully extend or refinance any of these loans, we may be unable to retain our ownership of the property secured by such loan.\nIn addition, our revolving credit facility and promissory notes payable to certain current and former affiliates are scheduled to mature on December 31, 2016.\nDistributions from joint ventures\nWe are currently partners with third parties in three joint ventures, holding two office properties, comprising four buildings, and a sports club associated with one of the office properties. Distributions from our joint ventures depend significantly on our joint ventures' ability to generate positive cash flow from their rental operations or the sale of one or\nmore office properties or buildings held by our joint ventures. Our joint ventures' ability to successfully manage the operations or identify, negotiate and close sale transactions on acceptable terms or at all is uncertain.\nAsset dispositions\nIn the near term or longer term, we may seek to raise additional capital by selling some or all of our existing wholly-owned assets, but we have a limited number of assets remaining that could be sold to generate net cash proceeds and our ability to do so on acceptable terms or at all is highly uncertain. Moreover, a sale of any of our wholly-owned properties that would not provide continued tax deferral to POP Venture, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company controlled by Mr. Shidler, which we refer to as Venture, is contractually restricted until March 19, 2018. These restrictions on the sale of such properties may prevent us from selling the properties or may adversely impact the terms available to us upon a disposition. In addition, we have agreed that, until March 19, 2018, we will not prepay or defease any mortgage indebtedness of such properties, other than in connection with a concurrent refinancing with non-recourse mortgage debt of an equal or greater amount and subject to certain other restrictions. Furthermore, if any such sale or defeasance is foreseeable, we are required to notify Venture and to cooperate with it in considering strategies to defer or mitigate the recognition of gain under the Code. These contractual obligations may limit our future operating flexibility and compel us to take actions or enter into transactions that we otherwise would not undertake. If we fail to comply with any of these requirements, we may be liable for a make-whole cash payment to Venture, the cost of which could be material and could adversely affect our liquidity.\nAs a result of the sale of our First Insurance Center property in June 2012, certain contract parties holding ownership interests in the contributor of First Insurance claimed they were entitled to a make-whole cash payment under tax protection agreements relating to the property. In February 2014, we issued subordinated promissory notes in the aggregate amount of $8.3 million in settlement of the majority of such claims, and paid cash settlements totaling approximately $0.4 million in settlement of the remainder of such claims. Each party receiving a promissory note or cash payment released us from any other claims under the tax protection agreements arising out of the sale of the First Insurance Center property and the foreclosure of our Sorrento Technology Center property in January 2012, as applicable. See Indebtedness - Subordinated Promissory Notes\u201d below for additional information regarding the terms of these promissory notes.\nIn December 2014, we entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement to sell our fee and leasehold interest in our Clifford Center property, located in Honolulu, Hawaii, to an unaffiliated third party buyer. We completed the sale in January 2015 for aggregate consideration of $8.9 million. We believe that no tax indemnity liability will arise under the tax protection agreements in connection with this sale because the sale of the Clifford Center property resulted in a tax loss.\nActual and Potential Uses of Liquidity\nThe following are the actual and potential uses of our cash in the near term. There may be other uses of our cash that are unexpected (and that are not identified below):\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Property operating and corporate expenses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Capital expenditures (including building and tenant improvements and leasing commissions);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Debt service and financing costs; and/or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Dividends to stockholders and distributions to limited partners of our Operating Partnership.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProperty operating and corporate expenses\nWe are focused on ensuring our properties are operating as efficiently as possible. We have taken steps to identify opportunities to reduce discretionary operating costs wherever possible and at the same time maintaining the quality of our buildings and the integrity of our management services. We have no employees and rely upon our advisor to provide substantially all of our day-to-day management. We believe that Shidler Pacific Advisors can provide adequate personnel resources, at lower cost to us, for our current and prospective business. Effective January 1, 2015, Shidler Pacific Advisors agreed to reduce the corporate management fee payable by us from $0.21 million per quarter to $0.18 million per quarter.\nCapital expenditures (including building and tenant improvements and leasing commissions)\nCapital expenditures fluctuate in any given period, subject to the nature, extent and timing of improvements required to maintain our properties. Leasing costs also fluctuate in any given period, depending upon such factors as the type of property, the term of the lease, the type of lease and overall market conditions. Our costs for capital expenditures and leasing fall into two categories: (1) amounts that we are contractually obligated to spend and (2) discretionary amounts. As of December 31, 2015, we were obligated to spend $3.0 million in capital expenditures and leasing costs through 2016.\nThe following table summarizes tenant improvement and leasing commission costs related to new and renewed leases of our wholly-owned properties:\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>New Leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Renewed Leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Leases\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Square feet(1)\n</td> <td>61,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>170,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>232,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant improvement costs per square foot(2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23.59\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6.92\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11.36\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leasing commission costs per square foot\n</td> <td>8.48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.86\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.83\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total tenant improvement and leasing commission costs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32.07\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11.78\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17.19\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n___________________________\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Excludes Clifford Center property which was sold in January 2015, right-to-use leases and month-to-month storage leases.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Based on the negotiated tenant improvement cost budget at the time of lease execution, which may be incurred in a subsequent year and different than actual costs incurred.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDebt service and financing costs\nAs of December 31, 2015, our total consolidated debt (which includes our mortgage and other loans with a carrying value of $290.9 million and our unsecured promissory notes with a carrying value of $29.4 million) was $320.3 million, with a weighted average interest rate of 5.78% and a weighted average remaining term of 0.78 years. See Indebtedness\u201d below for additional information with respect to our consolidated debt.\nAs discussed above, our obligations with respect to our mortgage debt scheduled to mature in 2016 present significant near-term cash requirements. Even if we are successful in extending or refinancing these loans, we could be required to pay down principal, fund additional reserve amounts and pay certain fees to, and expenses of, the applicable lenders in connection with any extension or refinancing. These fees and cash flow restrictions could be significant and could affect our ability to fund our other liquidity uses.\nIn May 2013, we agreed to provide short-term financing in the total amount of $0.5 million to one of our unconsolidated joint ventures. As of March 31, 2014, we had funded $0.4 million of this amount. No amounts were advanced in the second and third quarters of 2014. This loan bore interest at the annual compounded rate of 12% and was originally scheduled to mature at the earlier of April 30, 2014 or the sale or disposition of one of the properties included in the portfolio of the joint venture. In April 2014, we agreed to extend the maturity date of the loan from April 30, 2014 to the earlier of September 1, 2014 or the full repayment or discharge of the senior loans secured by the joint venture's properties. In September 2014, we were notified by our unconsolidated joint venture that it would not timely repay the loan, including the accrued interest. As a result, we recorded an allowance for bad debt for the outstanding loan balance, including interest, which amounted to approximately $0.4 million as of September 30, 2014. In November 2014, the joint venture sold its portfolio of properties and repaid the loan and accrued interest in full.\nDividends to stockholders and distributions to limited partners of our Operating Partnership\nBecause we conduct substantially all of our operations through our Operating Partnership, our ability to pay dividends depends almost entirely on distributions received on our interests in our Operating Partnership, the payment of which depends in turn on our ability to operate profitably and generate cash flow from our operations. Our ability to pay dividends to holders of our Class A Common Stock depends on our Operating Partnership's ability first to satisfy its obligations to its\ncreditors and preferred unitholders (including us with respect to the outstanding Senior Common Units of our Operating Partnership, and then to the holder of the outstanding Preferred Units of our Operating Partnership) and then to make distributions to us with respect to our general partnership interest. Our Operating Partnership may not make distributions to the holders of its outstanding Common Units (including us with respect to our general partnership interest) unless full cumulative distributions have been paid on its outstanding Senior Common Units and Preferred Units, and we may not pay dividends on our Class A Common Stock unless full cumulative dividends have been paid on our outstanding Senior Common Stock.\nWe did not declare a dividend on our Class A Common Stock during 2015 or 2014, and do not currently expect to declare a dividend on our Class A Common Stock in 2016. Furthermore, our Operating Partnership did not pay a distribution with respect to its outstanding Preferred Units or Common Units during 2015 or 2014, and does not expect to do so for 2016. As noted above, unless full cumulative distributions have been paid on the outstanding Senior Common Units and Preferred Units, our Operating Partnership may not pay a distribution on its outstanding Common Units (including us with respect to our general partnership interest), which effectively means that we will be unable to declare dividends on our Class A Common Stock unless and until all cumulative dividends and distributions have been paid with respect to the Senior Common Stock and the Preferred Units.\nFor each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we paid an aggregate of $0.9 million in cash dividends to holders of our Senior Common Stock, representing an amount equal to half the dividends accruing for such periods at the stated annualized rate of 7.25% of the original issue price of $10.00 per share. Dividends declared for each month during such periods were paid on or about the 15th day of the following month. We believe that paying these dividends at less than the full stated annualized rate is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders as it preserves a greater amount of our cash in order to fund required leasing and capital improvements for our properties with the goal of maximizing the value of our properties. The difference between the stated dividend and the paid dividend on our outstanding shares of Senior Common Stock will accrue until paid in full, and amounted to $2.4 million in aggregate as of December 31, 2015. Our board of directors has authorized daily dividends on the Senior Common Stock at half the stated annualized rate through May 2016.\nAmounts accumulated for distribution to stockholders and Operating Partnership unit holders are invested primarily in interest-bearing accounts which are consistent with our intention to maintain our qualification as a REIT. At December 31, 2015, the cumulative unpaid distributions attributable to Preferred Units were $11.4 million, which we do not anticipate to pay in 2016.\nWe cannot provide any assurance as to when, or if, we will pay the accrued dividends on the Senior Common Stock or resume the payment of dividends at the full stated annualized rate, or if we will continue to pay dividends on the Senior Common Stock at half the stated annualized rate or at all. Any dividends or other distributions we pay in the future will depend upon our legal and contractual restrictions, including the provisions of the Senior Common Stock, as well as actual results of operations, economic conditions, debt service requirements and other factors. Our actual results of operations will be affected by a number of factors, including the revenue we receive from our properties, our operating expenses, interest expense, the ability of our tenants to meet their obligations and unanticipated expenditures. For a further discussion of such risks, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d\nIndebtedness\nMortgage and Other Loans\nThe following table sets forth information relating to the material borrowings with respect to our properties and our revolving line of credit as of December 31, 2015.

See Revolving Line of Credit\u201d below.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevolving Line of Credit\nWe are party to a Credit Agreement (the FHB Credit Facility\u201d) with First Hawaiian Bank (the Lender\u201d) which provides us with a revolving line of credit in the maximum principal amount of $25.0 million and has a maturity date of December 31, 2016. Amounts borrowed under the FHB Credit Facility bear interest at a fluctuating annual rate equal to the effective rate of interest paid by the Lender on time certificates of deposit, plus 1.00%. We are permitted to use the proceeds of the line of credit for working capital and general corporate purposes, consistent with our real estate operations and for such other purposes as the Lender may approve. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had outstanding borrowings of $25.0 million under the FHB Credit Facility.\nAs security for the FHB Credit Facility, as amended, Shidler Equities L.P., a Hawaii limited partnership controlled by Mr. Shidler ( Shidler LP\u201d), has pledged to the Lender a certificate of deposit in the principal amount of $25.0 million. As a condition to this pledge, the Operating Partnership and Shidler LP entered into an indemnification agreement pursuant to which the Operating Partnership agreed to indemnify Shidler LP from any losses, damages, costs and expenses incurred by Shidler LP in connection with the pledge. In addition, to the extent that all or any portion of the certificate of deposit is withdrawn by the Lender and applied to the payment of principal, interest and/or charges under the FHB Credit Facility, the Operating Partnership agreed to pay to Shidler LP interest on the withdrawn amount at a rate of 7.0% per annum from the date of the withdrawal until the date of repayment in full by the Operating Partnership to Shidler LP. Pursuant to this\nindemnification agreement, as amended, the Operating Partnership also agreed to pay to Shidler LP an annual fee of 2.0% of the entire $25.0 million principal amount of the certificate of deposit.\nThe FHB Credit Facility contains various customary covenants, including covenants relating to disclosure of financial and other information to the Lender, maintenance and performance of our material contracts, our maintenance of adequate insurance, payment of the Lender's fees and expenses, and other customary terms and conditions.\nSubordinated Promissory Notes\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had promissory notes payable by the Operating Partnership to certain current and former affiliates in the aggregate outstanding principal amounts of $29.4 million.\nIn 2008, we issued $21.1 million of promissory notes as consideration for having funded certain capital improvements prior to the completion of our formation transactions and upon the exercise of an option granted to us by Venture and its affiliates as part of our formation transactions in 2008. The promissory notes accrue interest at a rate of 7%, per annum, with interest payable quarterly, subject to the Operating Partnership's right to defer the payment of interest for any or all periods until the date of maturity. The promissory notes were originally scheduled to mature on various dates commencing on March 19, 2013 through August 31, 2013, but the Operating Partnership elected to extend maturity for one additional year. The maturity date of the promissory notes has subsequently been extended to December 31, 2016.\nIn February 2014, we issued to certain current and former affiliates additional promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $8.3 million to settle claims under tax protection agreements relating to the sale of our First Insurance Center property in 2012. See Tax Protection Arrangements\u201d in Note 11 for additional information. These promissory notes accrue interest at a rate of 5% per annum, with interest payable quarterly, subject to the Operating Partnership's right to defer the payment of interest for any or all periods until the date of maturity, and were originally scheduled to mature on December 31, 2015. The maturity date of these promissory notes has subsequently been extended to December 31, 2016.\nThe maturity of the Operating Partnership's promissory notes will accelerate upon the occurrence of an underwritten public offering of at least $75 million of the Company's common stock, the sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets or the merger or consolidation of the Company with another entity, and specific to the promissory notes issued in February 2014, under certain circumstances in the event that the Operating Partnership has fully satisfied or is released from liability under its indemnification agreement with Shidler LP relating to the security pledged by Shidler LP in support of the FHB Credit Facility. The promissory notes are unsecured obligations of the Operating Partnership and are subordinated to borrowings under the FHB Credit Facility and our indemnification obligations to Shidler LP in connection with its pledge in support of the FHB Credit Facility.\nFor the period from March 20, 2008 through December 31, 2015, interest payments on these unsecured notes payable have been deferred with the exception of $0.3 million which was related to the notes exchanged for shares of common stock in 2009. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, $15.6 million and $12.8 million, respectively, of accrued interest attributable to these promissory notes is included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe mortgage debt that we maintain for our wholly-owned properties is typically property-specific debt that is non-recourse to our Operating Partnership, except for customary recourse carve-outs for borrower misconduct and environmental liabilities. The recourse liability for borrower misconduct and environmental liabilities was guaranteed by Mr. Reynolds. Our Operating Partnership has agreed to indemnify Mr. Reynolds to the extent of his guaranty liability. This debt strategy isolates mortgage liabilities in separate, stand-alone entities, allowing us to have only our property-specific equity investment at risk, except to the extent of the recourse carve-outs. In management's judgment, it would be remote for us to incur any material liability under these indemnities that would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nInflation\nWe are exposed to inflation risk, as income from long-term leases is the primary source of our cash flows from operations. Because the majority of our leases require tenants to pay most operating expenses, including real estate taxes, utilities, insurance, and increases in common area maintenance expenses, we do not believe our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation is material. Furthermore, the majority of our existing leases contain contractual annual rental rate increases, which will at least partially offset the effect of inflation on our operating results.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto that appear in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Historical results set forth in the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 and this Section should not be taken as indicative of our future operations.\nNote Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nOur disclosure and analysis in this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act\u201d), which include information relating to future events, future financial performance, strategies, expectations, risks and uncertainties.

As of December 31, 2015, we owned three office properties, comprising 1.2 million rentable square feet, and were partners with third parties in three joint ventures holding two office properties, comprising four buildings and 0.8 million rentable square feet, and a sports club associated with our City Square property in Phoenix, Arizona. Our ownership interest percentage in each of these joint ventures is 5.0%. As of December 31, 2015, our property portfolio included office buildings in Honolulu and Phoenix.\nOur advisor is Shidler Pacific Advisors, LLC ( Shidler Pacific Advisors\u201d), an entity that is owned and controlled by Jay H. Shidler ( Mr. Shidler\u201d), our Chairman of the Board. Lawrence J. Taff, our President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, also serves as President of Shidler Pacific Advisors. Shidler Pacific Advisors is responsible for the day-to-day operation and management of the Company, including management of our wholly-owned properties.\nWe maintain a website at www.pacificofficeproperties.com. The information on or accessible through our website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Copies of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to such reports are available without charge on our website or upon request to us.

We also post or otherwise make available on our website from time to time other information that may be of interest to our investors.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThis discussion and analysis of the historical financial condition and results of operations is based upon the accompanying consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses in the reporting period. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates and assumptions. Summarized below are those accounting policies that require material subjective or complex judgments and that have the most significant impact on financial conditions and results of operations. These estimates have been evaluated on an ongoing basis, based upon\ninformation currently available and on various assumptions that management believes are reasonable as of the date hereof. In addition, other companies in similar businesses may use different estimation policies and methodologies, which may impact the comparability of the results of operations and financial conditions to those of other companies.\nInvestments in Real Estate. We account for acquisitions of real estate utilizing the purchase method and, accordingly, the results of operations of acquired properties are included in our results of operations from the respective dates of acquisition.\nInvestments in real estate properties are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation, amortization and impairment. Our wholly-owned properties, all of which were contributed to us at the time of our formation transactions in 2008, are stated at their historical net cost basis in an amount attributable to the ownership interests in such properties owned by Mr. Shidler prior to the formation transactions. Additions to land, buildings and improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment and construction in progress are recorded at cost.\nTransaction costs related to acquisitions are expensed. Costs associated with developing space for its intended use are capitalized and amortized over their estimated useful lives, commencing at the later of the improvement completion date or the lease commencement date.\nEstimates of future cash flows and other valuation techniques are used to allocate the acquisition cost of acquired properties among land, buildings and improvements, and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities such as amounts related to in-place at-market leases, acquired below-market leases, and acquired above- and below-market ground leases.\nThe fair values of real estate assets acquired are determined on an as-if-vacant\u201d basis. The as-if-vacant\u201d fair value is allocated to land, and where applicable, buildings, tenant improvements and equipment based on comparable sales and other relevant information obtained in connection with the acquisition of the property.\nFair value is assigned to below-market leases based on the difference between (a) the contractual amounts to be paid by the tenant based on the existing lease and (b) management's estimate of current market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, over the remaining terms of the in-place leases. Capitalized below-market lease amounts are reflected in Acquired below-market leases, net,\u201d in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are amortized as an increase in rental revenue over the remaining initial non-cancellable lease terms plus the terms of any below-market fixed rate renewal options that are considered bargain renewal options. If a tenant vacates its space prior to the contractual termination of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease, any unamortized balance, net of the security deposit, of the related intangible is written off.\nFair value is also assigned to tenant relationships. Capitalized tenant relationship amounts are included in Intangible assets, net\u201d in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are amortized to Depreciation and amortization\u201d in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Amounts are amortized over the remaining terms of the respective leases even if a tenant vacates prior to the contractual termination of the lease. An adjustment to tenant relationship amounts occurs should the property experience an impairment loss.\nThe aggregate value of other acquired intangible assets consists of acquired in-place leases. The fair value allocated to acquired in-place leases consists of a variety of components including, but not necessarily limited to: (a) the value associated with avoiding the cost of originating the acquired in-place lease (i.e. the market cost to execute a lease, including leasing commissions and legal fees, if any); (b) the value associated with lost revenue related to tenant reimbursable operating costs estimated to be incurred during the assumed lease-up period (i.e. real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses); (c) the value associated with lost rental revenue from existing leases during the assumed lease-up period; and (d) the value associated with any other inducements to secure a tenant lease. The value assigned to acquired in-place leases is amortized over the remaining lives of the related leases.\nWe record the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired (including identified intangible assets) and liabilities assumed as goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as a reporting unit on an annual basis, during the fourth quarter of each calendar year, or more frequently, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. See Goodwill\u201d below. An impairment loss for an asset group is allocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a pro-rata basis using the relative\ncarrying amounts of those assets, except that the loss allocated to an individual long-lived asset shall not reduce the carrying amount of that asset below its fair value. A description of our testing policy is set forth in Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\u201d below.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets. In accordance with the provisions of the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets Subsections of Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 360, Property, Plant and Equipment, we assess the potential for impairment of our long-lived assets, including real estate properties, whenever events occur or a change in circumstances indicate that the recorded carrying value might not be fully recoverable. Indicators of potential impairment include significant decreases in occupancy levels and/or rental rates or a change in strategy that results in a decreased holding period. We determine whether impairment in value has occurred by comparing the estimated future cash flows, undiscounted and excluding interest, expected from the use and eventual disposition of the asset to its carrying value. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, the real estate or intangible carrying value is reduced to fair value and impairment loss is recognized. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value, less costs to sell.\nNo impairment charges for our wholly-owned properties were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $0.5 million on our Clifford Center property as a result of the property's fair value, net of costs to sell, being below its current carrying value, in connection with the anticipated sale of the property, which was completed in January 2015. The non-cash impairment charges are included in Loss from discontinued operations\u201d on the consolidated statement of operations.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures. Our investments in joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method of accounting because we exercise significant influence over, but do not control, our joint ventures. Our joint venture partners have substantive participating rights, including approval of and participation in setting operating budgets. Accordingly, we have determined that the equity method of accounting is appropriate for our investments in joint ventures.\nInvestments in unconsolidated joint ventures are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently adjusted for our proportionate equity in the net income or net loss of the joint ventures, contributions made to, or distributions received from, the joint ventures and other adjustments. We record distributions of operating profit from our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures as part of cash flows from operating activities and distributions related to a capital transaction, such as a refinancing transaction or sale, as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nWe evaluate all investments in accordance with the guidance of FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-17, Consolidations (Topic 810), Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest Entities, which requires ongoing assessments of the investments to determine whether or not they are variable interest entities ( VIEs\u201d) and if they are VIEs, whether or not we are determined to be the primary beneficiary. We would consolidate a VIE if it is determined that we are the primary beneficiary. We use qualitative analyses to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Consideration of various factors could include, but is not limited to, the purpose and design of the VIE, risks that the VIE was designed to create and pass through, the form of our ownership interest, our representation of the entity's governing body, the size and seniority of our investment, our ability to participate in policy making decisions, and the rights of the other investors to participate in the decision making process and/or liquidate the venture, if applicable. We currently do not hold any investments in VIEs.\nImpairment of Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures. Our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures is subject to a periodic impairment review and is considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. An investment in an unconsolidated joint venture that we identify as having an indicator of impairment is subject to further analysis to determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired, in which case we write down the investment to its estimated fair value.\nNo impairment charges were recorded in our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures for the year ended December 31, 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $0.9 million to write off our investment in the POP San Diego joint venture due to uncertainty surrounding its recoverability. The charge is included in Equity in net (loss) earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures\u201d on the consolidated statement of operations.\nDiscontinued Operations. The revenue, expenses, impairment and/or gain on sale of operating properties that meet the applicable criteria of FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360), Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity are reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations. A gain on sale, if any, is recognized in the period the property is disposed of.\nIn determining whether to report the results of operations, impairment and/or gain on sale of operating properties as discontinued operations, we evaluate whether the property that has been disposed of by sale, disposed of other than by sale or is classified as held for sale represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on our operations and financial results. A strategic shift could include the disposal of a major geographical area, a major line of business, a major equity method investment or other major parts of an entity.\nWe classify properties as held for sale when certain criteria set forth in the Long-Lived Assets Classified as Held for Sale Subsections of FASB ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment, are met, including when we receive cash deposits towards the purchase of our properties. At that time, we present the non-cash assets and liabilities of the property held for sale separately in our consolidated balance sheet. We cease recording depreciation and amortization expense at the time a property is classified as held for sale. Properties held for sale are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or their estimated fair value, less estimated costs to sell. In the event that a property classified as held for sale no longer meets the criteria for held for sale classification, the property is reclassified as held for use at the lower of the fair value or the depreciated basis as if the property had continued to be used. As of December 31, 2014, the Clifford Center property was classified as held for sale. In January 2015, we completed the sale of the Clifford Center property, and accordingly, the associated assets and liabilities had been removed from our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 and the results of its operations before the sale, including post-closing activities since the sale, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 are included in Discontinued operations\u201d in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nGoodwill. We record the excess cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired (including identified intangible assets) and liabilities assumed as goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter of each calendar year, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that a possible impairment has occurred. The assessment of impairment involves a two-step process whereby an initial assessment for potential impairment is performed, followed by a measurement of the amount of impairment, if any. Impairment testing is performed using the fair value approach, which requires the use of estimates and judgment, at the reporting unit\u201d level. A reporting unit is the operating segment, or a business that is one level below the operating segment if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management at that level. The reporting unit's fair value is calculated as the discounted future cash flows based on management's best estimate of the applicable capitalization and discount rates. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. An impairment charge is recognized as a charge against income equal to the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied value on the date of the impairment. Factors that may cause goodwill to be impaired include, but may not be limited to, a sustained decline in our stock price and the occurrence, or sustained existence, of adverse economic conditions or decreased cash flow from our properties.\nWe consider our wholly-owned properties one reporting unit due to similar geographic and economic characteristics. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, goodwill of our wholly-owned properties amounted to $37.7 million and $39.1 million, respectively. We wrote off approximately $1.4 million of goodwill associated with the sale of the Clifford Center property in January 2015.\nRevenue Recognition. The following four criteria must be met before we recognize revenue and gains:\n \u2022 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; \n \u2022 the delivery has occurred or services rendered; \n \u2022 the fee is fixed and determinable; and \n \u2022 collectability is reasonably assured. \nAll of our tenant leases are classified as operating leases. For all leases with scheduled rent increases or other adjustments, minimum rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases. Straight-line rent receivable represents rental revenue recognized on a straight-line basis in excess of billed rents and this amount is included in Deferred\nrents\u201d on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The straight line rent adjustment included in Rental revenues\u201d in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations was $0.02 million and ($0.01) million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Reimbursements from tenants for real estate taxes, excise taxes and other recoverable operating expenses are recognized as revenues in the period the applicable costs are incurred.\nCapitalized below-market lease amounts are amortized as an increase to rental revenue over the remaining initial non-cancellable lease terms plus the terms of any below-market fixed rate renewal options that are considered bargain renewal options.\nWe have leased space to certain tenants under non-cancellable operating leases, which provide for percentage rents based upon tenant revenues. Percentage rental income is recorded in Rental revenues\u201d in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nRental revenue from parking operations and month-to-month leases or leases with no scheduled rent increases or other adjustments is recognized on a monthly basis when earned.\nLease termination fees, which are included in Other\u201d revenue of the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, are recognized when the related leases are canceled and we have no continuing obligation to provide services to such former tenants.\nOther\u201d revenue on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations generally includes income incidental to our operations and is recognized when earned.\nTenant Receivables. Tenant receivables are recorded and carried at the amount billable per the applicable lease agreement, less any allowance for doubtful accounts. An allowance for doubtful accounts is made when collection of the full amounts is no longer considered probable. Tenant receivables are included in Rents and other receivables, net,\u201d in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. If a tenant fails to make contractual payments beyond any allowance, we may recognize bad debt expense in future periods equal to the amount of unpaid rent. We take into consideration factors including historical termination, default activity and current economic conditions to evaluate the level of reserve necessary. We had an allowance for doubtful accounts of $0.3 million and $0.2 million, as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nWe had a total of $1.8 million and $1.7 million of lease security available in security deposits, as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nIncome Taxes. We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we currently distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders. Also, at least 95% of gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources. We intend to adhere to these requirements and maintain our REIT status. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on taxable income that we distribute currently to our stockholders. However, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and property, and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income, if any. Management believes that we have distributed and will continue to distribute a sufficient majority of our taxable income, if any, in the form of dividends and distributions to our stockholders and unit holders. Accordingly, we have not recognized any provision for income taxes.\nThe Company is subject to the provisions of FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes which prescribes a more-likely-than-not threshold for the financial statement recognition of uncertain tax positions. ASC 740 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. On a quarterly basis, the Company evaluates the need for income tax accruals in accordance with ASC 740.\nNon-Controlling Interests. We account for non-controlling interests in accordance with FASB ASC 810, Consolidation. In accordance with FASB ASC 810, we report non-controlling interests in subsidiaries within equity in the consolidated financial statements, but separate from the parent stockholders' equity. Net income attributable to non-controlling interests is presented as a reduction from net income in calculating net income available to common stockholders on the statement of operations. Acquisitions or dispositions of non-controlling interests that do not result in a change of control are accounted\nfor as equity transactions. In addition, FASB ASC 810 requires that a parent company recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated upon a change in control. In accordance with FASB ASC 480-10, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, non-controlling interests that are determined to be redeemable are carried at their redemption value as of the balance sheet date and reported as temporary equity. We periodically evaluate individual non-controlling interests for the ability to continue to recognize the non-controlling interest as permanent equity in the consolidated balance sheets. Any non-controlling interest that fails to qualify as permanent equity will be reclassified as temporary equity and adjusted to the greater of (a) the carrying amount, or (b) its redemption value as of the end of the period in which the determination is made, the resulting adjustment is recorded in the consolidated statement of operations. See Note 12 for a more detailed discussion.\nResults of Operations\nOur results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 include the results of our wholly-owned properties (Waterfront Plaza, Davies Pacific Center and Pan Am Building) and our equity in the net earnings (loss) of our unconsolidated joint ventures. Discontinued operations reflects the net results of operations of the Clifford Center property, which was sold in January 2015. The impact on our results of operations from sales of unconsolidated joint venture properties during these periods was not material.\nOverview\nAs of December 31, 2015, our wholly-owned properties were 88.0% leased, with 136,236 square feet available, under a total of 327 leases. As of that date, 16.0% of our leased square footage was scheduled to expire during 2016 and another 12.6% of our leased square footage was scheduled to expire during 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our wholly-owned properties were 85.0% leased, with 178,295 square feet available, under a total of 349 leases. As of that date, 14.9% of our leased square footage was scheduled to expire during 2015 and another 12.5% of our leased square footage was scheduled to expire during 2016.\nThe changes in vacant space for our wholly-owned properties for the period from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015 are shown below:\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Rentable Square Feet\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vacant space available at December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>178,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sale of Clifford Center property\n</td> <td>(24,901\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leases expired on December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>2,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expired or terminated during the period\n</td> <td>222,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Square footage adjustments and exclusions(1)\n</td> <td>(9,205\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total space available for lease\n</td> <td>368,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New leases\n</td> <td>61,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Renewed leases\n</td> <td>170,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total space leased during the period\n</td> <td>232,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vacant space available at December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>136,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n___________________________\n (1) Includes adjustments for remeasured square footage, right-to-use leases and month-to-month storage leases. \nWe receive income primarily from rental revenue (including tenant reimbursements) from our office properties and, to a lesser extent, from our parking revenues. Our office properties are typically leased to tenants with good credit for terms ranging from two to 20 years. We perform credit evaluations on new tenants by requesting and reviewing their financial statements and recent tax returns. During the terms of our leases, we monitor the credit quality of our tenants by reviewing the timeliness of their lease payments. In addition, we may review financial statements, operating statements and/or performance of other financial covenants as allowed for under their lease.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2015 to\nthe year ended December 31, 2014 (in thousands)\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rental\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant reimbursements\n</td> <td>16,732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(488\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Parking\n</td> <td>6,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>706\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(410\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(58.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>44,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rental property operating\n</td> <td>25,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(920\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>1,684\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>10,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(391\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest\n</td> <td>20,581\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expenses\n</td> <td>58,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59,789\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,094\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from continuing operations before equity in net earnings (loss) of unconsolidated joint ventures\n</td> <td>(14,581\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15,669\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in net earnings (loss) of unconsolidated joint ventures\n</td> <td>497\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,147\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,644\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(143.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from continuing operations\n</td> <td>(14,084\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16,816\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from discontinued operations\n</td> <td>(180\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(536\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(66.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(14,264\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(17,352\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues\nRental revenue. Total rental revenue increased by $0.6 million, or 3.1%, primarily due to increases in rental revenues at Pan Am Building for a negotiated lease incentive for a tenant in the prior year period ($0.2 million), a tenant being in holdover in the current year period ($0.1 million) and a tenant who expanded its lease ($0.1 million) and at Waterfront Plaza as a result of write-offs of deferred rent ($0.2 million) related to tenants who vacated their leased premises in the prior year period and additional deferred rent related to a significant new tenant in the current year period ($0.2 million), partially offset by a decrease in rental revenues at Davies Pacific Center related to a a tenant who vacated its leased premises in the prior year ($0.2 million).\nTenant reimbursements. Total tenant reimbursements decreased by $0.5 million, or 2.8%, primarily due to decreases in tenant recoveries for common area maintenance expenses at Davies Pacific Center ($0.3 million) and electricity reimbursements at Waterfront Plaza ($0.2 million) compared to the prior year.\nParking revenue. Total parking revenue increased by $0.3 million, or 4.4%, primarily due to increased parking rates at Waterfront Plaza.\nOther revenue. Total other revenue decreased by $0.4 million, or 58.1%, primarily due to a decrease in termination fees ($0.2 million) that arose from a significant Waterfront Plaza tenant who vacated its leased premises in the prior year period and the related write-off of the tenant's lease obligations ($0.2 million).\nExpenses\nRental property operating expenses. Total rental property operating expenses decreased by $0.9 million, or 3.5%, primarily due to decreases in utility expenses, primarily resulting from lower electricity rates, at Davies Pacific Center ($0.4 million), Pan Am Building ($0.3 million) and Waterfront Plaza ($0.8 million) compared to the prior year period, partially\noffset by increases in miscellaneous repairs and maintenance at Davies Pacific Center ($0.1 million), air conditioning repairs at Pan Am Building ($0.1 million) and bad debt expense at Waterfront Plaza ($0.2 million) and at Pan Am Building ($0.1 million) and consulting costs at Waterfront Plaza ($0.1 million) compared to the prior year period.\nGeneral and administrative expense. Total general and administrative expense decreased by an insignificant amount compared to the prior year.\nDepreciation and amortization expense. Total depreciation and amortization expense decreased by $0.4 million, or 3.5%, primarily due to a decrease in depreciation expenses at Davies Pacific Center ($0.3 million) and at Pan Am Building ($0.1 million) as a result of assets being fully depreciated.\nInterest expense. Total interest expense increased by $0.2 million, or 1.1%, primarily due to an increase in interest attributable to additional unsecured notes payable to current and former related parties issued in February 2014.\nEquity in net earnings (loss) of unconsolidated joint ventures\nEquity in net earnings (loss) of unconsolidated joint ventures increased by $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase is primarily attributable to our share of losses in, and the subsequent write-off of, our investment in the POP San Diego joint venture in the prior year period ($1.0 million) and an increase in earnings from our joint venture which sold the Valencia Corporate Center property in September 2015 ($0.7 million), partially offset by a decrease in earnings received from one of our joint ventures which was dissolved in the prior year period ($0.1 million).\nLoss from discontinued operations\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, discontinued operations reflects the net results of operations of the Clifford Center property prior to its sale in January 2015, as well as post-closing activities since the sale. For the year ended December 31, 2014, discontinued operations reflects the net results of operations of the Clifford Center property.\nCash Flows\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $0.05 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily the result of a decrease in rental operating expense payments as compared to the prior year period.\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily the result of net proceeds from the sale of our Clifford Center property in January 2015 ($8.6 million), a decrease in capital expenditures from the prior year period ($1.6 million) and a distribution from one of our joint ventures which sold the Valencia Corporate Center property in September 2015 ($0.7 million), partially offset by the repayment of interim financing by an unconsolidated joint venture ($0.4 million) in November 2014 and an increase in leasing commissions ($0.1 million) compared to the prior year period.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to the repayment of mortgage notes payable related to the Clifford Center property as a result of the sale of the property in January 2015.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, fund and maintain our assets and operations, make distributions to our stockholders and other general business needs. In order to qualify as a REIT, we must distribute to our stockholders, each calendar year, at least 90% of our REIT taxable income. As discussed further below, however, we did not declare dividends on our Class A Common Stock during fiscal 2015 and 2014, and we do not currently expect to declare dividends on our Class A Common Stock during fiscal 2016.\nOur business is capital intensive and our ability to maintain our operations depends on our cash flow from operations and our ability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms. Our primary focus is to preserve and generate cash.\nWe are working to address challenges to our liquidity position, particularly with respect to mortgage debt on each of our wholly-owned properties that is scheduled to mature in 2016. We do not currently have any committed financing sources available to refinance our debt as it matures. If we are unable to repay, extend or refinance our existing mortgage debt, we may be forced to give back one or more of these assets to the relevant mortgage lenders.\nWe expect to meet our short-term liquidity and capital requirements primarily through existing cash on hand, net cash provided by rental activities, refinancing of existing debt, distributions from joint ventures and/or asset dispositions. We expect to meet our long-term capital requirements through net cash provided by operating activities, borrowings under our revolving credit facility (if available), refinancing of existing debt or through other available investment and financing activities, including the contribution of existing wholly-owned assets to joint ventures (partial sell-down of equity interests in wholly-owned assets), asset dispositions and/or additional secured or unsecured debt financings. In January 2015, we completed the sale of our Clifford Center property, located in Honolulu, Hawaii, to an unaffiliated third party. The net proceeds from the sale of the Clifford Center property, after repaying the related mortgage loans and transaction-related expenses, were approximately $2.1 million. We may also consider strategic alternatives, including a sale, merger, other business combination or recapitalization, of the Company. In January 2016, we engaged Eastdil Secured to assist in the potential sale, financing or recapitalization of our remaining wholly-owned properties, but there can be no assurance that this engagement will result in a transaction.\nWhile we may be able to anticipate and plan for certain liquidity needs, there may be unexpected increases in uses of cash that are beyond our control and which would affect our financial condition and results of operations. For example, we may be required to comply with new laws or regulations that cause us to incur unanticipated capital expenditures for our properties, thereby increasing our liquidity needs. Even if there are no material changes to our anticipated liquidity requirements, our sources of liquidity may be fewer than, and the funds available from such sources may be less than, anticipated or needed. While we believe that access to future sources of significant cash will be challenging, we believe that we will have access to some of the liquidity sources identified above, and that those sources will be sufficient to meet our near-term liquidity needs.\nActual and Potential Sources of Liquidity\nListed below are our actual and potential sources of liquidity in the near term:\n \u2022 Unrestricted and restricted cash on hand; \n \u2022 Net cash flow generated from operations; \n \u2022 Refinancing of existing debt; \n \u2022 Distributions from joint ventures; and/or \n \u2022 Asset dispositions. \nThese sources are essential to our short-term liquidity and financial position, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully access them. If we are unable to generate adequate cash from these sources, we will have liquidity-related problems and may be exposed to significant risks. For a further discussion of such risks, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d\nUnrestricted and restricted cash on hand\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $3.8 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents. In addition, we had restricted cash balances of $4.5 million. A summary of our restricted cash reserves is as follows (in thousands):\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax, insurance and other working capital reserves\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,907\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leasing and capital expenditure reserves\n</td> <td>505\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ground lease reserves\n</td> <td>1,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Collateral accounts\n</td> <td>528\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total restricted cash\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe ground lease, leasing and capital expenditure, tax, insurance and other working capital reserves are held in restricted accounts by our lenders in accordance with the terms of our mortgage loans. These restricted cash accounts are expected to fund (1) anticipated leasing expenditures (primarily commissions and tenant improvement costs) for existing and prospective tenants, (2) non-recurring discretionary capital expenditures, (3) payments for properties subject to ground leases, and (4) property taxes and insurance. The collateral accounts are held by our lenders under our other obligations.\nNet cash flow generated from operations\nOur cash flows from operations depend significantly on market rents and the ability of our tenants to make rental payments. While we believe the diversity and high credit quality of our tenants help mitigate the risk of a significant interruption of our cash flows from operations, the challenging Honolulu office market conditions that we are continuing to experience, the potential for an increase in interest rates, or the possibility of a downturn or return to recessionary conditions could adversely impact our operating cash flows. Competition to attract and retain high credit-quality tenants remains intense. At the same time, a significant number of our leases at our properties are scheduled to expire over the next several years, and the capital requirements necessary to maintain our current occupancy levels, including payment of leasing commissions, tenant concessions, and anticipated leasing expenditures, could increase. As such, we will continue to closely monitor our tenant renewals, rental rates, competitive market conditions and our cash flows.\nRefinancing of existing debt\nThe mortgage loans secured by each of our wholly-owned properties are scheduled to mature in 2016. As our debt matures, our principal payment obligations present significant near-term cash requirements. We may not be able to successfully extend, refinance or repay our debt depending on a number of factors, including property valuations, availability of credit, lending standards and economic conditions. Furthermore, as discussed below under Asset dispositions,\u201d we have agreed that until March 19, 2018, we will not prepay or defease any mortgage indebtedness secured by these properties, other than in connection with a concurrent refinancing with non-recourse mortgage debt of an equal or greater amount and subject to certain other restrictions. Although these restrictions do not prevent us from refinancing this debt, they limit our flexibility with respect to certain financing options and, as a result, we may be unable to access certain capital resources that would otherwise be available to us. We do not currently have any committed financing sources available to refinance our debt as it matures. If we are unable to successfully extend or refinance any of these loans, we may be unable to retain our ownership of the property secured by such loan.\nIn addition, our revolving credit facility and promissory notes payable to certain current and former affiliates are scheduled to mature on December 31, 2016.\nDistributions from joint ventures\nWe are currently partners with third parties in three joint ventures, holding two office properties, comprising four buildings, and a sports club associated with one of the office properties. Distributions from our joint ventures depend significantly on our joint ventures' ability to generate positive cash flow from their rental operations or the sale of one or\nmore office properties or buildings held by our joint ventures. Our joint ventures' ability to successfully manage the operations or identify, negotiate and close sale transactions on acceptable terms or at all is uncertain.\nAsset dispositions\nIn the near term or longer term, we may seek to raise additional capital by selling some or all of our existing wholly-owned assets, but we have a limited number of assets remaining that could be sold to generate net cash proceeds and our ability to do so on acceptable terms or at all is highly uncertain. Moreover, a sale of any of our wholly-owned properties that would not provide continued tax deferral to POP Venture, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company controlled by Mr. Shidler, which we refer to as Venture, is contractually restricted until March 19, 2018. These restrictions on the sale of such properties may prevent us from selling the properties or may adversely impact the terms available to us upon a disposition. In addition, we have agreed that, until March 19, 2018, we will not prepay or defease any mortgage indebtedness of such properties, other than in connection with a concurrent refinancing with non-recourse mortgage debt of an equal or greater amount and subject to certain other restrictions. Furthermore, if any such sale or defeasance is foreseeable, we are required to notify Venture and to cooperate with it in considering strategies to defer or mitigate the recognition of gain under the Code. These contractual obligations may limit our future operating flexibility and compel us to take actions or enter into transactions that we otherwise would not undertake. If we fail to comply with any of these requirements, we may be liable for a make-whole cash payment to Venture, the cost of which could be material and could adversely affect our liquidity.\nAs a result of the sale of our First Insurance Center property in June 2012, certain contract parties holding ownership interests in the contributor of First Insurance claimed they were entitled to a make-whole cash payment under tax protection agreements relating to the property. In February 2014, we issued subordinated promissory notes in the aggregate amount of $8.3 million in settlement of the majority of such claims, and paid cash settlements totaling approximately $0.4 million in settlement of the remainder of such claims. Each party receiving a promissory note or cash payment released us from any other claims under the tax protection agreements arising out of the sale of the First Insurance Center property and the foreclosure of our Sorrento Technology Center property in January 2012, as applicable. See Indebtedness - Subordinated Promissory Notes\u201d below for additional information regarding the terms of these promissory notes.\nIn December 2014, we entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement to sell our fee and leasehold interest in our Clifford Center property, located in Honolulu, Hawaii, to an unaffiliated third party buyer. We completed the sale in January 2015 for aggregate consideration of $8.9 million. We believe that no tax indemnity liability will arise under the tax protection agreements in connection with this sale because the sale of the Clifford Center property resulted in a tax loss.\nActual and Potential Uses of Liquidity\nThe following are the actual and potential uses of our cash in the near term. There may be other uses of our cash that are unexpected (and that are not identified below):\n \u2022 Property operating and corporate expenses; \n \u2022 Capital expenditures (including building and tenant improvements and leasing commissions); \n \u2022 Debt service and financing costs; and/or \n \u2022 Dividends to stockholders and distributions to limited partners of our Operating Partnership. \nProperty operating and corporate expenses\nWe are focused on ensuring our properties are operating as efficiently as possible. We have taken steps to identify opportunities to reduce discretionary operating costs wherever possible and at the same time maintaining the quality of our buildings and the integrity of our management services. We have no employees and rely upon our advisor to provide substantially all of our day-to-day management. We believe that Shidler Pacific Advisors can provide adequate personnel resources, at lower cost to us, for our current and prospective business. Effective January 1, 2015, Shidler Pacific Advisors agreed to reduce the corporate management fee payable by us from $0.21 million per quarter to $0.18 million per quarter.\nCapital expenditures (including building and tenant improvements and leasing commissions)\nCapital expenditures fluctuate in any given period, subject to the nature, extent and timing of improvements required to maintain our properties. Leasing costs also fluctuate in any given period, depending upon such factors as the type of property, the term of the lease, the type of lease and overall market conditions. Our costs for capital expenditures and leasing fall into two categories: (1) amounts that we are contractually obligated to spend and (2) discretionary amounts. As of December 31, 2015, we were obligated to spend $3.0 million in capital expenditures and leasing costs through 2016.\nThe following table summarizes tenant improvement and leasing commission costs related to new and renewed leases of our wholly-owned properties:\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>New Leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Renewed Leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Leases\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Square feet(1)\n</td> <td>61,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>170,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>232,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant improvement costs per square foot(2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23.59\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6.92\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11.36\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leasing commission costs per square foot\n</td> <td>8.48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.86\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.83\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total tenant improvement and leasing commission costs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32.07\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11.78\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17.19\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n___________________________\n (1) Excludes Clifford Center property which was sold in January 2015, right-to-use leases and month-to-month storage leases. \n (2) Based on the negotiated tenant improvement cost budget at the time of lease execution, which may be incurred in a subsequent year and different than actual costs incurred. \nDebt service and financing costs\nAs of December 31, 2015, our total consolidated debt (which includes our mortgage and other loans with a carrying value of $290.9 million and our unsecured promissory notes with a carrying value of $29.4 million) was $320.3 million, with a weighted average interest rate of 5.78% and a weighted average remaining term of 0.78 years. See Indebtedness\u201d below for additional information with respect to our consolidated debt.\nAs discussed above, our obligations with respect to our mortgage debt scheduled to mature in 2016 present significant near-term cash requirements. Even if we are successful in extending or refinancing these loans, we could be required to pay down principal, fund additional reserve amounts and pay certain fees to, and expenses of, the applicable lenders in connection with any extension or refinancing. These fees and cash flow restrictions could be significant and could affect our ability to fund our other liquidity uses.\nIn May 2013, we agreed to provide short-term financing in the total amount of $0.5 million to one of our unconsolidated joint ventures. As of March 31, 2014, we had funded $0.4 million of this amount. No amounts were advanced in the second and third quarters of 2014. This loan bore interest at the annual compounded rate of 12% and was originally scheduled to mature at the earlier of April 30, 2014 or the sale or disposition of one of the properties included in the portfolio of the joint venture. In April 2014, we agreed to extend the maturity date of the loan from April 30, 2014 to the earlier of September 1, 2014 or the full repayment or discharge of the senior loans secured by the joint venture's properties. In September 2014, we were notified by our unconsolidated joint venture that it would not timely repay the loan, including the accrued interest. As a result, we recorded an allowance for bad debt for the outstanding loan balance, including interest, which amounted to approximately $0.4 million as of September 30, 2014. In November 2014, the joint venture sold its portfolio of properties and repaid the loan and accrued interest in full.\nDividends to stockholders and distributions to limited partners of our Operating Partnership\nBecause we conduct substantially all of our operations through our Operating Partnership, our ability to pay dividends depends almost entirely on distributions received on our interests in our Operating Partnership, the payment of which depends in turn on our ability to operate profitably and generate cash flow from our operations. Our ability to pay dividends to holders of our Class A Common Stock depends on our Operating Partnership's ability first to satisfy its obligations to its\ncreditors and preferred unitholders (including us with respect to the outstanding Senior Common Units of our Operating Partnership, and then to the holder of the outstanding Preferred Units of our Operating Partnership) and then to make distributions to us with respect to our general partnership interest. Our Operating Partnership may not make distributions to the holders of its outstanding Common Units (including us with respect to our general partnership interest) unless full cumulative distributions have been paid on its outstanding Senior Common Units and Preferred Units, and we may not pay dividends on our Class A Common Stock unless full cumulative dividends have been paid on our outstanding Senior Common Stock.\nWe did not declare a dividend on our Class A Common Stock during 2015 or 2014, and do not currently expect to declare a dividend on our Class A Common Stock in 2016. Furthermore, our Operating Partnership did not pay a distribution with respect to its outstanding Preferred Units or Common Units during 2015 or 2014, and does not expect to do so for 2016. As noted above, unless full cumulative distributions have been paid on the outstanding Senior Common Units and Preferred Units, our Operating Partnership may not pay a distribution on its outstanding Common Units (including us with respect to our general partnership interest), which effectively means that we will be unable to declare dividends on our Class A Common Stock unless and until all cumulative dividends and distributions have been paid with respect to the Senior Common Stock and the Preferred Units.\nFor each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we paid an aggregate of $0.9 million in cash dividends to holders of our Senior Common Stock, representing an amount equal to half the dividends accruing for such periods at the stated annualized rate of 7.25% of the original issue price of $10.00 per share. Dividends declared for each month during such periods were paid on or about the 15th day of the following month. We believe that paying these dividends at less than the full stated annualized rate is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders as it preserves a greater amount of our cash in order to fund required leasing and capital improvements for our properties with the goal of maximizing the value of our properties. The difference between the stated dividend and the paid dividend on our outstanding shares of Senior Common Stock will accrue until paid in full, and amounted to $2.4 million in aggregate as of December 31, 2015. Our board of directors has authorized daily dividends on the Senior Common Stock at half the stated annualized rate through May 2016.\nAmounts accumulated for distribution to stockholders and Operating Partnership unit holders are invested primarily in interest-bearing accounts which are consistent with our intention to maintain our qualification as a REIT. At December 31, 2015, the cumulative unpaid distributions attributable to Preferred Units were $11.4 million, which we do not anticipate to pay in 2016.\nWe cannot provide any assurance as to when, or if, we will pay the accrued dividends on the Senior Common Stock or resume the payment of dividends at the full stated annualized rate, or if we will continue to pay dividends on the Senior Common Stock at half the stated annualized rate or at all. Any dividends or other distributions we pay in the future will depend upon our legal and contractual restrictions, including the provisions of the Senior Common Stock, as well as actual results of operations, economic conditions, debt service requirements and other factors. Our actual results of operations will be affected by a number of factors, including the revenue we receive from our properties, our operating expenses, interest expense, the ability of our tenants to meet their obligations and unanticipated expenditures. For a further discussion of such risks, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d\nIndebtedness\nMortgage and Other Loans\nThe following table sets forth information relating to the material borrowings with respect to our properties and our revolving line of credit as of December 31, 2015.

No premium is due after August 11, 2016. \n (5) The revolving line of credit matures on December 31, 2016. See Revolving Line of Credit\u201d below. \nRevolving Line of Credit\nWe are party to a Credit Agreement (the FHB Credit Facility\u201d) with First Hawaiian Bank (the Lender\u201d) which provides us with a revolving line of credit in the maximum principal amount of $25.0 million and has a maturity date of December 31, 2016. Amounts borrowed under the FHB Credit Facility bear interest at a fluctuating annual rate equal to the effective rate of interest paid by the Lender on time certificates of deposit, plus 1.00%. We are permitted to use the proceeds of the line of credit for working capital and general corporate purposes, consistent with our real estate operations and for such other purposes as the Lender may approve. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had outstanding borrowings of $25.0 million under the FHB Credit Facility.\nAs security for the FHB Credit Facility, as amended, Shidler Equities L.P., a Hawaii limited partnership controlled by Mr. Shidler ( Shidler LP\u201d), has pledged to the Lender a certificate of deposit in the principal amount of $25.0 million. As a condition to this pledge, the Operating Partnership and Shidler LP entered into an indemnification agreement pursuant to which the Operating Partnership agreed to indemnify Shidler LP from any losses, damages, costs and expenses incurred by Shidler LP in connection with the pledge. In addition, to the extent that all or any portion of the certificate of deposit is withdrawn by the Lender and applied to the payment of principal, interest and/or charges under the FHB Credit Facility, the Operating Partnership agreed to pay to Shidler LP interest on the withdrawn amount at a rate of 7.0% per annum from the date of the withdrawal until the date of repayment in full by the Operating Partnership to Shidler LP. Pursuant to this\nindemnification agreement, as amended, the Operating Partnership also agreed to pay to Shidler LP an annual fee of 2.0% of the entire $25.0 million principal amount of the certificate of deposit.\nThe FHB Credit Facility contains various customary covenants, including covenants relating to disclosure of financial and other information to the Lender, maintenance and performance of our material contracts, our maintenance of adequate insurance, payment of the Lender's fees and expenses, and other customary terms and conditions.\nSubordinated Promissory Notes\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had promissory notes payable by the Operating Partnership to certain current and former affiliates in the aggregate outstanding principal amounts of $29.4 million.\nIn 2008, we issued $21.1 million of promissory notes as consideration for having funded certain capital improvements prior to the completion of our formation transactions and upon the exercise of an option granted to us by Venture and its affiliates as part of our formation transactions in 2008. The promissory notes accrue interest at a rate of 7%, per annum, with interest payable quarterly, subject to the Operating Partnership's right to defer the payment of interest for any or all periods until the date of maturity. The promissory notes were originally scheduled to mature on various dates commencing on March 19, 2013 through August 31, 2013, but the Operating Partnership elected to extend maturity for one additional year. The maturity date of the promissory notes has subsequently been extended to December 31, 2016.\nIn February 2014, we issued to certain current and former affiliates additional promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $8.3 million to settle claims under tax protection agreements relating to the sale of our First Insurance Center property in 2012. See Tax Protection Arrangements\u201d in Note 11 for additional information. These promissory notes accrue interest at a rate of 5% per annum, with interest payable quarterly, subject to the Operating Partnership's right to defer the payment of interest for any or all periods until the date of maturity, and were originally scheduled to mature on December 31, 2015. The maturity date of these promissory notes has subsequently been extended to December 31, 2016.\nThe maturity of the Operating Partnership's promissory notes will accelerate upon the occurrence of an underwritten public offering of at least $75 million of the Company's common stock, the sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets or the merger or consolidation of the Company with another entity, and specific to the promissory notes issued in February 2014, under certain circumstances in the event that the Operating Partnership has fully satisfied or is released from liability under its indemnification agreement with Shidler LP relating to the security pledged by Shidler LP in support of the FHB Credit Facility. The promissory notes are unsecured obligations of the Operating Partnership and are subordinated to borrowings under the FHB Credit Facility and our indemnification obligations to Shidler LP in connection with its pledge in support of the FHB Credit Facility.\nFor the period from March 20, 2008 through December 31, 2015, interest payments on these unsecured notes payable have been deferred with the exception of $0.3 million which was related to the notes exchanged for shares of common stock in 2009. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, $15.6 million and $12.8 million, respectively, of accrued interest attributable to these promissory notes is included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe mortgage debt that we maintain for our wholly-owned properties is typically property-specific debt that is non-recourse to our Operating Partnership, except for customary recourse carve-outs for borrower misconduct and environmental liabilities. The recourse liability for borrower misconduct and environmental liabilities was guaranteed by Mr. Reynolds. Our Operating Partnership has agreed to indemnify Mr. Reynolds to the extent of his guaranty liability. This debt strategy isolates mortgage liabilities in separate, stand-alone entities, allowing us to have only our property-specific equity investment at risk, except to the extent of the recourse carve-outs. In management's judgment, it would be remote for us to incur any material liability under these indemnities that would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nInflation\nWe are exposed to inflation risk, as income from long-term leases is the primary source of our cash flows from operations. Because the majority of our leases require tenants to pay most operating expenses, including real estate taxes, utilities, insurance, and increases in common area maintenance expenses, we do not believe our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation is material. Furthermore, the majority of our existing leases contain contractual annual rental rate increases, which will at least partially offset the effect of inflation on our operating results.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto that appear in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Historical results set forth in the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 and this Section should not be taken as indicative of our future operations.\nNote Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nOur disclosure and analysis in this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act\u201d), which include information relating to future events, future financial performance, strategies, expectations, risks and uncertainties.

As of December 31, 2015, we owned three office properties, comprising 1.2 million rentable square feet, and were partners with third parties in three joint ventures holding two office properties, comprising four buildings and 0.8 million rentable square feet, and a sports club associated with our City Square property in Phoenix, Arizona. Our ownership interest percentage in each of these joint ventures is 5.0%. As of December 31, 2015, our property portfolio included office buildings in Honolulu and Phoenix.\nOur advisor is Shidler Pacific Advisors, LLC ( Shidler Pacific Advisors\u201d), an entity that is owned and controlled by Jay H. Shidler ( Mr. Shidler\u201d), our Chairman of the Board. Lawrence J. Taff, our President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, also serves as President of Shidler Pacific Advisors. Shidler Pacific Advisors is responsible for the day-to-day operation and management of the Company, including management of our wholly-owned properties.\nWe maintain a website at www.pacificofficeproperties.com. The information on or accessible through our website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Copies of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to such reports are available without charge on our website or upon request to us.

Amendments to, or waivers from, our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that apply to our executive officers will be posted to our website. We also post or otherwise make available on our website from time to time other information that may be of interest to our investors.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThis discussion and analysis of the historical financial condition and results of operations is based upon the accompanying consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses in the reporting period. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates and assumptions. Summarized below are those accounting policies that require material subjective or complex judgments and that have the most significant impact on financial conditions and results of operations. These estimates have been evaluated on an ongoing basis, based upon\ninformation currently available and on various assumptions that management believes are reasonable as of the date hereof. In addition, other companies in similar businesses may use different estimation policies and methodologies, which may impact the comparability of the results of operations and financial conditions to those of other companies.\nInvestments in Real Estate. We account for acquisitions of real estate utilizing the purchase method and, accordingly, the results of operations of acquired properties are included in our results of operations from the respective dates of acquisition.\nInvestments in real estate properties are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation, amortization and impairment. Our wholly-owned properties, all of which were contributed to us at the time of our formation transactions in 2008, are stated at their historical net cost basis in an amount attributable to the ownership interests in such properties owned by Mr. Shidler prior to the formation transactions. Additions to land, buildings and improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment and construction in progress are recorded at cost.\nTransaction costs related to acquisitions are expensed. Costs associated with developing space for its intended use are capitalized and amortized over their estimated useful lives, commencing at the later of the improvement completion date or the lease commencement date.\nEstimates of future cash flows and other valuation techniques are used to allocate the acquisition cost of acquired properties among land, buildings and improvements, and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities such as amounts related to in-place at-market leases, acquired below-market leases, and acquired above- and below-market ground leases.\nThe fair values of real estate assets acquired are determined on an as-if-vacant\u201d basis. The as-if-vacant\u201d fair value is allocated to land, and where applicable, buildings, tenant improvements and equipment based on comparable sales and other relevant information obtained in connection with the acquisition of the property.\nFair value is assigned to below-market leases based on the difference between (a) the contractual amounts to be paid by the tenant based on the existing lease and (b) management's estimate of current market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, over the remaining terms of the in-place leases. Capitalized below-market lease amounts are reflected in Acquired below-market leases, net,\u201d in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are amortized as an increase in rental revenue over the remaining initial non-cancellable lease terms plus the terms of any below-market fixed rate renewal options that are considered bargain renewal options. If a tenant vacates its space prior to the contractual termination of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease, any unamortized balance, net of the security deposit, of the related intangible is written off.\nFair value is also assigned to tenant relationships. Capitalized tenant relationship amounts are included in Intangible assets, net\u201d in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are amortized to Depreciation and amortization\u201d in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Amounts are amortized over the remaining terms of the respective leases even if a tenant vacates prior to the contractual termination of the lease. An adjustment to tenant relationship amounts occurs should the property experience an impairment loss.\nThe aggregate value of other acquired intangible assets consists of acquired in-place leases. The fair value allocated to acquired in-place leases consists of a variety of components including, but not necessarily limited to: (a) the value associated with avoiding the cost of originating the acquired in-place lease (i.e. the market cost to execute a lease, including leasing commissions and legal fees, if any); (b) the value associated with lost revenue related to tenant reimbursable operating costs estimated to be incurred during the assumed lease-up period (i.e. real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses); (c) the value associated with lost rental revenue from existing leases during the assumed lease-up period; and (d) the value associated with any other inducements to secure a tenant lease. The value assigned to acquired in-place leases is amortized over the remaining lives of the related leases.\nWe record the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired (including identified intangible assets) and liabilities assumed as goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as a reporting unit on an annual basis, during the fourth quarter of each calendar year, or more frequently, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. See Goodwill\u201d below. An impairment loss for an asset group is allocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a pro-rata basis using the relative\ncarrying amounts of those assets, except that the loss allocated to an individual long-lived asset shall not reduce the carrying amount of that asset below its fair value. A description of our testing policy is set forth in Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\u201d below.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets. In accordance with the provisions of the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets Subsections of Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 360, Property, Plant and Equipment, we assess the potential for impairment of our long-lived assets, including real estate properties, whenever events occur or a change in circumstances indicate that the recorded carrying value might not be fully recoverable. Indicators of potential impairment include significant decreases in occupancy levels and/or rental rates or a change in strategy that results in a decreased holding period. We determine whether impairment in value has occurred by comparing the estimated future cash flows, undiscounted and excluding interest, expected from the use and eventual disposition of the asset to its carrying value. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, the real estate or intangible carrying value is reduced to fair value and impairment loss is recognized. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value, less costs to sell.\nNo impairment charges for our wholly-owned properties were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $0.5 million on our Clifford Center property as a result of the property's fair value, net of costs to sell, being below its current carrying value, in connection with the anticipated sale of the property, which was completed in January 2015. The non-cash impairment charges are included in Loss from discontinued operations\u201d on the consolidated statement of operations.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures. Our investments in joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method of accounting because we exercise significant influence over, but do not control, our joint ventures. Our joint venture partners have substantive participating rights, including approval of and participation in setting operating budgets. Accordingly, we have determined that the equity method of accounting is appropriate for our investments in joint ventures.\nInvestments in unconsolidated joint ventures are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently adjusted for our proportionate equity in the net income or net loss of the joint ventures, contributions made to, or distributions received from, the joint ventures and other adjustments. We record distributions of operating profit from our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures as part of cash flows from operating activities and distributions related to a capital transaction, such as a refinancing transaction or sale, as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nWe evaluate all investments in accordance with the guidance of FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-17, Consolidations (Topic 810), Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest Entities, which requires ongoing assessments of the investments to determine whether or not they are variable interest entities ( VIEs\u201d) and if they are VIEs, whether or not we are determined to be the primary beneficiary. We would consolidate a VIE if it is determined that we are the primary beneficiary. We use qualitative analyses to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Consideration of various factors could include, but is not limited to, the purpose and design of the VIE, risks that the VIE was designed to create and pass through, the form of our ownership interest, our representation of the entity's governing body, the size and seniority of our investment, our ability to participate in policy making decisions, and the rights of the other investors to participate in the decision making process and/or liquidate the venture, if applicable. We currently do not hold any investments in VIEs.\nImpairment of Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures. Our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures is subject to a periodic impairment review and is considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. An investment in an unconsolidated joint venture that we identify as having an indicator of impairment is subject to further analysis to determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired, in which case we write down the investment to its estimated fair value.\nNo impairment charges were recorded in our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures for the year ended December 31, 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $0.9 million to write off our investment in the POP San Diego joint venture due to uncertainty surrounding its recoverability. The charge is included in Equity in net (loss) earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures\u201d on the consolidated statement of operations.\nDiscontinued Operations. The revenue, expenses, impairment and/or gain on sale of operating properties that meet the applicable criteria of FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360), Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity are reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations. A gain on sale, if any, is recognized in the period the property is disposed of.\nIn determining whether to report the results of operations, impairment and/or gain on sale of operating properties as discontinued operations, we evaluate whether the property that has been disposed of by sale, disposed of other than by sale or is classified as held for sale represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on our operations and financial results. A strategic shift could include the disposal of a major geographical area, a major line of business, a major equity method investment or other major parts of an entity.\nWe classify properties as held for sale when certain criteria set forth in the Long-Lived Assets Classified as Held for Sale Subsections of FASB ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment, are met, including when we receive cash deposits towards the purchase of our properties. At that time, we present the non-cash assets and liabilities of the property held for sale separately in our consolidated balance sheet. We cease recording depreciation and amortization expense at the time a property is classified as held for sale. Properties held for sale are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or their estimated fair value, less estimated costs to sell. In the event that a property classified as held for sale no longer meets the criteria for held for sale classification, the property is reclassified as held for use at the lower of the fair value or the depreciated basis as if the property had continued to be used. As of December 31, 2014, the Clifford Center property was classified as held for sale. In January 2015, we completed the sale of the Clifford Center property, and accordingly, the associated assets and liabilities had been removed from our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 and the results of its operations before the sale, including post-closing activities since the sale, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 are included in Discontinued operations\u201d in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nGoodwill. We record the excess cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired (including identified intangible assets) and liabilities assumed as goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter of each calendar year, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that a possible impairment has occurred. The assessment of impairment involves a two-step process whereby an initial assessment for potential impairment is performed, followed by a measurement of the amount of impairment, if any. Impairment testing is performed using the fair value approach, which requires the use of estimates and judgment, at the reporting unit\u201d level. A reporting unit is the operating segment, or a business that is one level below the operating segment if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management at that level. The reporting unit's fair value is calculated as the discounted future cash flows based on management's best estimate of the applicable capitalization and discount rates. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. An impairment charge is recognized as a charge against income equal to the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied value on the date of the impairment. Factors that may cause goodwill to be impaired include, but may not be limited to, a sustained decline in our stock price and the occurrence, or sustained existence, of adverse economic conditions or decreased cash flow from our properties.\nWe consider our wholly-owned properties one reporting unit due to similar geographic and economic characteristics. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, goodwill of our wholly-owned properties amounted to $37.7 million and $39.1 million, respectively. We wrote off approximately $1.4 million of goodwill associated with the sale of the Clifford Center property in January 2015.\nRevenue Recognition. The following four criteria must be met before we recognize revenue and gains:\n \u2022 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; \n \u2022 the delivery has occurred or services rendered; \n \u2022 the fee is fixed and determinable; and \n \u2022 collectability is reasonably assured. \nAll of our tenant leases are classified as operating leases. For all leases with scheduled rent increases or other adjustments, minimum rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases. Straight-line rent receivable represents rental revenue recognized on a straight-line basis in excess of billed rents and this amount is included in Deferred\nrents\u201d on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The straight line rent adjustment included in Rental revenues\u201d in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations was $0.02 million and ($0.01) million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Reimbursements from tenants for real estate taxes, excise taxes and other recoverable operating expenses are recognized as revenues in the period the applicable costs are incurred.\nCapitalized below-market lease amounts are amortized as an increase to rental revenue over the remaining initial non-cancellable lease terms plus the terms of any below-market fixed rate renewal options that are considered bargain renewal options.\nWe have leased space to certain tenants under non-cancellable operating leases, which provide for percentage rents based upon tenant revenues. Percentage rental income is recorded in Rental revenues\u201d in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nRental revenue from parking operations and month-to-month leases or leases with no scheduled rent increases or other adjustments is recognized on a monthly basis when earned.\nLease termination fees, which are included in Other\u201d revenue of the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, are recognized when the related leases are canceled and we have no continuing obligation to provide services to such former tenants.\nOther\u201d revenue on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations generally includes income incidental to our operations and is recognized when earned.\nTenant Receivables. Tenant receivables are recorded and carried at the amount billable per the applicable lease agreement, less any allowance for doubtful accounts. An allowance for doubtful accounts is made when collection of the full amounts is no longer considered probable. Tenant receivables are included in Rents and other receivables, net,\u201d in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. If a tenant fails to make contractual payments beyond any allowance, we may recognize bad debt expense in future periods equal to the amount of unpaid rent. We take into consideration factors including historical termination, default activity and current economic conditions to evaluate the level of reserve necessary. We had an allowance for doubtful accounts of $0.3 million and $0.2 million, as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nWe had a total of $1.8 million and $1.7 million of lease security available in security deposits, as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nIncome Taxes. We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we currently distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders. Also, at least 95% of gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources. We intend to adhere to these requirements and maintain our REIT status. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on taxable income that we distribute currently to our stockholders. However, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and property, and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income, if any. Management believes that we have distributed and will continue to distribute a sufficient majority of our taxable income, if any, in the form of dividends and distributions to our stockholders and unit holders. Accordingly, we have not recognized any provision for income taxes.\nThe Company is subject to the provisions of FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes which prescribes a more-likely-than-not threshold for the financial statement recognition of uncertain tax positions. ASC 740 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. On a quarterly basis, the Company evaluates the need for income tax accruals in accordance with ASC 740.\nNon-Controlling Interests. We account for non-controlling interests in accordance with FASB ASC 810, Consolidation. In accordance with FASB ASC 810, we report non-controlling interests in subsidiaries within equity in the consolidated financial statements, but separate from the parent stockholders' equity. Net income attributable to non-controlling interests is presented as a reduction from net income in calculating net income available to common stockholders on the statement of operations. Acquisitions or dispositions of non-controlling interests that do not result in a change of control are accounted\nfor as equity transactions. In addition, FASB ASC 810 requires that a parent company recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated upon a change in control. In accordance with FASB ASC 480-10, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, non-controlling interests that are determined to be redeemable are carried at their redemption value as of the balance sheet date and reported as temporary equity. We periodically evaluate individual non-controlling interests for the ability to continue to recognize the non-controlling interest as permanent equity in the consolidated balance sheets. Any non-controlling interest that fails to qualify as permanent equity will be reclassified as temporary equity and adjusted to the greater of (a) the carrying amount, or (b) its redemption value as of the end of the period in which the determination is made, the resulting adjustment is recorded in the consolidated statement of operations. See Note 12 for a more detailed discussion.\nResults of Operations\nOur results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 include the results of our wholly-owned properties (Waterfront Plaza, Davies Pacific Center and Pan Am Building) and our equity in the net earnings (loss) of our unconsolidated joint ventures. Discontinued operations reflects the net results of operations of the Clifford Center property, which was sold in January 2015. The impact on our results of operations from sales of unconsolidated joint venture properties during these periods was not material.\nOverview\nAs of December 31, 2015, our wholly-owned properties were 88.0% leased, with 136,236 square feet available, under a total of 327 leases. As of that date, 16.0% of our leased square footage was scheduled to expire during 2016 and another 12.6% of our leased square footage was scheduled to expire during 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our wholly-owned properties were 85.0% leased, with 178,295 square feet available, under a total of 349 leases. As of that date, 14.9% of our leased square footage was scheduled to expire during 2015 and another 12.5% of our leased square footage was scheduled to expire during 2016.\nThe changes in vacant space for our wholly-owned properties for the period from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015 are shown below:\n\n___________________________\n (1) Includes adjustments for remeasured square footage, right-to-use leases and month-to-month storage leases. \nWe receive income primarily from rental revenue (including tenant reimbursements) from our office properties and, to a lesser extent, from our parking revenues. Our office properties are typically leased to tenants with good credit for terms ranging from two to 20 years. We perform credit evaluations on new tenants by requesting and reviewing their financial statements and recent tax returns. During the terms of our leases, we monitor the credit quality of our tenants by reviewing the timeliness of their lease payments. In addition, we may review financial statements, operating statements and/or performance of other financial covenants as allowed for under their lease.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2015 to\nthe year ended December 31, 2014 (in thousands)\n\nRevenues\nRental revenue. Total rental revenue increased by $0.6 million, or 3.1%, primarily due to increases in rental revenues at Pan Am Building for a negotiated lease incentive for a tenant in the prior year period ($0.2 million), a tenant being in holdover in the current year period ($0.1 million) and a tenant who expanded its lease ($0.1 million) and at Waterfront Plaza as a result of write-offs of deferred rent ($0.2 million) related to tenants who vacated their leased premises in the prior year period and additional deferred rent related to a significant new tenant in the current year period ($0.2 million), partially offset by a decrease in rental revenues at Davies Pacific Center related to a a tenant who vacated its leased premises in the prior year ($0.2 million).\nTenant reimbursements. Total tenant reimbursements decreased by $0.5 million, or 2.8%, primarily due to decreases in tenant recoveries for common area maintenance expenses at Davies Pacific Center ($0.3 million) and electricity reimbursements at Waterfront Plaza ($0.2 million) compared to the prior year.\nParking revenue. Total parking revenue increased by $0.3 million, or 4.4%, primarily due to increased parking rates at Waterfront Plaza.\nOther revenue. Total other revenue decreased by $0.4 million, or 58.1%, primarily due to a decrease in termination fees ($0.2 million) that arose from a significant Waterfront Plaza tenant who vacated its leased premises in the prior year period and the related write-off of the tenant's lease obligations ($0.2 million).\nExpenses\nRental property operating expenses. Total rental property operating expenses decreased by $0.9 million, or 3.5%, primarily due to decreases in utility expenses, primarily resulting from lower electricity rates, at Davies Pacific Center ($0.4 million), Pan Am Building ($0.3 million) and Waterfront Plaza ($0.8 million) compared to the prior year period, partially\noffset by increases in miscellaneous repairs and maintenance at Davies Pacific Center ($0.1 million), air conditioning repairs at Pan Am Building ($0.1 million) and bad debt expense at Waterfront Plaza ($0.2 million) and at Pan Am Building ($0.1 million) and consulting costs at Waterfront Plaza ($0.1 million) compared to the prior year period.\nGeneral and administrative expense. Total general and administrative expense decreased by an insignificant amount compared to the prior year.\nDepreciation and amortization expense. Total depreciation and amortization expense decreased by $0.4 million, or 3.5%, primarily due to a decrease in depreciation expenses at Davies Pacific Center ($0.3 million) and at Pan Am Building ($0.1 million) as a result of assets being fully depreciated.\nInterest expense. Total interest expense increased by $0.2 million, or 1.1%, primarily due to an increase in interest attributable to additional unsecured notes payable to current and former related parties issued in February 2014.\nEquity in net earnings (loss) of unconsolidated joint ventures\nEquity in net earnings (loss) of unconsolidated joint ventures increased by $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase is primarily attributable to our share of losses in, and the subsequent write-off of, our investment in the POP San Diego joint venture in the prior year period ($1.0 million) and an increase in earnings from our joint venture which sold the Valencia Corporate Center property in September 2015 ($0.7 million), partially offset by a decrease in earnings received from one of our joint ventures which was dissolved in the prior year period ($0.1 million).\nLoss from discontinued operations\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, discontinued operations reflects the net results of operations of the Clifford Center property prior to its sale in January 2015, as well as post-closing activities since the sale. For the year ended December 31, 2014, discontinued operations reflects the net results of operations of the Clifford Center property.\nCash Flows\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $0.05 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily the result of a decrease in rental operating expense payments as compared to the prior year period.\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily the result of net proceeds from the sale of our Clifford Center property in January 2015 ($8.6 million), a decrease in capital expenditures from the prior year period ($1.6 million) and a distribution from one of our joint ventures which sold the Valencia Corporate Center property in September 2015 ($0.7 million), partially offset by the repayment of interim financing by an unconsolidated joint venture ($0.4 million) in November 2014 and an increase in leasing commissions ($0.1 million) compared to the prior year period.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to the repayment of mortgage notes payable related to the Clifford Center property as a result of the sale of the property in January 2015.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, fund and maintain our assets and operations, make distributions to our stockholders and other general business needs. In order to qualify as a REIT, we must distribute to our stockholders, each calendar year, at least 90% of our REIT taxable income. As discussed further below, however, we did not declare dividends on our Class A Common Stock during fiscal 2015 and 2014, and we do not currently expect to declare dividends on our Class A Common Stock during fiscal 2016.\nOur business is capital intensive and our ability to maintain our operations depends on our cash flow from operations and our ability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms. Our primary focus is to preserve and generate cash.\nWe are working to address challenges to our liquidity position, particularly with respect to mortgage debt on each of our wholly-owned properties that is scheduled to mature in 2016. We do not currently have any committed financing sources available to refinance our debt as it matures. If we are unable to repay, extend or refinance our existing mortgage debt, we may be forced to give back one or more of these assets to the relevant mortgage lenders.\nWe expect to meet our short-term liquidity and capital requirements primarily through existing cash on hand, net cash provided by rental activities, refinancing of existing debt, distributions from joint ventures and/or asset dispositions. We expect to meet our long-term capital requirements through net cash provided by operating activities, borrowings under our revolving credit facility (if available), refinancing of existing debt or through other available investment and financing activities, including the contribution of existing wholly-owned assets to joint ventures (partial sell-down of equity interests in wholly-owned assets), asset dispositions and/or additional secured or unsecured debt financings. In January 2015, we completed the sale of our Clifford Center property, located in Honolulu, Hawaii, to an unaffiliated third party. The net proceeds from the sale of the Clifford Center property, after repaying the related mortgage loans and transaction-related expenses, were approximately $2.1 million. We may also consider strategic alternatives, including a sale, merger, other business combination or recapitalization, of the Company. In January 2016, we engaged Eastdil Secured to assist in the potential sale, financing or recapitalization of our remaining wholly-owned properties, but there can be no assurance that this engagement will result in a transaction.\nWhile we may be able to anticipate and plan for certain liquidity needs, there may be unexpected increases in uses of cash that are beyond our control and which would affect our financial condition and results of operations. For example, we may be required to comply with new laws or regulations that cause us to incur unanticipated capital expenditures for our properties, thereby increasing our liquidity needs. Even if there are no material changes to our anticipated liquidity requirements, our sources of liquidity may be fewer than, and the funds available from such sources may be less than, anticipated or needed. While we believe that access to future sources of significant cash will be challenging, we believe that we will have access to some of the liquidity sources identified above, and that those sources will be sufficient to meet our near-term liquidity needs.\nActual and Potential Sources of Liquidity\nListed below are our actual and potential sources of liquidity in the near term:\n \u2022 Unrestricted and restricted cash on hand; \n \u2022 Net cash flow generated from operations; \n \u2022 Refinancing of existing debt; \n \u2022 Distributions from joint ventures; and/or \n \u2022 Asset dispositions. \nThese sources are essential to our short-term liquidity and financial position, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully access them. If we are unable to generate adequate cash from these sources, we will have liquidity-related problems and may be exposed to significant risks. For a further discussion of such risks, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d\nUnrestricted and restricted cash on hand\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $3.8 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents. In addition, we had restricted cash balances of $4.5 million. A summary of our restricted cash reserves is as follows (in thousands):\n\nThe ground lease, leasing and capital expenditure, tax, insurance and other working capital reserves are held in restricted accounts by our lenders in accordance with the terms of our mortgage loans. These restricted cash accounts are expected to fund (1) anticipated leasing expenditures (primarily commissions and tenant improvement costs) for existing and prospective tenants, (2) non-recurring discretionary capital expenditures, (3) payments for properties subject to ground leases, and (4) property taxes and insurance. The collateral accounts are held by our lenders under our other obligations.\nNet cash flow generated from operations\nOur cash flows from operations depend significantly on market rents and the ability of our tenants to make rental payments. While we believe the diversity and high credit quality of our tenants help mitigate the risk of a significant interruption of our cash flows from operations, the challenging Honolulu office market conditions that we are continuing to experience, the potential for an increase in interest rates, or the possibility of a downturn or return to recessionary conditions could adversely impact our operating cash flows. Competition to attract and retain high credit-quality tenants remains intense. At the same time, a significant number of our leases at our properties are scheduled to expire over the next several years, and the capital requirements necessary to maintain our current occupancy levels, including payment of leasing commissions, tenant concessions, and anticipated leasing expenditures, could increase. As such, we will continue to closely monitor our tenant renewals, rental rates, competitive market conditions and our cash flows.\nRefinancing of existing debt\nThe mortgage loans secured by each of our wholly-owned properties are scheduled to mature in 2016. As our debt matures, our principal payment obligations present significant near-term cash requirements. We may not be able to successfully extend, refinance or repay our debt depending on a number of factors, including property valuations, availability of credit, lending standards and economic conditions. Furthermore, as discussed below under Asset dispositions,\u201d we have agreed that until March 19, 2018, we will not prepay or defease any mortgage indebtedness secured by these properties, other than in connection with a concurrent refinancing with non-recourse mortgage debt of an equal or greater amount and subject to certain other restrictions. Although these restrictions do not prevent us from refinancing this debt, they limit our flexibility with respect to certain financing options and, as a result, we may be unable to access certain capital resources that would otherwise be available to us. We do not currently have any committed financing sources available to refinance our debt as it matures. If we are unable to successfully extend or refinance any of these loans, we may be unable to retain our ownership of the property secured by such loan.\nIn addition, our revolving credit facility and promissory notes payable to certain current and former affiliates are scheduled to mature on December 31, 2016.\nDistributions from joint ventures\nWe are currently partners with third parties in three joint ventures, holding two office properties, comprising four buildings, and a sports club associated with one of the office properties. Distributions from our joint ventures depend significantly on our joint ventures' ability to generate positive cash flow from their rental operations or the sale of one or\nmore office properties or buildings held by our joint ventures. Our joint ventures' ability to successfully manage the operations or identify, negotiate and close sale transactions on acceptable terms or at all is uncertain.\nAsset dispositions\nIn the near term or longer term, we may seek to raise additional capital by selling some or all of our existing wholly-owned assets, but we have a limited number of assets remaining that could be sold to generate net cash proceeds and our ability to do so on acceptable terms or at all is highly uncertain. Moreover, a sale of any of our wholly-owned properties that would not provide continued tax deferral to POP Venture, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company controlled by Mr. Shidler, which we refer to as Venture, is contractually restricted until March 19, 2018. These restrictions on the sale of such properties may prevent us from selling the properties or may adversely impact the terms available to us upon a disposition. In addition, we have agreed that, until March 19, 2018, we will not prepay or defease any mortgage indebtedness of such properties, other than in connection with a concurrent refinancing with non-recourse mortgage debt of an equal or greater amount and subject to certain other restrictions. Furthermore, if any such sale or defeasance is foreseeable, we are required to notify Venture and to cooperate with it in considering strategies to defer or mitigate the recognition of gain under the Code. These contractual obligations may limit our future operating flexibility and compel us to take actions or enter into transactions that we otherwise would not undertake. If we fail to comply with any of these requirements, we may be liable for a make-whole cash payment to Venture, the cost of which could be material and could adversely affect our liquidity.\nAs a result of the sale of our First Insurance Center property in June 2012, certain contract parties holding ownership interests in the contributor of First Insurance claimed they were entitled to a make-whole cash payment under tax protection agreements relating to the property. In February 2014, we issued subordinated promissory notes in the aggregate amount of $8.3 million in settlement of the majority of such claims, and paid cash settlements totaling approximately $0.4 million in settlement of the remainder of such claims. Each party receiving a promissory note or cash payment released us from any other claims under the tax protection agreements arising out of the sale of the First Insurance Center property and the foreclosure of our Sorrento Technology Center property in January 2012, as applicable. See Indebtedness - Subordinated Promissory Notes\u201d below for additional information regarding the terms of these promissory notes.\nIn December 2014, we entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement to sell our fee and leasehold interest in our Clifford Center property, located in Honolulu, Hawaii, to an unaffiliated third party buyer. We completed the sale in January 2015 for aggregate consideration of $8.9 million. We believe that no tax indemnity liability will arise under the tax protection agreements in connection with this sale because the sale of the Clifford Center property resulted in a tax loss.\nActual and Potential Uses of Liquidity\nThe following are the actual and potential uses of our cash in the near term. There may be other uses of our cash that are unexpected (and that are not identified below):\n \u2022 Property operating and corporate expenses; \n \u2022 Capital expenditures (including building and tenant improvements and leasing commissions); \n \u2022 Debt service and financing costs; and/or \n \u2022 Dividends to stockholders and distributions to limited partners of our Operating Partnership. \nProperty operating and corporate expenses\nWe are focused on ensuring our properties are operating as efficiently as possible. We have taken steps to identify opportunities to reduce discretionary operating costs wherever possible and at the same time maintaining the quality of our buildings and the integrity of our management services. We have no employees and rely upon our advisor to provide substantially all of our day-to-day management. We believe that Shidler Pacific Advisors can provide adequate personnel resources, at lower cost to us, for our current and prospective business. Effective January 1, 2015, Shidler Pacific Advisors agreed to reduce the corporate management fee payable by us from $0.21 million per quarter to $0.18 million per quarter.\nCapital expenditures (including building and tenant improvements and leasing commissions)\nCapital expenditures fluctuate in any given period, subject to the nature, extent and timing of improvements required to maintain our properties. Leasing costs also fluctuate in any given period, depending upon such factors as the type of property, the term of the lease, the type of lease and overall market conditions. Our costs for capital expenditures and leasing fall into two categories: (1) amounts that we are contractually obligated to spend and (2) discretionary amounts. As of December 31, 2015, we were obligated to spend $3.0 million in capital expenditures and leasing costs through 2016.\nThe following table summarizes tenant improvement and leasing commission costs related to new and renewed leases of our wholly-owned properties:\n\n___________________________\n (1) Excludes Clifford Center property which was sold in January 2015, right-to-use leases and month-to-month storage leases. \n (2) Based on the negotiated tenant improvement cost budget at the time of lease execution, which may be incurred in a subsequent year and different than actual costs incurred. \nDebt service and financing costs\nAs of December 31, 2015, our total consolidated debt (which includes our mortgage and other loans with a carrying value of $290.9 million and our unsecured promissory notes with a carrying value of $29.4 million) was $320.3 million, with a weighted average interest rate of 5.78% and a weighted average remaining term of 0.78 years. See Indebtedness\u201d below for additional information with respect to our consolidated debt.\nAs discussed above, our obligations with respect to our mortgage debt scheduled to mature in 2016 present significant near-term cash requirements. Even if we are successful in extending or refinancing these loans, we could be required to pay down principal, fund additional reserve amounts and pay certain fees to, and expenses of, the applicable lenders in connection with any extension or refinancing. These fees and cash flow restrictions could be significant and could affect our ability to fund our other liquidity uses.\nIn May 2013, we agreed to provide short-term financing in the total amount of $0.5 million to one of our unconsolidated joint ventures. As of March 31, 2014, we had funded $0.4 million of this amount. No amounts were advanced in the second and third quarters of 2014. This loan bore interest at the annual compounded rate of 12% and was originally scheduled to mature at the earlier of April 30, 2014 or the sale or disposition of one of the properties included in the portfolio of the joint venture. In April 2014, we agreed to extend the maturity date of the loan from April 30, 2014 to the earlier of September 1, 2014 or the full repayment or discharge of the senior loans secured by the joint venture's properties. In September 2014, we were notified by our unconsolidated joint venture that it would not timely repay the loan, including the accrued interest. As a result, we recorded an allowance for bad debt for the outstanding loan balance, including interest, which amounted to approximately $0.4 million as of September 30, 2014. In November 2014, the joint venture sold its portfolio of properties and repaid the loan and accrued interest in full.\nDividends to stockholders and distributions to limited partners of our Operating Partnership\nBecause we conduct substantially all of our operations through our Operating Partnership, our ability to pay dividends depends almost entirely on distributions received on our interests in our Operating Partnership, the payment of which depends in turn on our ability to operate profitably and generate cash flow from our operations. Our ability to pay dividends to holders of our Class A Common Stock depends on our Operating Partnership's ability first to satisfy its obligations to its\ncreditors and preferred unitholders (including us with respect to the outstanding Senior Common Units of our Operating Partnership, and then to the holder of the outstanding Preferred Units of our Operating Partnership) and then to make distributions to us with respect to our general partnership interest. Our Operating Partnership may not make distributions to the holders of its outstanding Common Units (including us with respect to our general partnership interest) unless full cumulative distributions have been paid on its outstanding Senior Common Units and Preferred Units, and we may not pay dividends on our Class A Common Stock unless full cumulative dividends have been paid on our outstanding Senior Common Stock.\nWe did not declare a dividend on our Class A Common Stock during 2015 or 2014, and do not currently expect to declare a dividend on our Class A Common Stock in 2016. Furthermore, our Operating Partnership did not pay a distribution with respect to its outstanding Preferred Units or Common Units during 2015 or 2014, and does not expect to do so for 2016. As noted above, unless full cumulative distributions have been paid on the outstanding Senior Common Units and Preferred Units, our Operating Partnership may not pay a distribution on its outstanding Common Units (including us with respect to our general partnership interest), which effectively means that we will be unable to declare dividends on our Class A Common Stock unless and until all cumulative dividends and distributions have been paid with respect to the Senior Common Stock and the Preferred Units.\nFor each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we paid an aggregate of $0.9 million in cash dividends to holders of our Senior Common Stock, representing an amount equal to half the dividends accruing for such periods at the stated annualized rate of 7.25% of the original issue price of $10.00 per share. Dividends declared for each month during such periods were paid on or about the 15th day of the following month. We believe that paying these dividends at less than the full stated annualized rate is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders as it preserves a greater amount of our cash in order to fund required leasing and capital improvements for our properties with the goal of maximizing the value of our properties. The difference between the stated dividend and the paid dividend on our outstanding shares of Senior Common Stock will accrue until paid in full, and amounted to $2.4 million in aggregate as of December 31, 2015. Our board of directors has authorized daily dividends on the Senior Common Stock at half the stated annualized rate through May 2016.\nAmounts accumulated for distribution to stockholders and Operating Partnership unit holders are invested primarily in interest-bearing accounts which are consistent with our intention to maintain our qualification as a REIT. At December 31, 2015, the cumulative unpaid distributions attributable to Preferred Units were $11.4 million, which we do not anticipate to pay in 2016.\nWe cannot provide any assurance as to when, or if, we will pay the accrued dividends on the Senior Common Stock or resume the payment of dividends at the full stated annualized rate, or if we will continue to pay dividends on the Senior Common Stock at half the stated annualized rate or at all. Any dividends or other distributions we pay in the future will depend upon our legal and contractual restrictions, including the provisions of the Senior Common Stock, as well as actual results of operations, economic conditions, debt service requirements and other factors. Our actual results of operations will be affected by a number of factors, including the revenue we receive from our properties, our operating expenses, interest expense, the ability of our tenants to meet their obligations and unanticipated expenditures. For a further discussion of such risks, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d\nIndebtedness\nMortgage and Other Loans\nThe following table sets forth information relating to the material borrowings with respect to our properties and our revolving line of credit as of December 31, 2015. Each loan requires monthly payments of interest only and balloon payments at maturity, and all dollars are reported in thousands:\n\n (1) Loan is prepayable subject to prepayment premium equal to greater of 1% of principal balance of loan or yield maintenance. No premium is due after May 11, 2016. \n (2) Loan may be prepaid subject to payment of a yield maintenance-based prepayment premium; no premium is due after June 11, 2016. Loan may also be defeased. \n (3) Loan may be prepaid subject to payment of a yield maintenance-based prepayment premium; no premium is due after June 11, 2016. \n (4) Loan is prepayable, subject to prepayment premium equal to greater of 1% of amount prepaid or yield maintenance. No premium is due after August 11, 2016. \n (5) The revolving line of credit matures on December 31, 2016. See Revolving Line of Credit\u201d below. \nRevolving Line of Credit\nWe are party to a Credit Agreement (the FHB Credit Facility\u201d) with First Hawaiian Bank (the Lender\u201d) which provides us with a revolving line of credit in the maximum principal amount of $25.0 million and has a maturity date of December 31, 2016. Amounts borrowed under the FHB Credit Facility bear interest at a fluctuating annual rate equal to the effective rate of interest paid by the Lender on time certificates of deposit, plus 1.00%. We are permitted to use the proceeds of the line of credit for working capital and general corporate purposes, consistent with our real estate operations and for such other purposes as the Lender may approve. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had outstanding borrowings of $25.0 million under the FHB Credit Facility.\nAs security for the FHB Credit Facility, as amended, Shidler Equities L.P., a Hawaii limited partnership controlled by Mr. Shidler ( Shidler LP\u201d), has pledged to the Lender a certificate of deposit in the principal amount of $25.0 million. As a condition to this pledge, the Operating Partnership and Shidler LP entered into an indemnification agreement pursuant to which the Operating Partnership agreed to indemnify Shidler LP from any losses, damages, costs and expenses incurred by Shidler LP in connection with the pledge. In addition, to the extent that all or any portion of the certificate of deposit is withdrawn by the Lender and applied to the payment of principal, interest and/or charges under the FHB Credit Facility, the Operating Partnership agreed to pay to Shidler LP interest on the withdrawn amount at a rate of 7.0% per annum from the date of the withdrawal until the date of repayment in full by the Operating Partnership to Shidler LP. Pursuant to this\nindemnification agreement, as amended, the Operating Partnership also agreed to pay to Shidler LP an annual fee of 2.0% of the entire $25.0 million principal amount of the certificate of deposit.\nThe FHB Credit Facility contains various customary covenants, including covenants relating to disclosure of financial and other information to the Lender, maintenance and performance of our material contracts, our maintenance of adequate insurance, payment of the Lender's fees and expenses, and other customary terms and conditions.\nSubordinated Promissory Notes\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had promissory notes payable by the Operating Partnership to certain current and former affiliates in the aggregate outstanding principal amounts of $29.4 million.\nIn 2008, we issued $21.1 million of promissory notes as consideration for having funded certain capital improvements prior to the completion of our formation transactions and upon the exercise of an option granted to us by Venture and its affiliates as part of our formation transactions in 2008. The promissory notes accrue interest at a rate of 7%, per annum, with interest payable quarterly, subject to the Operating Partnership's right to defer the payment of interest for any or all periods until the date of maturity. The promissory notes were originally scheduled to mature on various dates commencing on March 19, 2013 through August 31, 2013, but the Operating Partnership elected to extend maturity for one additional year. The maturity date of the promissory notes has subsequently been extended to December 31, 2016.\nIn February 2014, we issued to certain current and former affiliates additional promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $8.3 million to settle claims under tax protection agreements relating to the sale of our First Insurance Center property in 2012. See Tax Protection Arrangements\u201d in Note 11 for additional information. These promissory notes accrue interest at a rate of 5% per annum, with interest payable quarterly, subject to the Operating Partnership's right to defer the payment of interest for any or all periods until the date of maturity, and were originally scheduled to mature on December 31, 2015. The maturity date of these promissory notes has subsequently been extended to December 31, 2016.\nThe maturity of the Operating Partnership's promissory notes will accelerate upon the occurrence of an underwritten public offering of at least $75 million of the Company's common stock, the sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets or the merger or consolidation of the Company with another entity, and specific to the promissory notes issued in February 2014, under certain circumstances in the event that the Operating Partnership has fully satisfied or is released from liability under its indemnification agreement with Shidler LP relating to the security pledged by Shidler LP in support of the FHB Credit Facility. The promissory notes are unsecured obligations of the Operating Partnership and are subordinated to borrowings under the FHB Credit Facility and our indemnification obligations to Shidler LP in connection with its pledge in support of the FHB Credit Facility.\nFor the period from March 20, 2008 through December 31, 2015, interest payments on these unsecured notes payable have been deferred with the exception of $0.3 million which was related to the notes exchanged for shares of common stock in 2009. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, $15.6 million and $12.8 million, respectively, of accrued interest attributable to these promissory notes is included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe mortgage debt that we maintain for our wholly-owned properties is typically property-specific debt that is non-recourse to our Operating Partnership, except for customary recourse carve-outs for borrower misconduct and environmental liabilities. The recourse liability for borrower misconduct and environmental liabilities was guaranteed by Mr. Reynolds. Our Operating Partnership has agreed to indemnify Mr. Reynolds to the extent of his guaranty liability. This debt strategy isolates mortgage liabilities in separate, stand-alone entities, allowing us to have only our property-specific equity investment at risk, except to the extent of the recourse carve-outs. In management's judgment, it would be remote for us to incur any material liability under these indemnities that would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nInflation\nWe are exposed to inflation risk, as income from long-term leases is the primary source of our cash flows from operations. Because the majority of our leases require tenants to pay most operating expenses, including real estate taxes, utilities, insurance, and increases in common area maintenance expenses, we do not believe our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation is material. Furthermore, the majority of our existing leases contain contractual annual rental rate increases, which will at least partially offset the effect of inflation on our operating results.",

\"MD&A: ITEM 7. - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\" segment from an Annual Report on Form 10-K provides a comprehensive analysis of the company's financial situation and performance. Here is a summary:\n\n1. Introduction\nThe discussion analyzes the company's financial conditions and results based on historical consolidated financial statements, noting that historical results should not be used to predict future performance.\n\n2. Forward-Looking Statements\nThe report contains certain forward-looking statements regarding expected future financial performance and business strategies, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results may differ materially.\n\n3. Company Overview\nThe company is an externally advised Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) that owns institutional-quality office properties in Hawaii. As of December 31, 2015, the company owned three office properties and had joint venture interests in two others and a sports club.\n\n4. Critical Accounting Policies\nThe report emphasizes that the company's financial statements are prepared according to GAAP and involve estimates that have significant impacts on the financial results, such as investments in real estate, impairment of long-lived assets, investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, and revenue recognition.\n\n5. Results of Operations\nThe results of operations are based on the performance of wholly-owned properties and the equity in net earnings (loss) of unconsolidated joint ventures. There were changes in rental revenue, tenant reimbursements, parking revenue, and other income. Operating expenses underwent minor fluctuations, and there was an overall loss from continuing operations, although it reduced year-over-year.\n\n6. Cash Flows\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased slightly in 2015, while net cash provided by investing activities grew due to proceeds from a property sale and reduced capital expenditures. Net cash used in financing activities also increased primarily due to the repayment of mortgage notes payable.\n\n7. Liquidity and Capital Resources\nThe company maintains liquidity through cash on hand, rental activities, refinancing of existing debt, joint venture distributions, and asset dispositions. Dividends on the Class A Common Stock have not been declared for fiscal 2015 and 2014, and none are expected for fiscal 2016.\n\n8. Actual and Potential Sources of Liquidity\nThe company relies on unrestricted and restricted cash, net cash flow from operations, refinancing of existing debt, joint venture distributions, and asset dispositions for liquidity.\n\n9. Actual and Potential Uses of Liquidity\nCash is used for property operating and corporate expenses, capital expenditures, debt service, and dividends/distributions.\n\n10. Indebtedness\nThe company provides details on its mortgage and other loans, including principal amounts, interest rates, and maturity dates.\n\n11. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe company's mortgage debt for wholly-owned properties is non-recourse to the Operating Partnership except for certain guarantees. There's minimal risk of significant liability from these guarantees.\n\n12. Inflation\nInflation risk is mitigated through leases that pass through most operating expenses to tenants and contain annual rental rate increases.\n\nOverall, the report reflects cautious optimism about the company's future despite challenges in refinancing debts and maintaining liquidity. It also reflects reliance on stable revenue from property leases and continued efforts to manage costs and capital expenditures effectively."}
