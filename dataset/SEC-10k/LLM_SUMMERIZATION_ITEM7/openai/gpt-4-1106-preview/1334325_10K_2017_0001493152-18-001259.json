MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OPERATIONS\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe information herein contains forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical fact made herein are forward looking. In particular, the statements herein regarding industry prospects and future results of operations or financial position are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as believes,\u201d estimates,\u201d could,\u201d possibly,\u201d probably,\u201d anticipates,\u201d projects,\u201d expects,\u201d may,\u201d will,\u201d or should\u201d or other variations or similar words. No assurances can be given that the future results anticipated by the forward-looking statements will be achieved. Forward-looking statements reflect management's current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Our actual results may differ significantly from management's expectations.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, included herewith. This discussion should not be construed to imply that the results discussed herein will necessarily continue into the future, or that any conclusion reached herein will necessarily be indicative of actual operating results in the future. Such discussion represents only the best present assessment of our management.\nGeneral Overview\nWe operate two distinct business segments. Our Products Segment designs and manufactures patented real time 3D sonar solutions and other leading products for subsea applications ( Products Segment\u201d). Our Services Segment supplies engineering services to prime defense contractors ( Services Segment\u201d).\nOur products are used primarily in the underwater construction market, offshore oil and gas, offshore wind energy industry, and in the complex dredging, port security, mining and marine sciences sectors. Our customers include service providers to major oil and gas companies, law enforcement agencies, ports, mining companies, defense bodies, research institutes and universities.\nOur Services segment supplies engineering services mainly to prime defense contractors such as Raytheon and Northrop Grumman. We have long-standing relationships with prime defense contractors. We support some significant defense programs by supplying and maintaining proprietary parts through obsolescence management programs. These services provide recurring stream of revenues for our Services segment.\nHistorically, the Products Segment generated approximately 70% of our revenues. However, during the last three fiscal years prior to the 2017 period, the Products Segment has generated around 50% of our overall revenues, with the Services Segment growing at a faster pace. However, during the 2017 period, due to the new US administration's failure to approve the defense budget, many projected sales did not materialize. As a result, the Services Segment revenues fell from 50% of our overall revenues to 39% in the 2017 with the Products Segment generating 61% of revenues in the 2017 period as compared to 50% in the 2016 period. Although the Products Segment generated 61% of the overall revenues in the 2017 period, it is still adversely affected by the contraction in the oil and gas (O&G) industry. Furthermore, due to the effort by O&G companies to restructure their operations, the climate in which we sell is fiercely competitive thus impacting on revenues and gross margins.\nNevertheless, we believe that our unique and patented real time 3D solutions are a significant advancement on the current technology available in the subsea sonar imaging market due to its real time capability providing real time volumetric data of underwater targets in low or zero visibility conditions and its capability to image moving objects in the subsea environment. Furthermore, because the technology provides real time imaging of the underwater environment, it enhances safety significantly and delivers substantial productivity gains to our customers, thus reducing their costs. In addition, our real time 3D solution is emerging as the preferred solutions for subsea asset placements because of the technology's unique ability to image moving targets (such as Accropodes\u2122, X-Blocs, Antifers block placements, mattress placements, landing of installations on the seabed and the like). Due to the decline in the price of oil, many O&G companies are seeking cost effective solutions for their operations. We believe that our real time 3D solution has the potential to revolutionize the technology used in underwater operations particularly where real time visualization is required or zero or low visibility conditions prevail. We also believe that with the proliferation of underwater drones our technology has significant application for the imaging sonar defense market (which is worth billions of dollars annually) as it is the only available off the shelf technology that can image moving targets (such as underwater vehicles) in the water.\nTable 44: <table><tr><td>22 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSince introducing this product, we have made progress in getting our core real time 3D technology, the Echoscope\u00ae, adopted by a significant number of ports in the USA (the CodaOctopus\u00ae Underwater Inspection System (which integrates our Echoscope, motion sensing product and hydrographic pole) where it is used for port and harbor security. In 2015 we secured the first sale of our Underwater Inspection System to a foreign government body in East Asia and in 2016 we sold two additional full system to this body. We hope to sell additional systems into this government body as part of their technology upgrade program for the next three years.\nWe have also made progress in expanding the markets (and applications) for our real time 3D sonars. Recently, we have sold a number of systems to mining companies. Increasingly, our customers involved in offshore wind energy and renewables are adopting the technology as the primary tool for scour management, subsea cable installation and associated cable protection tasks.\nIn addition, in recent years we have started to rent our real time 3D solutions with engineering services. Given the contraction in capital expenditures budget in the O&G market, rentals are increasingly becoming an important part of the composition of the Company's revenues and these O&G operators are more prepared to utilize operational budgets. Furthermore, our rental offering generally yields a higher gross margin for the Company.\nOur business is affected by a number of factors including those set out below:\nTable 45: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>A. </td> <td>The Company's operations are split between the United States, United Kingdom, Australia and Norway. A large proportion of our revenues (approximately 58%) and costs are incurred outside of the USA with a significant part (50% of our total revenues) of that in the United Kingdom ( UK\u201d).

Furthermore, a large part of our assets is held in British Pounds while the majority of our liabilities (which comprise our senior secured debentures - see Note 8 of the audited Consolidated Financial Statements) are maintained in U.S. Dollars. In the 2017 period as compared to the same 2016 period, we realized a balance sheet gain on our assets due to a slight gain in the British Pound against the US Dollar prevailing at the balance sheet date of October 31, 2017.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported values of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported levels of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.\nBelow is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results and that may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain. A discussion of our significant accounting policies, including further discussion of the accounting policies described below, can be found in Note 2, Summary of Accounting Policies\u201d of our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue is derived from sales of underwater technologies and equipment for imaging, mapping, defense and survey applications and from the engineering services which we provide. Revenue is recognized when evidence of a contractual arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the contract price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. No right of return privileges are granted to customers after delivery.\nFor arrangements with multiple deliverables, we recognize product revenue by allocating the revenue to each deliverable based on the relative fair value of each deliverable, and recognize revenue when equipment is delivered, and for installation and other services as they are performed.\nTable 49: <table><tr><td>24 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur contracts sometimes require customer payments in advance of revenue recognition. These amounts are reflected as liabilities and recognized as revenue when the Company has fulfilled its obligations under the respective contracts.\nFor software license sales for which any services rendered are not considered essential to the functionality of the software, we recognize revenue upon delivery of the software, provided (1) there is evidence of a contractual arrangement for this, (2) collection of our fee is considered probable and (3) the fee is fixed and determinable.\nFor arrangements that are generated from time and material contracts where there is a signed agreement and approved purchase order in place that specifies the fixed hourly rate and other reimbursable costs to be billed based on material and direct labor hours incurred, revenue is recognized on these contracts based on material and direct labor hours incurred. Revenues from fixed-price contracts are recognized on the percentage-of-completion method, measured by the percentage of costs incurred (materials and direct labor hours) to date to estimated total services (materials and direct labor hours) for each contract. This method is used as expenditures for direct materials and labor hours are considered to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts. Losses on fixed-price contracts are recognized during the period in which the loss first becomes apparent based upon costs incurred to date and the estimated costs to complete as determined by experience from similar contracts. Variations from estimated contract performance could result in adjustments to operating results.\nRental Revenue is recognized monthly over the term of the rental period.\nRecoverability of Deferred Costs\nWe defer costs on projects for service revenue. Deferred costs consist primarily of direct and incremental costs to customize and install systems, as defined in individual customer contracts, including costs to acquire hardware and software from third parties and payroll costs for our employees and other third parties.\nWe recognize such costs in accordance with our revenue recognition policy by contract. For revenue recognized under the completed contract method, costs are deferred until the products are delivered, or upon completion of services or, where applicable, customer acceptance. For revenue recognized under the percentage of completion method, costs are recognized as products are delivered or services are provided in accordance with the percentage of completion calculation. For revenue recognized ratably over the term of the contract, costs are recognized ratably over the term of the contract, commencing on the date of revenue recognition. At each balance sheet date, we review deferred costs, to ensure they are ultimately recoverable. Any anticipated losses on uncompleted contracts are recognized when evidence indicates the estimated total cost of a contract exceeds its estimated total revenue.\nStock Based Compensation\nWe recognize the expense related to the fair value of stock based compensation awards within the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. We use the fair value method for equity instruments granted to non-employees and use the Black-Scholes model for measuring the fair value. The stock based fair value compensation is determined as of the date of the grant or the date at which the performance of the services is completed (measurement date) and is recognized over the periods in which the related services are rendered.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740). Under ASC 740, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the income tax effects of differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their bases for income tax reporting. The Company's differences arise principally from the use of various accelerated and modified accelerated cost recovery system for income tax purposes versus straight line depreciation used for book purposes and from the utilization of net operating loss carry-forwards.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are the amounts by which the Company's future income taxes are expected to be impacted by these differences as they reverse. Deferred tax assets are based on differences that are expected to decrease future income taxes as they reverse. Correspondingly, deferred tax liabilities are based on differences that are expected to increase future income taxes as they reverse. Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements discusses the amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and also presents the impact of significant differences between financial reporting income and taxable income.\nTable 50: <table><tr><td>25 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor income tax purposes, the Company uses the percentage of completion method of recognizing revenues on long-term contracts which is consistent with the Company's financial reporting under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets consist principally of the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired (or goodwill), customer relationships, non-compete agreements and licenses. Goodwill was allocated to our reporting units based on the original purchase price allocation. Goodwill is not amortized and is evaluated for impairment annually or more often if circumstances indicate impairment may exist. Customer relationships, non-compete agreements, patents and licenses are being amortized on a straight-line basis over periods of 2 to 10 years. The Company amortizes its limited lived intangible assets using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit. We periodically evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets and take into account events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate that impairment exists.\nThe first step of the goodwill impairment test, used to identify potential impairment, compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value, which is based on future cash flows, exceeds the carrying amount, goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, the second step must be performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. The second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. At the end of each year, we evaluate goodwill on a separate reporting unit basis to assess recoverability, and impairments, if any, are recognized in earnings. An impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nWe operate two distinct business segments. Our Marine Technology Business designs and manufactures patented real time 3D sonar solutions and other leading products for subsea applications ( Products Segment\u201d). Our Marine Engineering Business supplies engineering services to prime defense contractors ( Services Segment\u201d).\nOur Products Segment sells its products and associated services to the offshore wind energy, dredging and marine construction, marine and port security, mining including deep sea mining, marine sciences sector and oil and gas sector. This segment generated approximately 61% and 50% of our total revenues for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nOur Services Segment largely sells its services into prime and sub-prime defense contractors. This segment generated approximately 39% and 50% of our total revenues for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This segment continues to be an important part of the Group's revenues plan and, in particular, our subsidiary Coda Octopus Colmek.\nComparison of fiscal year ended October 31, 2017 ( 2017 period\u201d) to fiscal year ended October 31, 2016 ( 2016 period\u201d)\nThroughout this discussion, the 2017 period\u201d means the fiscal year ended October 31, 2017. Similarly, the 2016 period\u201d means the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016.\nSee Segment information below for a full breakout of the financial performance of each Segment for the 2017 and 2016 periods, respectively.\nThe information provided below pertains to the consolidated analysis of both segments (Products and Services) operating in our Group.\nTable 51: <table><tr><td>26 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue: Total revenues in the 2017 and 2016 periods were $18,025,173 and $21,118,319, respectively, representing a 14.6% decrease in the 2017 period.\nThe reason for the decline in our revenues during the 2017 period is the delay by the new US administration in approving defense spending (and budget). This has resulted in prime defense contractors not finalizing contracts with Coda Octopus Colmek (a part of our Services Segment) that were anticipated in our Business Plan for the 2017 period. Accordingly, during the 2017 period, revenues generated by our Services segment were $7,038,905 as compared to $10,534,178 during the 2016 period (a decline of 33.2% (See break out in Segment Analysis on page of this report)). Although these opportunities which were projected in the 2017 period have not gone away, this segment continues to be impacted by the uncertainty around the timescales for the approval of the defense budget by the new administration.\nOur outlook for this segment in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 is that its results will be significantly impacted by this ongoing delay, thus resulting in an overall decline in the Group's revenues during the first quarter of 2018 fiscal year.\nDuring the 2017 period, the Company had one customer from whom it generated sales greater than 10% of net revenues. Revenue from this customer was $4,036,591, or 22% of net revenues during the period. Total accounts receivable from this customer at October 31, 2017 was $289,571 or 21% of accounts receivable.\nGross Margin: Margins were 66.4% in the 2017 period (gross profit of $11,967,725) compared to 59.9% (gross profit of $12,652,997) in the 2016 period representing an increase of 6.6 percentage points. The increase in gross margin reflects the different mix of sales in the 2017 period, in particular, the Products Segment generated more revenues than the Services Segment and the Products Segment in general yields a greater gross margin on the sale or rental of its products.\nResearch and Development (R&D): R&D expenditures increased by 36.2% from $1,013,125 in the 2016 period to $1,380,381 in the 2017 period and was in line with our budgetary plans for the 2017 period.\nThe increase in our R&D expenditure in the 2017 period reflects an increase in our R&D expenditure in the Services Segment.\nR&D expenditures in the Products Segment decreased by 9.2% from $1,013,125 in the 2016 period as compared to $919,863 in the 2017 period. In the 2018 fiscal year however, we would anticipate this category of expenditures to increase substantially in the Products Segment as we are investing in the advancement of our fourth generation of products ( 4G\u201d) and to this end, we plan to recruit up to 14 new members of staff in this segment as part of our efforts to advance our product development program. Our goal will be to bring more competitively priced and technologically advanced products in this range to the market under a 12-18 months product roll out plan. The first of our series of products in our 4G of products was launched on January 16, 2018. Nevertheless, it should be noted that we may incur significant research expenditures without realizing viable products or we may not be successful in the launch of new products.\nR&D expenditures in the Services Segment were $460,518 in the 2017 period compared to nil in the 2016 period. These expenditures were in line with our budgetary plans as we are investing significantly in the refreshing the Thermite\u00ae range of products which is a significant part of our growth strategy (Services Segment). The Thermite\u00ae is a product which we acquired from Quantum 3D in 2014 and it has a prestigious customer base. We believe that the technically refreshed Thermite presents a substantial opportunity to grow this part of our business.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG&A): SG&A expenditures for the 2017 period increased to $6,769,327 from $6,101,227 for the 2016 period, an increase of 11.0%. The increase in our SG&A expenditures in the 2017 period is broadly attributed to the increased costs associated with becoming a SEC reporting company and listing on the NASDAQ exchange. Approximately $100,000 of the increased amount in our SG&A expenditures constitutes non-recurring costs associated with these activities.\nKey Areas of SG&A Expenditure across the Group for the year ended October 31, 2017 compared to the year ended October 31, 2016\nTable 52: <table> <tr> <td>Expenditure </td> <td> </td> <td>October 31, 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>October 31, 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage Change </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Wages and Salaries </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,010,778 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,161,838 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Decrease of 3.6% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Legal and Professional Fees (including accounting, audit and investment banking services) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>934,937 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>757,405 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase of 23.4% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Rent for our various locations </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>101,728 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>251,957 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Decrease of 59.6% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Marketing </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>222,589 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>149,790 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase of 48.6% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAlthough there is a modest decrease in Wages and Salaries we would expect in the 2018 fiscal year this category to increase to reflect the investments we are making in bringing in more staff to expedite the advancement of our 4G products which we are developing.\nThe increase in our Legal and Professional Fees in the 2017 period is attributed to the increased costs associated with becoming a SEC reporting company and our listing on the NASDAQ.\nUpon surrender of our leased properties in Edinburgh, we would anticipate that the category of expenditures constituting Rent\u201d will decrease significantly.\nWe also expect that the category Marketing expenditures in the fiscal year 2018 will increase to reflect increased marketing efforts on our new generation of products both in the Products and Services Segment. Furthermore, the Products Segment will be demonstrating our products at the biggest Industry event in 2018 ( Oceanology 2018) and there are significant costs associated with these activities.\nTable 53: <table><tr><td>27 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Income: Operating Income for the 2017 period declined by 31.1% and was $3,818,017 as compared to $5,538,645 in the 2016 period.\nThe decrease in Operating Income in the 2017 period compared to the 2016 period is attributed to the decline in our revenues by 14.6% for the reasons discussed earlier, in conjunction with material increases in both our SG&A expenditures and our R&D expenditures by 11.8% and 36.2% respectively, in the 2017 period.\nInterest Expense: Interest expense during the 2017 period was $597,011 compared to $856,432 during the 2016 period, representing an overall 30.3% decrease.\nThis category of expenditure is related to interest payable under (i) Senior Secured Convertible Debentures (SSCD) which was entered into on or around February 21, 2007, where we paid six months of interest payments in the 2017 period. The amounts outstanding under the SSCD were repaid in full on or around April 28, 2017; and (ii) newly entered into Senior Secured Debentures with HSBC NA on or around April 28, 2017 and where we have paid six months interest in the 2017 period and (iii) interest payable on loan by the CEO to one of our subsidiaries, Coda Octopus Colmek. The reduction is due to the cancellation of the previous SSCD which attracted 8.5% interest per annum and the introduction of a more favorable interest rates of 4.56% now in place under the HSBC Senior Secured Debentures. Going forward on an annualized basis we would anticipate annual interest expenditures on the HSBC NA Debentures to fall and will be approximately $285,000 (in 2018) and $182,000 (2019), as under the repayment terms we are also repaying principal amounts. The amortization schedule for this loan is set out in Note 8 of the audited Consolidated Financial Statement of October 31, 2017 and 2016.\nOther Income: This category was $121,278 in the 2017 period as compared to $172,090 in the 2016 period representing a decrease of 29.5%. The make-up of this category is UK Value Added Tax rebates from purchases made outside of the European Union by our UK operations and is subject to fluctuations as it usually reflects Value Added Tax rebates (equivalent of the US Sales Tax) from purchases made outside of the European Union by our UK operations and changes according to the level of purchases we make outside of the European Union in the period.\nNet Income for the year ended October 31, 2017 compared to the year ended October 31, 2016\nNet Income for the 2017 period was $3,339,663 compared to $4,930,548 for the 2016 period, representing a decrease of 32.3%. Net Income fell due to the significant decline in our revenues in the 2017 period in conjunction with material increases in both our SG&A and R&D expenditures for the 2017 period. See earlier discussions in MD&A Section for the reasons revenues declined in the 2017 period and SG&A & R&D expenditures increased. The decline in revenues also resulted in the Services Segment breaking even in the 2017 period (See Segment Analysis section of this report) combined with material increases in both our SG&A and R&D expenditures in the 2017 period. See earlier discussions in the R&D and SG&A section of this MD&A report.\nComprehensive Income for the year ended October 31, 2017 compared to the year ended October 31, 2016\nTable 54: <table> <tr> <td>Year Ended October 31, 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended October 31, 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage Change </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>$ </td> <td>3,638,669 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,219,595 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase of 63.9% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the 2016 period we suffered a significant loss of $2,710,953 in foreign currency translation adjustments of the values of our UK assets included in our financial statements due to the depreciation of the value of the British pound, a part of the so-called Brexit effect. For the 2017 period we recorded a gain of $299,006 on foreign currency translation adjustments due to the British pound strengthening against the US dollar over the 2017 period.\nSince the UK decided to leave the European Union the British pound has been falling significantly against the US dollar (see Note 2 paragraph n of Notes to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements for October 31, 2017 and 2016 for fuller information regarding our Foreign Currency Translation policy).\nSegment Analysis\nWe are operating in two reportable segments, which are managed separately based upon fundamental differences in their operations. Segment operating income is total segment revenue reduced by operating expenses identifiable with the business segment. Overhead includes general corporate administrative costs.\nTable 55: <table><tr><td>28 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company evaluates performance and allocates resources based upon operating income.

</tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt October 31, 2017, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $36,982,937, working capital surplus of $11,140,403 and stockholders' equity of $13,827,420. For the period then ended, the Company generated cash flow from operations of $4,840,392.\nWe believe that our current level of cash and cash generation will be sufficient to meet our future short- and medium-term liquidity needs. At October 31, 2017, we had cash on hand of approximately $6.9 million and both billed and unbilled receivables of approximately $4.1 million. Our current cash balance represents approximately one-year of Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. The Company continues to critically evaluate the level of expenses that we incur and reduce those expenses as appropriate. See also Note 15 - Subsequent Events in our audited Consolidated Financial Statements - covering the recent private placement transaction completed on January 29, 2018. The proceeds will increase our liquidity and working capital resources.\nOur main liquidity issues are funding of our research and development program ( R&D\u201d) which requires significant expenditures in bringing on new skills and resources and incurring non-recoverable and non-recurring engineering costs for researching, developing and prototyping products; and managing our currency exposure because of our operations in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia and servicing our senior security debentures.\nOur Colmek subsidiary received a $1 million loan from the CEO of Coda to fund the purchase of long lead-time inventory (which are typically on between 12- 32 weeks lead time cycle) in order to be able to comply with delivery dates for contracts when they are secured. The repayment date of this loan has been extended to November 30, 2018.\nSubstantially all our properties are owned by the Company and there are no mortgage obligations on those properties.\nWe have a significant concern about adverse currency fluctuations and the effect that those currency fluctuations have on our operations and profitability. As mentioned previously, the United Kingdom's potential exit from the European Union ( Brexit\u201d) has had a significant negative effect on the value of the British pound versus the U. S. dollar. A significant portion of our business is in the United Kingdom and the substantial decrease in the value of the British pound is reflected in lower revenues for our product sales. In addition, all our loans are denominated in U. S. dollars, which means that the dollar value of those loans has effectively gone up since these are partially serviced with British Pounds. While we have chosen not to hedge any of our currency exposure, we continue to evaluate the need to do so and will consider a hedging strategy when, and if, appropriate.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash generated from operating activities for the year ended October 31, 2017 was $4,840,392. We recorded net income for the period of $3,339,663. Other items in uses and sources of funds from operations included non-cash charges related to depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation, which collectively totaled $1,057,684. Changes in operating assets increased net cash from operating activities by $1,224,062 and changes in current liabilities decreased net cash from operating activities by $701,784.\nTable 61: <table><tr><td>31 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used by investing activities for the year ended October 31, 2017 was $2,043,055 due to the sale and purchase of fixed assets.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended October 31, 2017 was $1,846,571 as a result of paying down the debt of the Company and redeeming the Series C preferred stock.\nSecured Promissory Note\nOn April 28, 2017, Coda Octopus Group, Inc. (the Company\u201d) together with its wholly owned US subsidiaries, Coda Octopus Products, Inc. and Coda Octopus Colmek, Inc. (together, the Subsidiaries\u201d), entered into a loan agreement with HSBC Bank NA (the Lender\u201d) for a loan in the principal amount of $8,000,000 (the Loan\u201d). The annual interest rate is fixed at 4.56%. Commencing on May 28, 2017 and continuing on the 28th day of each month thereafter, the Company is required to make monthly principal and interest payments of $149,350 until April 28, 2022 (making our annual payments under this Note $1,792,200). In addition, within 30 days after the delivery to the Lender of the Company's annual audited consolidated financial statements, the Company is required to make an annual principal payment of $700,000 during the term of the Loan. Such annual payments will reduce the balance of the principal outstanding. As a result, it is expected that the Loan will be repaid within a period of approximately 45 months. The Loan may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time subject to a break funding charge as detailed in the promissory note evidencing the Loan.\nThe obligations in connection with the repayment of the Loan are secured by all assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries. In addition, the repayment of the Loan is guaranteed by three of the Company's overseas subsidiaries.\nThe proceeds from the Loan were used to repay in its entirety the outstanding principal balance of $8,000,000 under secured debentures (the Debentures\u201d) that were issued by the Company in February 2007 and that were most recently held by CCM Holdings, LLC. ( CCM\u201d). In addition, accrued and unpaid interest under the said Debentures of approximately $1,133,261 was satisfied through the issuance to CCM of 1,000 shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001, with a stated value of $1,000 each (the Preferred Stock\u201d). The Company paid the balance in cash.\nAs of October 31, 2017, the Company is indebted to the lender in the amount of $7,279,353. See Note 8 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPrivate Placement\nOn January 29, 2018, the Company consummated the sale and issuance of 1,125,950 shares of its common stock in a private placement of shares of common stock at $4.40 per share (the Offering\u201d). Total gross proceeds from the Offering were $4,954,180. The purchase price per share was based on a 10% discount of the volume weighted average price (VWAP) of the common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market for the 30-consecutive trading-day period ending on January 22, 2018.\nUnder the terms of the Offering, the Company is required to file a re-sale registration statement prior to May 30, 2018 with respect to the shares issued in the Offering. For a period of 36 months, the investors also have the right to purchase, based on their pro-rata ownership of common stock, shares (or securities convertible into shares) offered in subsequent offerings, subject to certain limited exceptions.\nForeign Currency\nThe Company maintains its books in local currency: US Dollars for its US operations, Pounds Sterling for its United Kingdom operations, Norwegian and Danish Kroner for its Norwegian and Danish operations respectively and Australian Dollars for its Australian operations.\nFor the fiscal year ended 2017, 42% of the Company's operations were conducted inside the United States and 58% outside the United States through its wholly owned subsidiaries. As a result, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may significantly affect the Company's sales, profitability and financial position when the foreign currencies of its international operations are translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting. In addition, we are also subject to currency fluctuation risk with respect to certain foreign currency denominated receivables and payables. Although the Company cannot predict the extent to which currency fluctuations may affect the Company's business and financial position, there is a risk that such fluctuations will have an adverse impact on the Company's sales, profits and financial position. Because differing portions of our revenues and costs are denominated in foreign currency, movements could impact our margins by, for example, decreasing our foreign revenues when the dollar strengthens and not correspondingly decreasing our expenses. The Company does not currently hedge its currency exposure. In the future, we may engage in hedging transactions to mitigate foreign exchange risk.\nTable 62: <table><tr><td>32 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe translation of the Company's UK operations' British Pound denominated balance sheets and results of operations into US dollars was affected by changes in the average value of the US dollar against the British Pound. The average exchange rate during the 2017 period was $1.2829 USD to the GBP against $1.3860 during the 2016 period - a depreciation of the value of the GBP against the USD of 7.4%.\nThe translation of the Company's Australian operations' Australian Dollar denominated balance sheets and results of operations into US dollars was affected by changes in the average value of the US dollar against the Australian Dollar. The average exchange rate during the 2017 period was $0.7626 USD to the AUD against $0.7429 during the 2016 period - an appreciation of the value of the AUD against the USD of 2.6%.\nThe translation of the Company's Norwegian operation's Norwegian Kroner (NOK) denominated balance sheets and results of operations into US dollars has been affected by the currency fluctuations of the US dollar against the NOK from an average rate of $0.1189 during the 2016 period, to $0.1206 during the 2017 period - an appreciation of the value of the NOK against the USD of 1.4%.

All of these amounts are material to our overall financial results.\nAs a result of the decision by British voters to leave the European Union, we expect economic uncertainty to increase until the negotiations for the British exit have been completed and the relationship between the UK and the EU has been solidified. This uncertainty will most likely continue to have a profound effect on the value of the British Pound. Since approximately 50% of our revenues are transacted and generated in that British Pound, we expect our revenues to continue to be impacted by the adverse movement of the British Pound against the US Dollar. We also expect our direct costs of sales for components sourced outside of the UK for our UK operations to increase. Furthermore, our balance sheet will be affected since a significant part of our assets (fixed and current) are held in British Pounds by our UK subsidiaries.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off balance sheet arrangements.\nInflation\nThe effect of inflation on the Company's operating results was not significant during the 2017 period.\nTable 64: <table><tr><td>33 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSeasonality\nResults of operations for our products segment are impacted by the offshore drilling season.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OPERATIONS\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe information herein contains forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical fact made herein are forward looking. In particular, the statements herein regarding industry prospects and future results of operations or financial position are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as believes,\u201d estimates,\u201d could,\u201d possibly,\u201d probably,\u201d anticipates,\u201d projects,\u201d expects,\u201d may,\u201d will,\u201d or should\u201d or other variations or similar words. No assurances can be given that the future results anticipated by the forward-looking statements will be achieved. Forward-looking statements reflect management's current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Our actual results may differ significantly from management's expectations.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, included herewith. This discussion should not be construed to imply that the results discussed herein will necessarily continue into the future, or that any conclusion reached herein will necessarily be indicative of actual operating results in the future. Such discussion represents only the best present assessment of our management.\nGeneral Overview\nWe operate two distinct business segments. Our Products Segment designs and manufactures patented real time 3D sonar solutions and other leading products for subsea applications ( Products Segment\u201d). Our Services Segment supplies engineering services to prime defense contractors ( Services Segment\u201d).\nOur products are used primarily in the underwater construction market, offshore oil and gas, offshore wind energy industry, and in the complex dredging, port security, mining and marine sciences sectors. Our customers include service providers to major oil and gas companies, law enforcement agencies, ports, mining companies, defense bodies, research institutes and universities.\nOur Services segment supplies engineering services mainly to prime defense contractors such as Raytheon and Northrop Grumman. We have long-standing relationships with prime defense contractors. We support some significant defense programs by supplying and maintaining proprietary parts through obsolescence management programs. These services provide recurring stream of revenues for our Services segment.\nHistorically, the Products Segment generated approximately 70% of our revenues. However, during the last three fiscal years prior to the 2017 period, the Products Segment has generated around 50% of our overall revenues, with the Services Segment growing at a faster pace. However, during the 2017 period, due to the new US administration's failure to approve the defense budget, many projected sales did not materialize. As a result, the Services Segment revenues fell from 50% of our overall revenues to 39% in the 2017 with the Products Segment generating 61% of revenues in the 2017 period as compared to 50% in the 2016 period. Although the Products Segment generated 61% of the overall revenues in the 2017 period, it is still adversely affected by the contraction in the oil and gas (O&G) industry. Furthermore, due to the effort by O&G companies to restructure their operations, the climate in which we sell is fiercely competitive thus impacting on revenues and gross margins.\nNevertheless, we believe that our unique and patented real time 3D solutions are a significant advancement on the current technology available in the subsea sonar imaging market due to its real time capability providing real time volumetric data of underwater targets in low or zero visibility conditions and its capability to image moving objects in the subsea environment. Furthermore, because the technology provides real time imaging of the underwater environment, it enhances safety significantly and delivers substantial productivity gains to our customers, thus reducing their costs. In addition, our real time 3D solution is emerging as the preferred solutions for subsea asset placements because of the technology's unique ability to image moving targets (such as Accropodes\u2122, X-Blocs, Antifers block placements, mattress placements, landing of installations on the seabed and the like). Due to the decline in the price of oil, many O&G companies are seeking cost effective solutions for their operations. We believe that our real time 3D solution has the potential to revolutionize the technology used in underwater operations particularly where real time visualization is required or zero or low visibility conditions prevail. We also believe that with the proliferation of underwater drones our technology has significant application for the imaging sonar defense market (which is worth billions of dollars annually) as it is the only available off the shelf technology that can image moving targets (such as underwater vehicles) in the water.\n 22 \nSince introducing this product, we have made progress in getting our core real time 3D technology, the Echoscope\u00ae, adopted by a significant number of ports in the USA (the CodaOctopus\u00ae Underwater Inspection System (which integrates our Echoscope, motion sensing product and hydrographic pole) where it is used for port and harbor security. In 2015 we secured the first sale of our Underwater Inspection System to a foreign government body in East Asia and in 2016 we sold two additional full system to this body. We hope to sell additional systems into this government body as part of their technology upgrade program for the next three years.\nWe have also made progress in expanding the markets (and applications) for our real time 3D sonars. Recently, we have sold a number of systems to mining companies. Increasingly, our customers involved in offshore wind energy and renewables are adopting the technology as the primary tool for scour management, subsea cable installation and associated cable protection tasks.\nIn addition, in recent years we have started to rent our real time 3D solutions with engineering services. Given the contraction in capital expenditures budget in the O&G market, rentals are increasingly becoming an important part of the composition of the Company's revenues and these O&G operators are more prepared to utilize operational budgets. Furthermore, our rental offering generally yields a higher gross margin for the Company.\nOur business is affected by a number of factors including those set out below:\n A. The Company's operations are split between the United States, United Kingdom, Australia and Norway. A large proportion of our revenues (approximately 58%) and costs are incurred outside of the USA with a significant part (50% of our total revenues) of that in the United Kingdom ( UK\u201d). In addition, a significant part of our assets (both current and fixed) are held in British Pounds by our foreign subsidiaries. B. On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom voted to exit the European Union. This resulted in significant currency exchange rate fluctuations and volatility in global stock markets including a sharp fall of the British Pound against the US Dollar. The British government has commenced negotiations to determine the terms of the exit from the European Union (so-called Brexit\u201d). The United Kingdom's separation could, among other things, disrupt trade and the free movement of goods, services and people between the United Kingdom and the European Union or other countries as well as create legal and global economic uncertainty. Currencies could remain volatile for the foreseeable future. C. Since the Brexit vote, we have suffered adverse currency movements affecting our UK Businesses. In summary, since our reporting currency is the US Dollar, the fall in the British Pound impacts on our revenues, costs and balance sheet valuation. D. Given the lack of comparable precedent, the implications of Brexit or how such implications might affect the Company in the medium to long term are unclear. \nFurther areas of impact include:\n i. the price of commodities, in particular O&G. The decline in O&G prices since 2014 with a partial recovery since 2016 has resulted in large scale reductions in capital and operational expenditures, which directly impact on the sales of our products into these and related markets and also our gross margins; ii. the allocation of funds to defense procurement by governments in the United States and the United Kingdom; iii. volatility of the markets including the currency market; iv. approximately 50% of the Company revenues are transacted and generated in British Pounds by the Company's subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and therefore we have a currency exposure.. The depreciation of the British Pound against major currencies adversely impacts our revenues as a whole which are reported in U.S. Dollars. Furthermore, a large part of our assets is held in British Pounds while the majority of our liabilities (which comprise our senior secured debentures - see Note 8 of the audited Consolidated Financial Statements) are maintained in U.S. Dollars. In the 2017 period as compared to the same 2016 period, we realized a balance sheet gain on our assets due to a slight gain in the British Pound against the US Dollar prevailing at the balance sheet date of October 31, 2017. In fiscal year 2017 compared to the 2016 period, we incurred a loss from the exchange rate translations in respect of our profit and loss account. See Note 2, paragraph n, of the audited Consolidated Financial Statements October 31, 2017 and 2016 regarding our Foreign Currency Translation policy. v. global-political uncertainties affecting the markets into which we sell our goods and services; vi. global trends which make certain geographical regions more competitive in providing engineering solutions because of lower labor costs (e.g. India and China) are likely to affect our Engineering Businesses in the Group; vii. being a small technology company, we are unable to compete for certain specialized electronic engineering skills as our remuneration package is not as competitive as those offered by bigger companies; viii. the Company has issued and outstanding a promissory note (See Note 8 of the audited Consolidated Financial Statements October 31, 2017 and 2016). This note is secured by all of the Company's assets in the USA and is also guaranteed by its overseas subsidiaries; \n 23 \n ix. we lack the financial resources to advance our flagship technology at the commercially appropriate pace required to capture new markets and increase our sales which could facilitate new entrants to the market. For example, Teledyne Technologies Incorporated, a multi-billion company, has recently acquired a number of subsea companies that may speed up their entry into our market; x a significant part of our growth strategy is predicated on our patented real time 3D sonar technology. The technology space is inherently uncertain due to the fast pace of innovations and therefore we can give no assurance that we can maintain our leading position in the real time 3D imaging sonar market or that innovations in other areas may not surpass our unique capability that we currently supply to subsea market; and xi. the Company has limited external sources of capital available, and as such is reliant upon its ability to sell its products and services to provide sufficient working capital for its operations and obligations. \nCritical Accounting Policies\nThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported values of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported levels of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.\nBelow is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results and that may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain. A discussion of our significant accounting policies, including further discussion of the accounting policies described below, can be found in Note 2, Summary of Accounting Policies\u201d of our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue is derived from sales of underwater technologies and equipment for imaging, mapping, defense and survey applications and from the engineering services which we provide. Revenue is recognized when evidence of a contractual arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the contract price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. No right of return privileges are granted to customers after delivery.\nFor arrangements with multiple deliverables, we recognize product revenue by allocating the revenue to each deliverable based on the relative fair value of each deliverable, and recognize revenue when equipment is delivered, and for installation and other services as they are performed.\n 24 \nOur contracts sometimes require customer payments in advance of revenue recognition. These amounts are reflected as liabilities and recognized as revenue when the Company has fulfilled its obligations under the respective contracts.\nFor software license sales for which any services rendered are not considered essential to the functionality of the software, we recognize revenue upon delivery of the software, provided (1) there is evidence of a contractual arrangement for this, (2) collection of our fee is considered probable and (3) the fee is fixed and determinable.\nFor arrangements that are generated from time and material contracts where there is a signed agreement and approved purchase order in place that specifies the fixed hourly rate and other reimbursable costs to be billed based on material and direct labor hours incurred, revenue is recognized on these contracts based on material and direct labor hours incurred. Revenues from fixed-price contracts are recognized on the percentage-of-completion method, measured by the percentage of costs incurred (materials and direct labor hours) to date to estimated total services (materials and direct labor hours) for each contract. This method is used as expenditures for direct materials and labor hours are considered to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts. Losses on fixed-price contracts are recognized during the period in which the loss first becomes apparent based upon costs incurred to date and the estimated costs to complete as determined by experience from similar contracts. Variations from estimated contract performance could result in adjustments to operating results.\nRental Revenue is recognized monthly over the term of the rental period.\nRecoverability of Deferred Costs\nWe defer costs on projects for service revenue. Deferred costs consist primarily of direct and incremental costs to customize and install systems, as defined in individual customer contracts, including costs to acquire hardware and software from third parties and payroll costs for our employees and other third parties.\nWe recognize such costs in accordance with our revenue recognition policy by contract. For revenue recognized under the completed contract method, costs are deferred until the products are delivered, or upon completion of services or, where applicable, customer acceptance. For revenue recognized under the percentage of completion method, costs are recognized as products are delivered or services are provided in accordance with the percentage of completion calculation. For revenue recognized ratably over the term of the contract, costs are recognized ratably over the term of the contract, commencing on the date of revenue recognition. At each balance sheet date, we review deferred costs, to ensure they are ultimately recoverable. Any anticipated losses on uncompleted contracts are recognized when evidence indicates the estimated total cost of a contract exceeds its estimated total revenue.\nStock Based Compensation\nWe recognize the expense related to the fair value of stock based compensation awards within the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. We use the fair value method for equity instruments granted to non-employees and use the Black-Scholes model for measuring the fair value. The stock based fair value compensation is determined as of the date of the grant or the date at which the performance of the services is completed (measurement date) and is recognized over the periods in which the related services are rendered.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740). Under ASC 740, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the income tax effects of differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their bases for income tax reporting. The Company's differences arise principally from the use of various accelerated and modified accelerated cost recovery system for income tax purposes versus straight line depreciation used for book purposes and from the utilization of net operating loss carry-forwards.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are the amounts by which the Company's future income taxes are expected to be impacted by these differences as they reverse. Deferred tax assets are based on differences that are expected to decrease future income taxes as they reverse. Correspondingly, deferred tax liabilities are based on differences that are expected to increase future income taxes as they reverse. Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements discusses the amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and also presents the impact of significant differences between financial reporting income and taxable income.\n 25 \nFor income tax purposes, the Company uses the percentage of completion method of recognizing revenues on long-term contracts which is consistent with the Company's financial reporting under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets consist principally of the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired (or goodwill), customer relationships, non-compete agreements and licenses. Goodwill was allocated to our reporting units based on the original purchase price allocation. Goodwill is not amortized and is evaluated for impairment annually or more often if circumstances indicate impairment may exist. Customer relationships, non-compete agreements, patents and licenses are being amortized on a straight-line basis over periods of 2 to 10 years. The Company amortizes its limited lived intangible assets using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit. We periodically evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets and take into account events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate that impairment exists.\nThe first step of the goodwill impairment test, used to identify potential impairment, compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value, which is based on future cash flows, exceeds the carrying amount, goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, the second step must be performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. The second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. At the end of each year, we evaluate goodwill on a separate reporting unit basis to assess recoverability, and impairments, if any, are recognized in earnings. An impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nWe operate two distinct business segments. Our Marine Technology Business designs and manufactures patented real time 3D sonar solutions and other leading products for subsea applications ( Products Segment\u201d). Our Marine Engineering Business supplies engineering services to prime defense contractors ( Services Segment\u201d).\nOur Products Segment sells its products and associated services to the offshore wind energy, dredging and marine construction, marine and port security, mining including deep sea mining, marine sciences sector and oil and gas sector. This segment generated approximately 61% and 50% of our total revenues for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nOur Services Segment largely sells its services into prime and sub-prime defense contractors. This segment generated approximately 39% and 50% of our total revenues for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This segment continues to be an important part of the Group's revenues plan and, in particular, our subsidiary Coda Octopus Colmek.\nComparison of fiscal year ended October 31, 2017 ( 2017 period\u201d) to fiscal year ended October 31, 2016 ( 2016 period\u201d)\nThroughout this discussion, the 2017 period\u201d means the fiscal year ended October 31, 2017. Similarly, the 2016 period\u201d means the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016.\nSee Segment information below for a full breakout of the financial performance of each Segment for the 2017 and 2016 periods, respectively.\nThe information provided below pertains to the consolidated analysis of both segments (Products and Services) operating in our Group.\n 26 \nRevenue: Total revenues in the 2017 and 2016 periods were $18,025,173 and $21,118,319, respectively, representing a 14.6% decrease in the 2017 period.\nThe reason for the decline in our revenues during the 2017 period is the delay by the new US administration in approving defense spending (and budget). This has resulted in prime defense contractors not finalizing contracts with Coda Octopus Colmek (a part of our Services Segment) that were anticipated in our Business Plan for the 2017 period. Accordingly, during the 2017 period, revenues generated by our Services segment were $7,038,905 as compared to $10,534,178 during the 2016 period (a decline of 33.2% (See break out in Segment Analysis on page of this report)). Although these opportunities which were projected in the 2017 period have not gone away, this segment continues to be impacted by the uncertainty around the timescales for the approval of the defense budget by the new administration.\nOur outlook for this segment in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 is that its results will be significantly impacted by this ongoing delay, thus resulting in an overall decline in the Group's revenues during the first quarter of 2018 fiscal year.\nDuring the 2017 period, the Company had one customer from whom it generated sales greater than 10% of net revenues. Revenue from this customer was $4,036,591, or 22% of net revenues during the period. Total accounts receivable from this customer at October 31, 2017 was $289,571 or 21% of accounts receivable.\nGross Margin: Margins were 66.4% in the 2017 period (gross profit of $11,967,725) compared to 59.9% (gross profit of $12,652,997) in the 2016 period representing an increase of 6.6 percentage points. The increase in gross margin reflects the different mix of sales in the 2017 period, in particular, the Products Segment generated more revenues than the Services Segment and the Products Segment in general yields a greater gross margin on the sale or rental of its products.\nResearch and Development (R&D): R&D expenditures increased by 36.2% from $1,013,125 in the 2016 period to $1,380,381 in the 2017 period and was in line with our budgetary plans for the 2017 period.\nThe increase in our R&D expenditure in the 2017 period reflects an increase in our R&D expenditure in the Services Segment.\nR&D expenditures in the Products Segment decreased by 9.2% from $1,013,125 in the 2016 period as compared to $919,863 in the 2017 period. In the 2018 fiscal year however, we would anticipate this category of expenditures to increase substantially in the Products Segment as we are investing in the advancement of our fourth generation of products ( 4G\u201d) and to this end, we plan to recruit up to 14 new members of staff in this segment as part of our efforts to advance our product development program. Our goal will be to bring more competitively priced and technologically advanced products in this range to the market under a 12-18 months product roll out plan. The first of our series of products in our 4G of products was launched on January 16, 2018. Nevertheless, it should be noted that we may incur significant research expenditures without realizing viable products or we may not be successful in the launch of new products.\nR&D expenditures in the Services Segment were $460,518 in the 2017 period compared to nil in the 2016 period. These expenditures were in line with our budgetary plans as we are investing significantly in the refreshing the Thermite\u00ae range of products which is a significant part of our growth strategy (Services Segment). The Thermite\u00ae is a product which we acquired from Quantum 3D in 2014 and it has a prestigious customer base. We believe that the technically refreshed Thermite presents a substantial opportunity to grow this part of our business.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG&A): SG&A expenditures for the 2017 period increased to $6,769,327 from $6,101,227 for the 2016 period, an increase of 11.0%. The increase in our SG&A expenditures in the 2017 period is broadly attributed to the increased costs associated with becoming a SEC reporting company and listing on the NASDAQ exchange. Approximately $100,000 of the increased amount in our SG&A expenditures constitutes non-recurring costs associated with these activities.\nKey Areas of SG&A Expenditure across the Group for the year ended October 31, 2017 compared to the year ended October 31, 2016\nTable 52: <table> <tr> <td>Expenditure </td> <td> </td> <td>October 31, 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>October 31, 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage Change </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Wages and Salaries </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,010,778 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,161,838 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Decrease of 3.6% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Legal and Professional Fees (including accounting, audit and investment banking services) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>934,937 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>757,405 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase of 23.4% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Rent for our various locations </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>101,728 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>251,957 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Decrease of 59.6% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Marketing </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>222,589 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>149,790 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase of 48.6% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAlthough there is a modest decrease in Wages and Salaries we would expect in the 2018 fiscal year this category to increase to reflect the investments we are making in bringing in more staff to expedite the advancement of our 4G products which we are developing.\nThe increase in our Legal and Professional Fees in the 2017 period is attributed to the increased costs associated with becoming a SEC reporting company and our listing on the NASDAQ.\nUpon surrender of our leased properties in Edinburgh, we would anticipate that the category of expenditures constituting Rent\u201d will decrease significantly.\nWe also expect that the category Marketing expenditures in the fiscal year 2018 will increase to reflect increased marketing efforts on our new generation of products both in the Products and Services Segment. Furthermore, the Products Segment will be demonstrating our products at the biggest Industry event in 2018 ( Oceanology 2018) and there are significant costs associated with these activities.\n 27 \nOperating Income: Operating Income for the 2017 period declined by 31.1% and was $3,818,017 as compared to $5,538,645 in the 2016 period.\nThe decrease in Operating Income in the 2017 period compared to the 2016 period is attributed to the decline in our revenues by 14.6% for the reasons discussed earlier, in conjunction with material increases in both our SG&A expenditures and our R&D expenditures by 11.8% and 36.2% respectively, in the 2017 period.\nInterest Expense: Interest expense during the 2017 period was $597,011 compared to $856,432 during the 2016 period, representing an overall 30.3% decrease.\nThis category of expenditure is related to interest payable under (i) Senior Secured Convertible Debentures (SSCD) which was entered into on or around February 21, 2007, where we paid six months of interest payments in the 2017 period. The amounts outstanding under the SSCD were repaid in full on or around April 28, 2017; and (ii) newly entered into Senior Secured Debentures with HSBC NA on or around April 28, 2017 and where we have paid six months interest in the 2017 period and (iii) interest payable on loan by the CEO to one of our subsidiaries, Coda Octopus Colmek. The reduction is due to the cancellation of the previous SSCD which attracted 8.5% interest per annum and the introduction of a more favorable interest rates of 4.56% now in place under the HSBC Senior Secured Debentures. Going forward on an annualized basis we would anticipate annual interest expenditures on the HSBC NA Debentures to fall and will be approximately $285,000 (in 2018) and $182,000 (2019), as under the repayment terms we are also repaying principal amounts. The amortization schedule for this loan is set out in Note 8 of the audited Consolidated Financial Statement of October 31, 2017 and 2016.\nOther Income: This category was $121,278 in the 2017 period as compared to $172,090 in the 2016 period representing a decrease of 29.5%. The make-up of this category is UK Value Added Tax rebates from purchases made outside of the European Union by our UK operations and is subject to fluctuations as it usually reflects Value Added Tax rebates (equivalent of the US Sales Tax) from purchases made outside of the European Union by our UK operations and changes according to the level of purchases we make outside of the European Union in the period.\nNet Income for the year ended October 31, 2017 compared to the year ended October 31, 2016\nNet Income for the 2017 period was $3,339,663 compared to $4,930,548 for the 2016 period, representing a decrease of 32.3%. Net Income fell due to the significant decline in our revenues in the 2017 period in conjunction with material increases in both our SG&A and R&D expenditures for the 2017 period. See earlier discussions in MD&A Section for the reasons revenues declined in the 2017 period and SG&A & R&D expenditures increased. The decline in revenues also resulted in the Services Segment breaking even in the 2017 period (See Segment Analysis section of this report) combined with material increases in both our SG&A and R&D expenditures in the 2017 period. See earlier discussions in the R&D and SG&A section of this MD&A report.\nComprehensive Income for the year ended October 31, 2017 compared to the year ended October 31, 2016\nTable 54: <table> <tr> <td>Year Ended October 31, 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended October 31, 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage Change </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>$ </td> <td>3,638,669 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,219,595 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase of 63.9% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the 2016 period we suffered a significant loss of $2,710,953 in foreign currency translation adjustments of the values of our UK assets included in our financial statements due to the depreciation of the value of the British pound, a part of the so-called Brexit effect. For the 2017 period we recorded a gain of $299,006 on foreign currency translation adjustments due to the British pound strengthening against the US dollar over the 2017 period.\nSince the UK decided to leave the European Union the British pound has been falling significantly against the US dollar (see Note 2 paragraph n of Notes to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements for October 31, 2017 and 2016 for fuller information regarding our Foreign Currency Translation policy).\nSegment Analysis\nWe are operating in two reportable segments, which are managed separately based upon fundamental differences in their operations. Segment operating income is total segment revenue reduced by operating expenses identifiable with the business segment. Overhead includes general corporate administrative costs.\n 28 \nThe Company evaluates performance and allocates resources based upon operating income. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of accounting policies.\nThere are inter-segment sales in the table below which have been eliminated from our financial statements. However, for the purpose of segment reporting, these are included in the table below only.\nThe following tables summarize certain balance sheet and statement of operations information by reportable segment for the financial years ending October 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nTable 56: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Marine Technology Business (Products) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

had an accumulated deficit of $36,982,937, working capital surplus of $11,140,403 and stockholders' equity of $13,827,420. For the period then ended, the Company generated cash flow from operations of $4,840,392.\nWe believe that our current level of cash and cash generation will be sufficient to meet our future short- and medium-term liquidity needs. At October 31, 2017, we had cash on hand of approximately $6.9 million and both billed and unbilled receivables of approximately $4.1 million. Our current cash balance represents approximately one-year of Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. The Company continues to critically evaluate the level of expenses that we incur and reduce those expenses as appropriate. See also Note 15 - Subsequent Events in our audited Consolidated Financial Statements - covering the recent private placement transaction completed on January 29, 2018. The proceeds will increase our liquidity and working capital resources.\nOur main liquidity issues are funding of our research and development program ( R&D\u201d) which requires significant expenditures in bringing on new skills and resources and incurring non-recoverable and non-recurring engineering costs for researching, developing and prototyping products; and managing our currency exposure because of our operations in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia and servicing our senior security debentures.\nOur Colmek subsidiary received a $1 million loan from the CEO of Coda to fund the purchase of long lead-time inventory (which are typically on between 12- 32 weeks lead time cycle) in order to be able to comply with delivery dates for contracts when they are secured. The repayment date of this loan has been extended to November 30, 2018.\nSubstantially all our properties are owned by the Company and there are no mortgage obligations on those properties.\nWe have a significant concern about adverse currency fluctuations and the effect that those currency fluctuations have on our operations and profitability. As mentioned previously, the United Kingdom's potential exit from the European Union ( Brexit\u201d) has had a significant negative effect on the value of the British pound versus the U. S. dollar. A significant portion of our business is in the United Kingdom and the substantial decrease in the value of the British pound is reflected in lower revenues for our product sales. In addition, all our loans are denominated in U. S. dollars, which means that the dollar value of those loans has effectively gone up since these are partially serviced with British Pounds. While we have chosen not to hedge any of our currency exposure, we continue to evaluate the need to do so and will consider a hedging strategy when, and if, appropriate.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash generated from operating activities for the year ended October 31, 2017 was $4,840,392. We recorded net income for the period of $3,339,663. Other items in uses and sources of funds from operations included non-cash charges related to depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation, which collectively totaled $1,057,684. Changes in operating assets increased net cash from operating activities by $1,224,062 and changes in current liabilities decreased net cash from operating activities by $701,784.\n 31 \nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used by investing activities for the year ended October 31, 2017 was $2,043,055 due to the sale and purchase of fixed assets.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended October 31, 2017 was $1,846,571 as a result of paying down the debt of the Company and redeeming the Series C preferred stock.\nSecured Promissory Note\nOn April 28, 2017, Coda Octopus Group, Inc. (the Company\u201d) together with its wholly owned US subsidiaries, Coda Octopus Products, Inc. and Coda Octopus Colmek, Inc. (together, the Subsidiaries\u201d), entered into a loan agreement with HSBC Bank NA (the Lender\u201d) for a loan in the principal amount of $8,000,000 (the Loan\u201d). The annual interest rate is fixed at 4.56%. Commencing on May 28, 2017 and continuing on the 28th day of each month thereafter, the Company is required to make monthly principal and interest payments of $149,350 until April 28, 2022 (making our annual payments under this Note $1,792,200). In addition, within 30 days after the delivery to the Lender of the Company's annual audited consolidated financial statements, the Company is required to make an annual principal payment of $700,000 during the term of the Loan. Such annual payments will reduce the balance of the principal outstanding. As a result, it is expected that the Loan will be repaid within a period of approximately 45 months. The Loan may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time subject to a break funding charge as detailed in the promissory note evidencing the Loan.\nThe obligations in connection with the repayment of the Loan are secured by all assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries. In addition, the repayment of the Loan is guaranteed by three of the Company's overseas subsidiaries.\nThe proceeds from the Loan were used to repay in its entirety the outstanding principal balance of $8,000,000 under secured debentures (the Debentures\u201d) that were issued by the Company in February 2007 and that were most recently held by CCM Holdings, LLC. ( CCM\u201d). In addition, accrued and unpaid interest under the said Debentures of approximately $1,133,261 was satisfied through the issuance to CCM of 1,000 shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001, with a stated value of $1,000 each (the Preferred Stock\u201d). The Company paid the balance in cash.\nAs of October 31, 2017, the Company is indebted to the lender in the amount of $7,279,353. See Note 8 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPrivate Placement\nOn January 29, 2018, the Company consummated the sale and issuance of 1,125,950 shares of its common stock in a private placement of shares of common stock at $4.40 per share (the Offering\u201d). Total gross proceeds from the Offering were $4,954,180. The purchase price per share was based on a 10% discount of the volume weighted average price (VWAP) of the common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market for the 30-consecutive trading-day period ending on January 22, 2018.\nUnder the terms of the Offering, the Company is required to file a re-sale registration statement prior to May 30, 2018 with respect to the shares issued in the Offering. For a period of 36 months, the investors also have the right to purchase, based on their pro-rata ownership of common stock, shares (or securities convertible into shares) offered in subsequent offerings, subject to certain limited exceptions.\nForeign Currency\nThe Company maintains its books in local currency: US Dollars for its US operations, Pounds Sterling for its United Kingdom operations, Norwegian and Danish Kroner for its Norwegian and Danish operations respectively and Australian Dollars for its Australian operations.\nFor the fiscal year ended 2017, 42% of the Company's operations were conducted inside the United States and 58% outside the United States through its wholly owned subsidiaries. As a result, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may significantly affect the Company's sales, profitability and financial position when the foreign currencies of its international operations are translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting. In addition, we are also subject to currency fluctuation risk with respect to certain foreign currency denominated receivables and payables. Although the Company cannot predict the extent to which currency fluctuations may affect the Company's business and financial position, there is a risk that such fluctuations will have an adverse impact on the Company's sales, profits and financial position. Because differing portions of our revenues and costs are denominated in foreign currency, movements could impact our margins by, for example, decreasing our foreign revenues when the dollar strengthens and not correspondingly decreasing our expenses. The Company does not currently hedge its currency exposure. In the future, we may engage in hedging transactions to mitigate foreign exchange risk.\n 32 \nThe translation of the Company's UK operations' British Pound denominated balance sheets and results of operations into US dollars was affected by changes in the average value of the US dollar against the British Pound. The average exchange rate during the 2017 period was $1.2829 USD to the GBP against $1.3860 during the 2016 period - a depreciation of the value of the GBP against the USD of 7.4%.\nThe translation of the Company's Australian operations' Australian Dollar denominated balance sheets and results of operations into US dollars was affected by changes in the average value of the US dollar against the Australian Dollar. The average exchange rate during the 2017 period was $0.7626 USD to the AUD against $0.7429 during the 2016 period - an appreciation of the value of the AUD against the USD of 2.6%.\nThe translation of the Company's Norwegian operation's Norwegian Kroner (NOK) denominated balance sheets and results of operations into US dollars has been affected by the currency fluctuations of the US dollar against the NOK from an average rate of $0.1189 during the 2016 period, to $0.1206 during the 2017 period - an appreciation of the value of the NOK against the USD of 1.4%. These are the values that have been used in the calculations below.\nWe have not included the Danish kroner in this schedule as there were no operations in the Danish subsidiary during the 2017 period.\nThe impact of these currency fluctuations on the 2017 period is shown below:\nTable 63: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>British Pounds </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Australian Dollar </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Norwegian Kroner </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>US Dollar </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Actual </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Constant </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Actual </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Constant </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Actual </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Constant </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Results </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Rates </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Results </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Rates </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Results </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Rates </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Effect </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revenues </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,176,478 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,913,932 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,466,123 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,428,287 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(699,618 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Costs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,771,990 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,316,211 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(641,425 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(624,872 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(130,524 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(128,638 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>525,783 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net profit (losses) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,404,488 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,597,721 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>824,698 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>803,415 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(130,524 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(128,638 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(173,835 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,143,971 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,157,797 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>483,833 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>480,161 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,070 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,752 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>990,166 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Liabilities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(901,649 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(828,428 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(919 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(912 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,407 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,359 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(73,275 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,242,322 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,329,368 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>482,914 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>479,248 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,663 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,393 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>916,891 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThis table shows that the effect of constant exchange rates, versus the actual exchange rate fluctuations, decreased net income for the year by $173,835 and increased net assets by $916,891. All of these amounts are material to our overall financial results.\nAs a result of the decision by British voters to leave the European Union, we expect economic uncertainty to increase until the negotiations for the British exit have been completed and the relationship between the UK and the EU has been solidified. This uncertainty will most likely continue to have a profound effect on the value of the British Pound. Since approximately 50% of our revenues are transacted and generated in that British Pound, we expect our revenues to continue to be impacted by the adverse movement of the British Pound against the US Dollar. We also expect our direct costs of sales for components sourced outside of the UK for our UK operations to increase. Furthermore, our balance sheet will be affected since a significant part of our assets (fixed and current) are held in British Pounds by our UK subsidiaries.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off balance sheet arrangements.\nInflation\nThe effect of inflation on the Company's operating results was not significant during the 2017 period.\n 33 \nSeasonality\nResults of operations for our products segment are impacted by the offshore drilling season. During the winter months, when less offshore drilling takes place, demand for our oil and gas related technology is typically at its lowest.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OPERATIONS\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe information herein contains forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical fact made herein are forward looking. In particular, the statements herein regarding industry prospects and future results of operations or financial position are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as believes,\u201d estimates,\u201d could,\u201d possibly,\u201d probably,\u201d anticipates,\u201d projects,\u201d expects,\u201d may,\u201d will,\u201d or should\u201d or other variations or similar words. No assurances can be given that the future results anticipated by the forward-looking statements will be achieved. Forward-looking statements reflect management's current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Our actual results may differ significantly from management's expectations.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, included herewith. This discussion should not be construed to imply that the results discussed herein will necessarily continue into the future, or that any conclusion reached herein will necessarily be indicative of actual operating results in the future. Such discussion represents only the best present assessment of our management.\nGeneral Overview\nWe operate two distinct business segments. Our Products Segment designs and manufactures patented real time 3D sonar solutions and other leading products for subsea applications ( Products Segment\u201d). Our Services Segment supplies engineering services to prime defense contractors ( Services Segment\u201d).\nOur products are used primarily in the underwater construction market, offshore oil and gas, offshore wind energy industry, and in the complex dredging, port security, mining and marine sciences sectors. Our customers include service providers to major oil and gas companies, law enforcement agencies, ports, mining companies, defense bodies, research institutes and universities.\nOur Services segment supplies engineering services mainly to prime defense contractors such as Raytheon and Northrop Grumman. We have long-standing relationships with prime defense contractors. We support some significant defense programs by supplying and maintaining proprietary parts through obsolescence management programs. These services provide recurring stream of revenues for our Services segment.\nHistorically, the Products Segment generated approximately 70% of our revenues. However, during the last three fiscal years prior to the 2017 period, the Products Segment has generated around 50% of our overall revenues, with the Services Segment growing at a faster pace. However, during the 2017 period, due to the new US administration's failure to approve the defense budget, many projected sales did not materialize. As a result, the Services Segment revenues fell from 50% of our overall revenues to 39% in the 2017 with the Products Segment generating 61% of revenues in the 2017 period as compared to 50% in the 2016 period. Although the Products Segment generated 61% of the overall revenues in the 2017 period, it is still adversely affected by the contraction in the oil and gas (O&G) industry. Furthermore, due to the effort by O&G companies to restructure their operations, the climate in which we sell is fiercely competitive thus impacting on revenues and gross margins.\nNevertheless, we believe that our unique and patented real time 3D solutions are a significant advancement on the current technology available in the subsea sonar imaging market due to its real time capability providing real time volumetric data of underwater targets in low or zero visibility conditions and its capability to image moving objects in the subsea environment. Furthermore, because the technology provides real time imaging of the underwater environment, it enhances safety significantly and delivers substantial productivity gains to our customers, thus reducing their costs. In addition, our real time 3D solution is emerging as the preferred solutions for subsea asset placements because of the technology's unique ability to image moving targets (such as Accropodes\u2122, X-Blocs, Antifers block placements, mattress placements, landing of installations on the seabed and the like). Due to the decline in the price of oil, many O&G companies are seeking cost effective solutions for their operations. We believe that our real time 3D solution has the potential to revolutionize the technology used in underwater operations particularly where real time visualization is required or zero or low visibility conditions prevail. We also believe that with the proliferation of underwater drones our technology has significant application for the imaging sonar defense market (which is worth billions of dollars annually) as it is the only available off the shelf technology that can image moving targets (such as underwater vehicles) in the water.\n 22 \nSince introducing this product, we have made progress in getting our core real time 3D technology, the Echoscope\u00ae, adopted by a significant number of ports in the USA (the CodaOctopus\u00ae Underwater Inspection System (which integrates our Echoscope, motion sensing product and hydrographic pole) where it is used for port and harbor security. In 2015 we secured the first sale of our Underwater Inspection System to a foreign government body in East Asia and in 2016 we sold two additional full system to this body. We hope to sell additional systems into this government body as part of their technology upgrade program for the next three years.\nWe have also made progress in expanding the markets (and applications) for our real time 3D sonars. Recently, we have sold a number of systems to mining companies. Increasingly, our customers involved in offshore wind energy and renewables are adopting the technology as the primary tool for scour management, subsea cable installation and associated cable protection tasks.\nIn addition, in recent years we have started to rent our real time 3D solutions with engineering services. Given the contraction in capital expenditures budget in the O&G market, rentals are increasingly becoming an important part of the composition of the Company's revenues and these O&G operators are more prepared to utilize operational budgets. Furthermore, our rental offering generally yields a higher gross margin for the Company.\nOur business is affected by a number of factors including those set out below:\n A. The Company's operations are split between the United States, United Kingdom, Australia and Norway. A large proportion of our revenues (approximately 58%) and costs are incurred outside of the USA with a significant part (50% of our total revenues) of that in the United Kingdom ( UK\u201d). In addition, a significant part of our assets (both current and fixed) are held in British Pounds by our foreign subsidiaries. B. On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom voted to exit the European Union. This resulted in significant currency exchange rate fluctuations and volatility in global stock markets including a sharp fall of the British Pound against the US Dollar. The British government has commenced negotiations to determine the terms of the exit from the European Union (so-called Brexit\u201d). The United Kingdom's separation could, among other things, disrupt trade and the free movement of goods, services and people between the United Kingdom and the European Union or other countries as well as create legal and global economic uncertainty. Currencies could remain volatile for the foreseeable future. C. Since the Brexit vote, we have suffered adverse currency movements affecting our UK Businesses. In summary, since our reporting currency is the US Dollar, the fall in the British Pound impacts on our revenues, costs and balance sheet valuation. D. Given the lack of comparable precedent, the implications of Brexit or how such implications might affect the Company in the medium to long term are unclear. \nFurther areas of impact include:\n i. the price of commodities, in particular O&G. The decline in O&G prices since 2014 with a partial recovery since 2016 has resulted in large scale reductions in capital and operational expenditures, which directly impact on the sales of our products into these and related markets and also our gross margins; ii. the allocation of funds to defense procurement by governments in the United States and the United Kingdom; iii. volatility of the markets including the currency market; iv. approximately 50% of the Company revenues are transacted and generated in British Pounds by the Company's subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and therefore we have a currency exposure.. The depreciation of the British Pound against major currencies adversely impacts our revenues as a whole which are reported in U.S. Dollars. Furthermore, a large part of our assets is held in British Pounds while the majority of our liabilities (which comprise our senior secured debentures - see Note 8 of the audited Consolidated Financial Statements) are maintained in U.S. Dollars. In the 2017 period as compared to the same 2016 period, we realized a balance sheet gain on our assets due to a slight gain in the British Pound against the US Dollar prevailing at the balance sheet date of October 31, 2017. In fiscal year 2017 compared to the 2016 period, we incurred a loss from the exchange rate translations in respect of our profit and loss account. See Note 2, paragraph n, of the audited Consolidated Financial Statements October 31, 2017 and 2016 regarding our Foreign Currency Translation policy. v. global-political uncertainties affecting the markets into which we sell our goods and services; vi. global trends which make certain geographical regions more competitive in providing engineering solutions because of lower labor costs (e.g. India and China) are likely to affect our Engineering Businesses in the Group; vii. being a small technology company, we are unable to compete for certain specialized electronic engineering skills as our remuneration package is not as competitive as those offered by bigger companies; viii. the Company has issued and outstanding a promissory note (See Note 8 of the audited Consolidated Financial Statements October 31, 2017 and 2016). This note is secured by all of the Company's assets in the USA and is also guaranteed by its overseas subsidiaries; \n 23 \n ix. we lack the financial resources to advance our flagship technology at the commercially appropriate pace required to capture new markets and increase our sales which could facilitate new entrants to the market. For example, Teledyne Technologies Incorporated, a multi-billion company, has recently acquired a number of subsea companies that may speed up their entry into our market; x a significant part of our growth strategy is predicated on our patented real time 3D sonar technology. The technology space is inherently uncertain due to the fast pace of innovations and therefore we can give no assurance that we can maintain our leading position in the real time 3D imaging sonar market or that innovations in other areas may not surpass our unique capability that we currently supply to subsea market; and xi. the Company has limited external sources of capital available, and as such is reliant upon its ability to sell its products and services to provide sufficient working capital for its operations and obligations. \nCritical Accounting Policies\nThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported values of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported levels of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.\nBelow is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results and that may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain. A discussion of our significant accounting policies, including further discussion of the accounting policies described below, can be found in Note 2, Summary of Accounting Policies\u201d of our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue is derived from sales of underwater technologies and equipment for imaging, mapping, defense and survey applications and from the engineering services which we provide. Revenue is recognized when evidence of a contractual arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the contract price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. No right of return privileges are granted to customers after delivery.\nFor arrangements with multiple deliverables, we recognize product revenue by allocating the revenue to each deliverable based on the relative fair value of each deliverable, and recognize revenue when equipment is delivered, and for installation and other services as they are performed.\n 24 \nOur contracts sometimes require customer payments in advance of revenue recognition. These amounts are reflected as liabilities and recognized as revenue when the Company has fulfilled its obligations under the respective contracts.\nFor software license sales for which any services rendered are not considered essential to the functionality of the software, we recognize revenue upon delivery of the software, provided (1) there is evidence of a contractual arrangement for this, (2) collection of our fee is considered probable and (3) the fee is fixed and determinable.\nFor arrangements that are generated from time and material contracts where there is a signed agreement and approved purchase order in place that specifies the fixed hourly rate and other reimbursable costs to be billed based on material and direct labor hours incurred, revenue is recognized on these contracts based on material and direct labor hours incurred. Revenues from fixed-price contracts are recognized on the percentage-of-completion method, measured by the percentage of costs incurred (materials and direct labor hours) to date to estimated total services (materials and direct labor hours) for each contract. This method is used as expenditures for direct materials and labor hours are considered to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts. Losses on fixed-price contracts are recognized during the period in which the loss first becomes apparent based upon costs incurred to date and the estimated costs to complete as determined by experience from similar contracts. Variations from estimated contract performance could result in adjustments to operating results.\nRental Revenue is recognized monthly over the term of the rental period.\nRecoverability of Deferred Costs\nWe defer costs on projects for service revenue. Deferred costs consist primarily of direct and incremental costs to customize and install systems, as defined in individual customer contracts, including costs to acquire hardware and software from third parties and payroll costs for our employees and other third parties.\nWe recognize such costs in accordance with our revenue recognition policy by contract. For revenue recognized under the completed contract method, costs are deferred until the products are delivered, or upon completion of services or, where applicable, customer acceptance. For revenue recognized under the percentage of completion method, costs are recognized as products are delivered or services are provided in accordance with the percentage of completion calculation. For revenue recognized ratably over the term of the contract, costs are recognized ratably over the term of the contract, commencing on the date of revenue recognition. At each balance sheet date, we review deferred costs, to ensure they are ultimately recoverable. Any anticipated losses on uncompleted contracts are recognized when evidence indicates the estimated total cost of a contract exceeds its estimated total revenue.\nStock Based Compensation\nWe recognize the expense related to the fair value of stock based compensation awards within the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. We use the fair value method for equity instruments granted to non-employees and use the Black-Scholes model for measuring the fair value. The stock based fair value compensation is determined as of the date of the grant or the date at which the performance of the services is completed (measurement date) and is recognized over the periods in which the related services are rendered.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740). Under ASC 740, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the income tax effects of differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their bases for income tax reporting. The Company's differences arise principally from the use of various accelerated and modified accelerated cost recovery system for income tax purposes versus straight line depreciation used for book purposes and from the utilization of net operating loss carry-forwards.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are the amounts by which the Company's future income taxes are expected to be impacted by these differences as they reverse. Deferred tax assets are based on differences that are expected to decrease future income taxes as they reverse. Correspondingly, deferred tax liabilities are based on differences that are expected to increase future income taxes as they reverse. Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements discusses the amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and also presents the impact of significant differences between financial reporting income and taxable income.\n 25 \nFor income tax purposes, the Company uses the percentage of completion method of recognizing revenues on long-term contracts which is consistent with the Company's financial reporting under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets consist principally of the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired (or goodwill), customer relationships, non-compete agreements and licenses. Goodwill was allocated to our reporting units based on the original purchase price allocation. Goodwill is not amortized and is evaluated for impairment annually or more often if circumstances indicate impairment may exist. Customer relationships, non-compete agreements, patents and licenses are being amortized on a straight-line basis over periods of 2 to 10 years. The Company amortizes its limited lived intangible assets using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit. We periodically evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets and take into account events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate that impairment exists.\nThe first step of the goodwill impairment test, used to identify potential impairment, compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value, which is based on future cash flows, exceeds the carrying amount, goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, the second step must be performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. The second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. At the end of each year, we evaluate goodwill on a separate reporting unit basis to assess recoverability, and impairments, if any, are recognized in earnings. An impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nWe operate two distinct business segments. Our Marine Technology Business designs and manufactures patented real time 3D sonar solutions and other leading products for subsea applications ( Products Segment\u201d). Our Marine Engineering Business supplies engineering services to prime defense contractors ( Services Segment\u201d).\nOur Products Segment sells its products and associated services to the offshore wind energy, dredging and marine construction, marine and port security, mining including deep sea mining, marine sciences sector and oil and gas sector. This segment generated approximately 61% and 50% of our total revenues for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nOur Services Segment largely sells its services into prime and sub-prime defense contractors. This segment generated approximately 39% and 50% of our total revenues for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This segment continues to be an important part of the Group's revenues plan and, in particular, our subsidiary Coda Octopus Colmek.\nComparison of fiscal year ended October 31, 2017 ( 2017 period\u201d) to fiscal year ended October 31, 2016 ( 2016 period\u201d)\nThroughout this discussion, the 2017 period\u201d means the fiscal year ended October 31, 2017. Similarly, the 2016 period\u201d means the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016.\nSee Segment information below for a full breakout of the financial performance of each Segment for the 2017 and 2016 periods, respectively.\nThe information provided below pertains to the consolidated analysis of both segments (Products and Services) operating in our Group.\n 26 \nRevenue: Total revenues in the 2017 and 2016 periods were $18,025,173 and $21,118,319, respectively, representing a 14.6% decrease in the 2017 period.\nThe reason for the decline in our revenues during the 2017 period is the delay by the new US administration in approving defense spending (and budget). This has resulted in prime defense contractors not finalizing contracts with Coda Octopus Colmek (a part of our Services Segment) that were anticipated in our Business Plan for the 2017 period. Accordingly, during the 2017 period, revenues generated by our Services segment were $7,038,905 as compared to $10,534,178 during the 2016 period (a decline of 33.2% (See break out in Segment Analysis on page of this report)). Although these opportunities which were projected in the 2017 period have not gone away, this segment continues to be impacted by the uncertainty around the timescales for the approval of the defense budget by the new administration.\nOur outlook for this segment in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 is that its results will be significantly impacted by this ongoing delay, thus resulting in an overall decline in the Group's revenues during the first quarter of 2018 fiscal year.\nDuring the 2017 period, the Company had one customer from whom it generated sales greater than 10% of net revenues. Revenue from this customer was $4,036,591, or 22% of net revenues during the period. Total accounts receivable from this customer at October 31, 2017 was $289,571 or 21% of accounts receivable.\nGross Margin: Margins were 66.4% in the 2017 period (gross profit of $11,967,725) compared to 59.9% (gross profit of $12,652,997) in the 2016 period representing an increase of 6.6 percentage points. The increase in gross margin reflects the different mix of sales in the 2017 period, in particular, the Products Segment generated more revenues than the Services Segment and the Products Segment in general yields a greater gross margin on the sale or rental of its products.\nResearch and Development (R&D): R&D expenditures increased by 36.2% from $1,013,125 in the 2016 period to $1,380,381 in the 2017 period and was in line with our budgetary plans for the 2017 period.\nThe increase in our R&D expenditure in the 2017 period reflects an increase in our R&D expenditure in the Services Segment.\nR&D expenditures in the Products Segment decreased by 9.2% from $1,013,125 in the 2016 period as compared to $919,863 in the 2017 period. In the 2018 fiscal year however, we would anticipate this category of expenditures to increase substantially in the Products Segment as we are investing in the advancement of our fourth generation of products ( 4G\u201d) and to this end, we plan to recruit up to 14 new members of staff in this segment as part of our efforts to advance our product development program. Our goal will be to bring more competitively priced and technologically advanced products in this range to the market under a 12-18 months product roll out plan. The first of our series of products in our 4G of products was launched on January 16, 2018. Nevertheless, it should be noted that we may incur significant research expenditures without realizing viable products or we may not be successful in the launch of new products.\nR&D expenditures in the Services Segment were $460,518 in the 2017 period compared to nil in the 2016 period. These expenditures were in line with our budgetary plans as we are investing significantly in the refreshing the Thermite\u00ae range of products which is a significant part of our growth strategy (Services Segment). The Thermite\u00ae is a product which we acquired from Quantum 3D in 2014 and it has a prestigious customer base. We believe that the technically refreshed Thermite presents a substantial opportunity to grow this part of our business.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG&A): SG&A expenditures for the 2017 period increased to $6,769,327 from $6,101,227 for the 2016 period, an increase of 11.0%. The increase in our SG&A expenditures in the 2017 period is broadly attributed to the increased costs associated with becoming a SEC reporting company and listing on the NASDAQ exchange. Approximately $100,000 of the increased amount in our SG&A expenditures constitutes non-recurring costs associated with these activities.\nKey Areas of SG&A Expenditure across the Group for the year ended October 31, 2017 compared to the year ended October 31, 2016\n\nAlthough there is a modest decrease in Wages and Salaries we would expect in the 2018 fiscal year this category to increase to reflect the investments we are making in bringing in more staff to expedite the advancement of our 4G products which we are developing.\nThe increase in our Legal and Professional Fees in the 2017 period is attributed to the increased costs associated with becoming a SEC reporting company and our listing on the NASDAQ.\nUpon surrender of our leased properties in Edinburgh, we would anticipate that the category of expenditures constituting Rent\u201d will decrease significantly.\nWe also expect that the category Marketing expenditures in the fiscal year 2018 will increase to reflect increased marketing efforts on our new generation of products both in the Products and Services Segment. Furthermore, the Products Segment will be demonstrating our products at the biggest Industry event in 2018 ( Oceanology 2018) and there are significant costs associated with these activities.\n 27 \nOperating Income: Operating Income for the 2017 period declined by 31.1% and was $3,818,017 as compared to $5,538,645 in the 2016 period.\nThe decrease in Operating Income in the 2017 period compared to the 2016 period is attributed to the decline in our revenues by 14.6% for the reasons discussed earlier, in conjunction with material increases in both our SG&A expenditures and our R&D expenditures by 11.8% and 36.2% respectively, in the 2017 period.\nInterest Expense: Interest expense during the 2017 period was $597,011 compared to $856,432 during the 2016 period, representing an overall 30.3% decrease.\nThis category of expenditure is related to interest payable under (i) Senior Secured Convertible Debentures (SSCD) which was entered into on or around February 21, 2007, where we paid six months of interest payments in the 2017 period. The amounts outstanding under the SSCD were repaid in full on or around April 28, 2017; and (ii) newly entered into Senior Secured Debentures with HSBC NA on or around April 28, 2017 and where we have paid six months interest in the 2017 period and (iii) interest payable on loan by the CEO to one of our subsidiaries, Coda Octopus Colmek. The reduction is due to the cancellation of the previous SSCD which attracted 8.5% interest per annum and the introduction of a more favorable interest rates of 4.56% now in place under the HSBC Senior Secured Debentures. Going forward on an annualized basis we would anticipate annual interest expenditures on the HSBC NA Debentures to fall and will be approximately $285,000 (in 2018) and $182,000 (2019), as under the repayment terms we are also repaying principal amounts. The amortization schedule for this loan is set out in Note 8 of the audited Consolidated Financial Statement of October 31, 2017 and 2016.\nOther Income: This category was $121,278 in the 2017 period as compared to $172,090 in the 2016 period representing a decrease of 29.5%. The make-up of this category is UK Value Added Tax rebates from purchases made outside of the European Union by our UK operations and is subject to fluctuations as it usually reflects Value Added Tax rebates (equivalent of the US Sales Tax) from purchases made outside of the European Union by our UK operations and changes according to the level of purchases we make outside of the European Union in the period.\nNet Income for the year ended October 31, 2017 compared to the year ended October 31, 2016\nNet Income for the 2017 period was $3,339,663 compared to $4,930,548 for the 2016 period, representing a decrease of 32.3%. Net Income fell due to the significant decline in our revenues in the 2017 period in conjunction with material increases in both our SG&A and R&D expenditures for the 2017 period. See earlier discussions in MD&A Section for the reasons revenues declined in the 2017 period and SG&A & R&D expenditures increased. The decline in revenues also resulted in the Services Segment breaking even in the 2017 period (See Segment Analysis section of this report) combined with material increases in both our SG&A and R&D expenditures in the 2017 period. See earlier discussions in the R&D and SG&A section of this MD&A report.\nComprehensive Income for the year ended October 31, 2017 compared to the year ended October 31, 2016\n\nFor the 2016 period we suffered a significant loss of $2,710,953 in foreign currency translation adjustments of the values of our UK assets included in our financial statements due to the depreciation of the value of the British pound, a part of the so-called Brexit effect. For the 2017 period we recorded a gain of $299,006 on foreign currency translation adjustments due to the British pound strengthening against the US dollar over the 2017 period.\nSince the UK decided to leave the European Union the British pound has been falling significantly against the US dollar (see Note 2 paragraph n of Notes to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements for October 31, 2017 and 2016 for fuller information regarding our Foreign Currency Translation policy).\nSegment Analysis\nWe are operating in two reportable segments, which are managed separately based upon fundamental differences in their operations. Segment operating income is total segment revenue reduced by operating expenses identifiable with the business segment. Overhead includes general corporate administrative costs.\n 28 \nThe Company evaluates performance and allocates resources based upon operating income. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of accounting policies.\nThere are inter-segment sales in the table below which have been eliminated from our financial statements. However, for the purpose of segment reporting, these are included in the table below only.\nThe following tables summarize certain balance sheet and statement of operations information by reportable segment for the financial years ending October 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n\n 29 \n\n 30 \nThe Company's reportable business segments operate in three geographic locations: the United States, Europe and Australia.\nInformation concerning principal geographic areas is presented below according to the area where the activity is taking place for the years ended October 31, 2017 and 2016 respectively:\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt October 31, 2017, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $36,982,937, working capital surplus of $11,140,403 and stockholders' equity of $13,827,420. For the period then ended, the Company generated cash flow from operations of $4,840,392.\nWe believe that our current level of cash and cash generation will be sufficient to meet our future short- and medium-term liquidity needs. At October 31, 2017, we had cash on hand of approximately $6.9 million and both billed and unbilled receivables of approximately $4.1 million. Our current cash balance represents approximately one-year of Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. The Company continues to critically evaluate the level of expenses that we incur and reduce those expenses as appropriate. See also Note 15 - Subsequent Events in our audited Consolidated Financial Statements - covering the recent private placement transaction completed on January 29, 2018. The proceeds will increase our liquidity and working capital resources.\nOur main liquidity issues are funding of our research and development program ( R&D\u201d) which requires significant expenditures in bringing on new skills and resources and incurring non-recoverable and non-recurring engineering costs for researching, developing and prototyping products; and managing our currency exposure because of our operations in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia and servicing our senior security debentures.\nOur Colmek subsidiary received a $1 million loan from the CEO of Coda to fund the purchase of long lead-time inventory (which are typically on between 12- 32 weeks lead time cycle) in order to be able to comply with delivery dates for contracts when they are secured. The repayment date of this loan has been extended to November 30, 2018.\nSubstantially all our properties are owned by the Company and there are no mortgage obligations on those properties.\nWe have a significant concern about adverse currency fluctuations and the effect that those currency fluctuations have on our operations and profitability. As mentioned previously, the United Kingdom's potential exit from the European Union ( Brexit\u201d) has had a significant negative effect on the value of the British pound versus the U. S. dollar. A significant portion of our business is in the United Kingdom and the substantial decrease in the value of the British pound is reflected in lower revenues for our product sales. In addition, all our loans are denominated in U. S. dollars, which means that the dollar value of those loans has effectively gone up since these are partially serviced with British Pounds. While we have chosen not to hedge any of our currency exposure, we continue to evaluate the need to do so and will consider a hedging strategy when, and if, appropriate.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash generated from operating activities for the year ended October 31, 2017 was $4,840,392. We recorded net income for the period of $3,339,663. Other items in uses and sources of funds from operations included non-cash charges related to depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation, which collectively totaled $1,057,684. Changes in operating assets increased net cash from operating activities by $1,224,062 and changes in current liabilities decreased net cash from operating activities by $701,784.\n 31 \nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used by investing activities for the year ended October 31, 2017 was $2,043,055 due to the sale and purchase of fixed assets.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended October 31, 2017 was $1,846,571 as a result of paying down the debt of the Company and redeeming the Series C preferred stock.\nSecured Promissory Note\nOn April 28, 2017, Coda Octopus Group, Inc. (the Company\u201d) together with its wholly owned US subsidiaries, Coda Octopus Products, Inc. and Coda Octopus Colmek, Inc. (together, the Subsidiaries\u201d), entered into a loan agreement with HSBC Bank NA (the Lender\u201d) for a loan in the principal amount of $8,000,000 (the Loan\u201d). The annual interest rate is fixed at 4.56%. Commencing on May 28, 2017 and continuing on the 28th day of each month thereafter, the Company is required to make monthly principal and interest payments of $149,350 until April 28, 2022 (making our annual payments under this Note $1,792,200). In addition, within 30 days after the delivery to the Lender of the Company's annual audited consolidated financial statements, the Company is required to make an annual principal payment of $700,000 during the term of the Loan. Such annual payments will reduce the balance of the principal outstanding. As a result, it is expected that the Loan will be repaid within a period of approximately 45 months. The Loan may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time subject to a break funding charge as detailed in the promissory note evidencing the Loan.\nThe obligations in connection with the repayment of the Loan are secured by all assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries. In addition, the repayment of the Loan is guaranteed by three of the Company's overseas subsidiaries.\nThe proceeds from the Loan were used to repay in its entirety the outstanding principal balance of $8,000,000 under secured debentures (the Debentures\u201d) that were issued by the Company in February 2007 and that were most recently held by CCM Holdings, LLC. ( CCM\u201d). In addition, accrued and unpaid interest under the said Debentures of approximately $1,133,261 was satisfied through the issuance to CCM of 1,000 shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001, with a stated value of $1,000 each (the Preferred Stock\u201d). The Company paid the balance in cash.\nAs of October 31, 2017, the Company is indebted to the lender in the amount of $7,279,353. See Note 8 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPrivate Placement\nOn January 29, 2018, the Company consummated the sale and issuance of 1,125,950 shares of its common stock in a private placement of shares of common stock at $4.40 per share (the Offering\u201d). Total gross proceeds from the Offering were $4,954,180. The purchase price per share was based on a 10% discount of the volume weighted average price (VWAP) of the common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market for the 30-consecutive trading-day period ending on January 22, 2018.\nUnder the terms of the Offering, the Company is required to file a re-sale registration statement prior to May 30, 2018 with respect to the shares issued in the Offering. For a period of 36 months, the investors also have the right to purchase, based on their pro-rata ownership of common stock, shares (or securities convertible into shares) offered in subsequent offerings, subject to certain limited exceptions.\nForeign Currency\nThe Company maintains its books in local currency: US Dollars for its US operations, Pounds Sterling for its United Kingdom operations, Norwegian and Danish Kroner for its Norwegian and Danish operations respectively and Australian Dollars for its Australian operations.\nFor the fiscal year ended 2017, 42% of the Company's operations were conducted inside the United States and 58% outside the United States through its wholly owned subsidiaries. As a result, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may significantly affect the Company's sales, profitability and financial position when the foreign currencies of its international operations are translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting. In addition, we are also subject to currency fluctuation risk with respect to certain foreign currency denominated receivables and payables. Although the Company cannot predict the extent to which currency fluctuations may affect the Company's business and financial position, there is a risk that such fluctuations will have an adverse impact on the Company's sales, profits and financial position. Because differing portions of our revenues and costs are denominated in foreign currency, movements could impact our margins by, for example, decreasing our foreign revenues when the dollar strengthens and not correspondingly decreasing our expenses. The Company does not currently hedge its currency exposure. In the future, we may engage in hedging transactions to mitigate foreign exchange risk.\n 32 \nThe translation of the Company's UK operations' British Pound denominated balance sheets and results of operations into US dollars was affected by changes in the average value of the US dollar against the British Pound. The average exchange rate during the 2017 period was $1.2829 USD to the GBP against $1.3860 during the 2016 period - a depreciation of the value of the GBP against the USD of 7.4%.\nThe translation of the Company's Australian operations' Australian Dollar denominated balance sheets and results of operations into US dollars was affected by changes in the average value of the US dollar against the Australian Dollar. The average exchange rate during the 2017 period was $0.7626 USD to the AUD against $0.7429 during the 2016 period - an appreciation of the value of the AUD against the USD of 2.6%.\nThe translation of the Company's Norwegian operation's Norwegian Kroner (NOK) denominated balance sheets and results of operations into US dollars has been affected by the currency fluctuations of the US dollar against the NOK from an average rate of $0.1189 during the 2016 period, to $0.1206 during the 2017 period - an appreciation of the value of the NOK against the USD of 1.4%. These are the values that have been used in the calculations below.\nWe have not included the Danish kroner in this schedule as there were no operations in the Danish subsidiary during the 2017 period.\nThe impact of these currency fluctuations on the 2017 period is shown below:\n\nThis table shows that the effect of constant exchange rates, versus the actual exchange rate fluctuations, decreased net income for the year by $173,835 and increased net assets by $916,891. All of these amounts are material to our overall financial results.\nAs a result of the decision by British voters to leave the European Union, we expect economic uncertainty to increase until the negotiations for the British exit have been completed and the relationship between the UK and the EU has been solidified. This uncertainty will most likely continue to have a profound effect on the value of the British Pound. Since approximately 50% of our revenues are transacted and generated in that British Pound, we expect our revenues to continue to be impacted by the adverse movement of the British Pound against the US Dollar. We also expect our direct costs of sales for components sourced outside of the UK for our UK operations to increase. Furthermore, our balance sheet will be affected since a significant part of our assets (fixed and current) are held in British Pounds by our UK subsidiaries.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off balance sheet arrangements.\nInflation\nThe effect of inflation on the Company's operating results was not significant during the 2017 period.\n 33 \nSeasonality\nResults of operations for our products segment are impacted by the offshore drilling season. During the winter months, when less offshore drilling takes place, demand for our oil and gas related technology is typically at its lowest.", "item_7_tables": "Table 52: <table> <tr> <td>Expenditure

involved in underwater technology and engineering services. Key takeaways from the report are:\n\n1. Forward-Looking Statements: The report contains forward-looking statements regarding industry prospects, anticipated future operations, and financial positions that are subject to uncertainty and may differ from current management expectations.\n\n2. General Overview: The company has two main segments: the Products Segment, focused on 3D sonar solutions for subsea applications, and the Services Segment, providing engineering services primarily to defense contractors. Global economic conditions, government spending on defense, and currency fluctuations significantly affect operations. Changes in the political climate, particularly budget approvals by the US administration, have impacted sales in the Services Segment.\n\n3. Financial Performance: The company saw a shift in its revenue generation from the Services Segment in recent years, with the Products Segment becoming more dominant due to a failure to approve the US defense budget. Competitive pressure in oil and gas sectors is impacting revenues and gross margins, despite the company's real-time 3D sonar technology providing significant advantages.\n   \n4. Market Expansion: There's progress in selling the sonar systems to various sectors, including mining and offshore wind energy, and rental services are growing as capital expenditures decline in the oil and gas market.\n\n5. Factors Affecting the Business: Various global factors, including the impact of Brexit, affect the company's financials and operations, particularly due to currency exchange rate fluctuations, as a significant percentage of revenues and costs are incurred outside the USA.\n\n6. Critical Accounting Policies: The financial statements are prepared under US GAAP, with revenue recognized based on contractual arrangements and delivery. The company also recognizes software license revenue upon delivery, subject to certain criteria.\n\n7. Results of Operations: The company operates two distinct segments with varying revenue streams and growth rates. There was a decrease in total revenue by 14.6% in 2017 due to political uncertainties around defense spending budgets.\n\n8. Liquidity and Capital Resources: The company believes it has sufficient cash to meet short- and medium-term needs, with an existing loan that can be repaid within approximately 45 months. The company does not currently hedge its currency exposure but is considering doing so in the future.\n\n9. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Seasonality: The report states there are no off-balance sheet arrangements and discusses the seasonality impact on the Products Segment related to offshore drilling cycles. \n\nThis analysis provides insight into the company\u2019s current financial condition, affected by internal operations and external economic and political factors."}
