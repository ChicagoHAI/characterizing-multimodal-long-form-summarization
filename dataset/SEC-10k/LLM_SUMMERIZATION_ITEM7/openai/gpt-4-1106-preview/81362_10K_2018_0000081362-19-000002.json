Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nExecutive Summary\nQuaker Chemical Corporation is a leading global provider of process fluids, chemical specialties, and technical expertise to a wide range of industries, including steel, aluminum, automotive, mining, aerospace, tube and pipe, cans, and others. For 100 years, Quaker has helped customers around the world achieve production efficiency, improve product quality, and lower costs through a combination of innovative technology, process knowledge, and customized services. Headquartered in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania USA, Quaker serves businesses worldwide with a network of dedicated and experienced professionals whose mission is to make a difference.\nThe Company delivered strong operating results in 2018 on solid net sales growth coupled with a higher gross margin year-over-year. Specifically, net sales increased 6% to $867.5 million in 2018 compared to $820.1 million in 2017 driven by volume growth of 3% and increases in selling price and product mix of 2%. This increase in net sales, coupled with a higher gross margin of 36.0% in 2018 compared to 35.5% in 2017, drove a 7% increase in the Company's gross profit year-over-year. The increase in the Company's current year gross margin was primarily driven by pricing initiatives and the mix of certain products sold which more than offset increases in raw material costs year-over-year. In addition, current year operating income as a percentage of sales benefited from the Company's continued discipline in managing its selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A\u201d).\nThe Company's 2018 net income and earnings per diluted share were $59.5 million and $4.45, respectively, compared to $20.3 million and $1.52 per diluted share, respectively, in 2017. During 2018, the Company incurred $19.5 million or $1.21 per diluted share of total costs associated with the Company's previously announced combination with Houghton International, Inc. ( Houghton\u201d) (herein referred to as the Combination\u201d), compared to $30.8 million or $1.90 per diluted share of total costs related to the Combination during 2017. The Company's 2018 and 2017 results were also impacted by the Company's initial fourth quarter of 2017 estimate of $22.2 million or $1.67 per diluted share and subsequent 2018 adjustments of $5.8 million or $0.43 per diluted share related to the 2017 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( U.S. Tax Reform\u201d). Excluding expenses related to the Combination, charges related to U.S Tax Reform and other non-core items in each period, the Company's strong current year operating performance coupled with a lower 2018 effective tax rate resulted in a 21% increase in its non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to $6.04 in 2018 compared to $5.01 in 2017. The Company's 2018 adjusted EBITDA was a record $125.6 million, an increase of 9% compared to $115.2 million in the prior year. These results were achieved despite a negative impact from foreign exchange on current year earnings of approximately $0.08 per diluted share, or 1%. See the Non-GAAP Measures section of this Item below, as well as other items discussed in the Company's Consolidated Operations Review in the Operations section of this Item, below.\nFrom a regional perspective, the Company's 2018 operating performance was highlighted by year-over-year operating earnings increases in its three largest regions. The Company's North America and Asia/Pacific regions had particularly strong operating earnings in 2018, increasing 14% and 16% year-over-year, respectively. North America's results were driven by net sales growth of 8% on higher volumes and selling price and product mix while Asia/Pacific had net sales growth of 7% primarily on higher volumes, with both regions also benefiting from higher gross margins year-over-year. The Company's Europe, Middle East and Africa ( EMEA\u201d) region benefited from the positive impact of foreign currency translation year-over-year and increases in selling price and product mix, as well as a higher gross margin in 2018 compared to 2017, which offset a decline in volume year-over-year primarily driven by an atypically high sales pattern in EMEA during the first quarter of 2017, a decrease in volume associated with a specific piece of business which the Company stopped selling during the middle of 2018 primarily due to its limited profitability, and a slowing of orders at the end of 2018 due to market challenges. The Company's smallest region, South America, had a relatively consistent level of operating earnings year-over-year as strong net sales growth from increases in volume and selling price and product mix as well as lower SG&A were offset by the significant negative impact of foreign currency translation. See the Reportable Operating Segments Review, in the Operations section of this Item, below.\nThe Company generated net operating cash flow of $78.8 million in 2018 compared to $64.8 million in 2017. The increase in net operating cash flow year-over-year was primarily due to the Company's solid current year operating performance. The key drivers of the Company's operating cash flow and overall liquidity are further discussed in the Company's Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this Item, below.\nOverall, the Company is pleased to have delivered another strong year. While operating conditions were mixed throughout all of its regions and foreign exchange became a headwind in the second half of 2018, the Company's continued market share gains drove solid volume and net sales growth that exceeded the Company's estimate of year-over-year growth in its end markets. In addition, the\nbenefit of current year pricing initiatives and the mix of products sold continued to outpace higher raw material costs and contributed to the Company's gross margin improvement compared to the prior year. These increases in the Company's operating performance coupled with a continued discipline in managing SG&A drove a 9% increase in adjusted EBITDA and, coupled with a lower effective tax rate, resulted in a 21% increase in non-GAAP earnings per diluted share compared to 2017.\nLooking forward to 2019, the Company estimates that it will receive final regulatory approval and close the Combination within the next few months. As previously disclosed, the Combination will approximately double the Company's annual sales and adjusted EBITDA, not including estimated synergies, which are expected to meet or exceed $45 million once fully achieved by the third year. Depending upon the exact timing of the Combination's close, the Company anticipates it will realize a portion of the Houghton sales and adjusted EBITDA in 2019.\nFor Quaker's current business, the Company expects some headwinds particularly in the early months of 2019, such as the impacts from a strong U.S. dollar and some base market challenges due to global economic uncertainty. However, the Company also expects continued market share gains to help offset these headwinds. Overall, the Company remains confident in its future given its modestly growing global end markets and continued market share gains and expects 2019 to be another good year for the current Quaker business.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nQuaker's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon Quaker's consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these financial statements requires Quaker to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, Quaker evaluates its estimates, including those related to customer sales incentives, product returns, bad debts, inventories, property, plant and equipment, investments, goodwill, intangible assets, income taxes, business combinations, restructuring, incentive compensation plans (including equity-based compensation), pensions and other postretirement benefits, contingencies and litigation. Quaker bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under such circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. However, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nQuaker believes the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements:\n1. Accounts receivable and inventory exposures - Quaker establishes allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of Quaker's customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. As part of its terms of trade, Quaker may custom manufacture products for certain large customers and/or may ship products on a consignment basis. Further, a significant portion of Quaker's revenues is derived from sales to customers in industries where companies have experienced past financial difficulties. If a customer bankruptcy occurs, then Quaker must judge the amount of proceeds, if any, that may ultimately be received through the bankruptcy or liquidation process. These matters may increase the Company's exposure, should a bankruptcy occur, and may require a write down or a disposal of certain inventory. Reserves for customers filing for bankruptcy protection are established based on a percentage of the amount outstanding at the bankruptcy filing date. However, initially establishing this reserve and the amount thereto is dependent on the Company's evaluation of likely proceeds to be received from the bankruptcy process, which could result in the Company recognizing minimal or no reserve at the date of bankruptcy. Large and/or financially distressed customers are generally reserved for on a specific review basis, while a general reserve is maintained for other customers based on historical experience. The Company's consolidated allowance for doubtful accounts was $5.2 million and $5.5 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company recorded expense to increase its provision for doubtful accounts by $0.5 million, $0.1 million and $1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Changing the amount of expense recorded to the Company's provisions by 10% would have increased or decreased the Company's pre-tax earnings by $0.1 million, less than $0.1 million and $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report.\n2. Environmental and litigation reserves - Accruals for environmental and litigation matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Accrued liabilities are exclusive of claims against third parties and are not discounted. Environmental costs and remediation costs are capitalized if the costs extend the life, increase the capacity or improve the safety or efficiency of the property from the date acquired or constructed, and/or mitigate or prevent contamination in the future. Estimates for accruals for environmental matters are based on a variety of potential technical solutions, governmental regulations and other factors, and are subject to a wide range of potential costs for remediation and other actions. A considerable amount of judgment is required in determining the most likely estimate within the range of total costs, and the factors determining this judgment may vary over time. Similarly, reserves for litigation and similar matters are based on a range of potential outcomes and require considerable judgment in determining the most probable outcome. If no amount within the range is considered more probable than any other amount, the Company accrues the lowest amount in that range in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. See Note 25 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report.\n3. Realizability of equity investments - Quaker holds equity investments in various foreign companies, where it has the ability to influence, but not control, the operations of the entity and its future results. Quaker would record an impairment charge to an investment if it believed a decline in value that was other than temporary occurred. Adverse changes in market conditions, poor operating results of underlying investments, devaluation of foreign currencies or other events or circumstances could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments, potentially leading to an impairment charge in the future. The carrying amount of the Company's equity investments as of December 31, 2018 was $21.3 million, which included three investments: $14.7 million for a 33% interest in Primex, Ltd. (Barbados); $6.2 million for a 50% interest in Nippon Quaker Chemical, Ltd. (Japan); and $0.4 million for a 50% interest in Kelko Quaker Chemical, S.A. (Panama), respectively. The Company also has a 50-50 joint venture in a Venezuelan affiliate, Kelko Quaker Chemical, S.A ( Kelko Venezuela\u201d). Due to heightened foreign exchange controls, current economic circumstances and other restrictions in Venezuela, during the third quarter of 2018 the Company concluded that it no longer had significant influence over this affiliate. Prior to this determination, the Company historically accounted for this affiliate under the equity method. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has no remaining carrying value for its investment in Kelko Venezuela. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report.\n4. Tax exposures, uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances - Quaker records expenses and liabilities for taxes based on estimates of amounts that will be determined as deductible in tax returns filed in various jurisdictions. The filed tax returns are subject to audit, which often occur several years subsequent to the date of the financial statements. Disputes or disagreements may arise during audits over the timing or validity of certain items or deductions, which may not be resolved for extended periods of time. Quaker also evaluates for uncertain tax positions on all income tax positions taken on previously filed tax returns or expected to be taken on a future tax return, which prescribes the recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return and, also, whether the benefits of tax positions are probable or if they will be more likely than not sustained upon audit based upon the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are determined to be more likely than not sustained upon audit, the Company would recognize the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement in the financial statements. For tax positions that are not determined to be more likely than not sustained upon audit, the Company would not recognize any portion of the benefit in its financial statements. In addition, the Company's continuing practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. Also, the Company would net its liability for unrecognized tax benefits against deferred tax assets related to net operating losses or other tax credit carryforwards if the uncertain tax position were settled for the presumed amount at the balance sheet date.\nQuaker also records valuation allowances when necessary to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While Quaker has considered future taxable income and employs prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, in the event Quaker were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should Quaker determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. Both determinations could have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as U.S. Tax Reform. Among other provisions, U.S. Tax Reform reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, implemented a new system of taxation for non-U.S. earnings which eliminates U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from certain foreign subsidiaries, and imposed a one-time tax on the deemed repatriation of undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries. The Securities and Exchange Commission issued guidance on accounting for the tax effects of U.S. Tax Reform and provided a one-year measurement period for companies to complete the accounting. Based on reasonable interpretations and assumptions with regard to various uncertainties and ambiguities in the application of certain provisions of U.S. Tax Reform and subsequent to numerous temporary regulations, notices, and other formal guidance published by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS\u201d), U.S. Treasury, and various state taxing authorities in 2018, the Company completed its accounting for the tax effects of U.S. Tax Reform as of December 22, 2018. It is possible that the IRS could issue subsequent guidance or take positions on audit that differ from the Company's interpretations and assumptions. The Company currently believes that subsequent guidance, or interpretations made by the IRS will not be materially different from the Company's application of the provisions of U.S. Tax Reform and would not have a material adverse effect on the Company's tax liabilities, earnings, or financial condition.\nPursuant to U.S. Tax Reform, specifically the one-time tax on deemed repatriation of foreign earnings, the Company has recorded a charge for U.S. income tax on its undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries; however, the Company could be subject to other taxes, such as withholding taxes and dividend distribution taxes if these undistributed earnings are ultimately remitted to the U.S. As a result of the impacts from U.S. Tax reform, the Company re-evaluated its global cash strategy, resulting in a change to its indefinite reinvestment assertion attributable to a portion of its undistributed foreign earnings, and recognized a deferred tax liability and corresponding deferred tax expense of $7.9 million as of December 31, 2018, which primarily represents the Company's estimate of the non-U.S. taxes the Company will incur to ultimately remit these earnings to the U.S. It is the Company's current intention to reinvest its additional undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries to support working capital needs and certain other growth initiatives. The amount of such undistributed earnings at December 31, 2018 was approximately $210.0 million. Any tax liability which might result from ultimate remittance of these earnings is expected to be substantially offset by foreign tax credits (subject to certain limitations). It is currently impractical to estimate any such incremental tax expense. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report.\n5. Goodwill and other intangible assets - The Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. This method requires the recording of acquired assets, including separately identifiable intangible assets, at their acquisition date fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. The determination of the estimated fair value of assets acquired requires management's judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, royalty rates, asset lives and market multiples, among other items. When necessary, the Company consults with external advisors to help determine fair value. For non-observable market values, the Company may determine fair value using acceptable valuation principles, including the excess earnings, relief from royalty, lost profit or cost methods.\nThe Company amortizes definite-lived intangible assets on a straight-line basis over their useful lives. Goodwill and intangible assets which have indefinite lives are not amortized and are required to be assessed at least annually for impairment. The Company compares the assets' fair value to their carrying value, primarily based on future discounted cash flows, in order to determine if an impairment charge is warranted. The estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance. Assumptions used in these forecasts are consistent with internal planning, but the actual cash flows could differ from management's estimates due to changes in business conditions, operating performance, and economic conditions. The Company's assumed weighted average cost of capital ( WACC\u201d) and estimated future net operating profit after tax ( NOPAT\u201d) by reporting unit are particularly important in determining estimated future cash flows.\nThe Company completed its annual impairment assessment during the fourth quarter of 2018, and no impairment charge was warranted. Furthermore, the estimated fair value of each of the Company's reporting units substantially exceeded its carrying value, with none of the Company's reporting units at risk for failing step one of the goodwill impairment test. The Company's consolidated goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were $84.4 million and $87.1 million, respectively. The Company used a WACC of approximately 9%, and at October 1, 2018, this assumption would have had to increase by more than 229% before any of the Company's reporting units would fail step one of the impairment analysis. Further, at October 1, 2018, the Company's estimate of future NOPAT by reporting unit would have had to decrease by more than 75% before any of the Company's reporting units would be considered potentially impaired. See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report.\n6. Postretirement benefits - The Company provides certain defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefits to current employees, former employees and retirees. Independent actuaries, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, perform the required valuations to determine benefit expense and, if necessary, non-cash charges to equity for additional minimum pension liabilities. Critical assumptions used in the actuarial valuation include the weighted average discount rate, including the use of a split discount rate (spot-rate approach) for the U.S. plans and certain foreign plans, rates of increase in compensation levels, and expected long-term rates of return on assets. If different assumptions were used, additional pension expense or charges to equity might be required.\nThe Company's primary noncontributory U.S. pension plan (the U.S. Pension Plan\u201d) has a November 30 year-end and a measurement date of December 31. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company began the process of terminating the U.S. Pension Plan after receiving Board of Director approval to do so. The Company expects to record a pension settlement charge at plan termination. This settlement charge will include the immediate recognition into expense of the unrecognized losses within accumulated other comprehensive loss ( AOCI\u201d) on the balance sheet as of the plan termination date. The Company does not have a current estimate for this future settlement charge, however, the gross AOCI related to this plan was approximately $19 million as of December 31, 2018. The Company currently estimates that the U.S. Pension Plan termination will be completed during 2020. See Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report.\nThe following table highlights the potential impact on the Company's pre-tax earnings due to changes in assumptions with respect to the Company's pension plans, based on assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2018:\nTable 19: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1/2 Percentage Point Increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1/2 Percentage Point Decrease\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in millions)\n</td> <td> Foreign\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> U.S.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Foreign\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> U.S.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Discount rate (1)\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.7)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected rate of return on plan assets (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.8)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) The weighted-average discount rate used to determine net periodic benefit costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 2.33% for Foreign plans and 3.44% for U.S. plans.\n(2) The weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets used to determine net periodic benefit costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 2.22% for Foreign plans and 5.95% for U.S. plans.\n7. Restructuring and other related liabilities - A restructuring related program may consist of charges for employee severance, rationalization of manufacturing facilities and other related expenses. To account for such, the Company applies the Financial Accounting Standards Board's guidance regarding exit or disposal cost obligations. This guidance requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred, is estimable, and payment is probable. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nSee Note 3 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report for a discussion regarding recently issued accounting standards.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt December 31, 2018, Quaker had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $124.4 million, including $20.3 million of restricted cash. Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was approximately $111.1 million at December 31, 2017, which included $21.2 million of restricted cash. The inclusion of restricted cash in total cash on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows is the result of a change in presentation required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The $13.4 million increase was the net result of $78.8 million of cash provided by operating activities offset by $12.4 million of cash used in investing activities, $46.9 million of cash used in financing activities and a $6.1 million negative impact due to the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $78.8 million in 2018 compared to $64.8 million in 2017. The $14.0 million increase was primarily due to increased cash generation as a result of the Company's strong year-over-year operating performance growth as well as a $4.1 million second quarter of 2018 cash dividend received from its equity investment, Primex, Ltd ( Primex\u201d), compared to no dividend received in the prior year. The Company's level of cash invested in working capital was higher in 2018 compared to 2017, including increased accounts receivables related to higher net sales year-over-year. Also, the Company recorded a significant collection of receivables from a certain customer late in the fourth quarter of 2017 which was uncommon and did not recur in 2018. In addition, the Company recorded higher cash outflows from inventory in 2018 as the Company re-stocked inventory levels throughout 2018 to a level sufficient to address increased customer demand compared to lower inventory levels held at the end of 2017. Operating cash flow related to current and non-current estimated taxes on income were impacted by additional tax payments related to U.S. Tax Reform during 2018. The Company's operating cash flows in 2018 and 2017 were also impacted by the timing and amount of combination-related expenses and associated cash payments, described below. Finally, 2017 included restructuring payments made as part of the Company's global restructuring program initiated in the fourth quarter of 2015 and completed during the first half of 2017, described below.\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased from $14.6 million in 2017 to $12.4 million in 2018, primarily due to lower payments for acquisitions in the current year. During 2017, the Company had cash outflows of $5.4 million for the acquisition of assets associated with a business that markets, sells and manufactures certain metalworking fluids, whereas during 2018, the Company paid $0.5 million for certain formulations and product technology in the mining industry. In accordance with the terms of that acquisition agreement, an additional $0.5 million of the purchase price was paid during the first quarter of 2019. In addition, the Company had higher cash proceeds from dispositions of assets during 2017 as compared to 2018, primarily as a result of $1.4 million of cash proceeds received during the fourth quarter of 2017 for the disposition of a held-for-sale asset compared to $0.6 million of cash proceeds received during the second quarter of 2018. These lower investing cash flows were partially offset by slightly higher additions to property, plant and equipment during 2018 as compared to 2017, primarily due to an increase in spending related to a new manufacturing facility in India that is expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2019.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $46.9 million in 2018 compared to $55.2 million in 2017. The $8.3 million decrease in cash outflows was primarily due to $31.8 million of cash used in the fourth quarter of 2017 to purchase the remaining noncontrolling interest in the Company's India affiliate. These impacts of lower 2018 cash outflows were partially offset by higher repayments of long-term debt year-over-year, with repayments of $26.8 million during 2018 compared to repayments of $2.9 million during 2017. Also, during 2018, one of the Company's less than 100% owned consolidated affiliates made a distribution to the noncontrolling affiliate shareholder of $0.9 million. There were no similar distributions during 2017. In addition, the Company paid $19.3 million in cash dividends during 2018, a $0.7 million increase in cash dividends compared to the prior year.\nThe Company's primary credit facility ( the Credit Facility\u201d) is a $300.0 million syndicated multicurrency credit agreement with a group of lenders. The maximum amount available under the Credit Facility can be increased to $400.0 million at the Company's option if the lenders agree and the Company satisfies certain conditions. Borrowings under the Credit Facility generally bear interest at a base rate or LIBOR rate plus a margin. The Credit Facility has certain financial and other covenants, with the key financial covenant requiring that the Company's consolidated total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio cannot exceed 3.50 to 1. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company's consolidated total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was below 1.0 to 1, and the Company was also in compliance with all of its other covenants. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Credit Facility was amended and restated to extend the maturity date to March 15, 2020. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had total credit facility borrowings of $24.0 million and $48.5 million, respectively, primarily under the Credit Facility. The Company's other debt obligations as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were primarily industrial development bonds, including a $5.0 million industrial development bond which matured and was paid off during the fourth quarter of 2018, and municipality-related loans.\nQuaker's management approved a global restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of 2015 (the 2015 Program\u201d) to reduce its operating costs. The Company completed all of the initiatives under the 2015 Program during the first half of 2017. The Company did not incur related costs in 2018 and does not expect to incur any further restructuring charges under this program. During 2017, the company incurred $0.7 million of cash payments utilizing operating cash flows for the settlement of these restructuring liabilities.\nOn April 4, 2017, Quaker entered into a share purchase agreement with Gulf Houghton Lubricants, Ltd. to purchase the entire issued and outstanding share capital of Houghton. The shares will be bought for aggregate purchase consideration consisting of: (i) $172.5 million in cash; (ii) a number of shares of common stock, $1.00 par value per share, of the Company comprising 24.5% of the common stock outstanding upon the closing of the Combination; and (iii) the Company's assumption of Houghton's net indebtedness as of the closing of the Combination, which was approximately $690 million at signing. See Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn connection with the Combination, the Company secured $1.15 billion in commitments from Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank to fund the purchase consideration and provide additional liquidity, and has since replaced these commitments with a syndicated bank agreement ( the New Credit Facility\u201d) with a group of lenders for $1.15 billion. The New Credit Facility is contingent upon and will not be effective until the closing of the Combination. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company extended the bank commitment through March 15, 2019. The New Credit Facility is comprised of a $400.0 million multicurrency revolver, a $600.0 million USD term loan and a $150.0 million EUR equivalent term loan, each with a five-year term from the date the New Credit Facility becomes effective. The maximum amount available under the New Credit Facility can be increased by $200.0 million at the Company's option if the lenders agree and the Company satisfies certain conditions. Borrowings under the New Credit Facility will bear interest at a base rate, LIBOR rate plus a margin or Euribor rate plus a margin, and the Company currently estimates the annual floating rate cost will be in the 3.75% to 4.0% range based on current market interest rates. The New Credit Facility will be subject to certain financial and other covenants, including covenants that the Company's consolidated net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio cannot exceed 4.25 to 1 and the Company's consolidated adjusted EBITDA to interest expense ratio cannot be less than 3.0 to 1. Both the USD and EUR equivalent term loans will have quarterly principal amortization during their respective five-year terms, with 5.0% amortization of the principal balance due in years 1 and 2, 7.5% in year 3, and 10.0% in years 4 and 5, with the remaining principal amounts due at maturity. Until closing, the Company will incur certain interest costs paid to maintain the bank commitment ( ticking fees\u201d), which began to accrue on September 29, 2017. The ticking fees bear an interest rate of 0.30% per annum.\nThe Company incurred $19.5 million of total combination-related expenses during 2018, which includes approximately $3.5 million of ticking fees as well as a $0.6 million gain on the sale of a held-for-sale asset, described in the Non-GAAP measures section of this Item below. The Company had net cash outflows related to these costs of approximately $16.8 million during 2018. Comparatively, during 2017, combination-related expenses totaled $30.8 million, including $0.9 million of ticking fees, with cash outflows related to these costs of approximately $25.9 million. The Company currently estimates it will incur additional costs and have associated cash outflows of approximately $25 to $30 million through closing of the Combination for similar combination-related expenses, including cash payments for bank fees which we expect to capitalize. In addition, post-closing of the combination, the Company expects it will incur additional costs and make associated cash payments to integrate the Company and Houghton and to begin realizing the Combination's total anticipated cost synergies, which we currently estimate to meet or exceed $45 million. The timing and an accurate range of these additional costs and cash payments post-closing are not estimable at this time. However, based on market precedents, the Company currently projects these costs to approximate one times anticipated synergies, and the Company expects them to be incurred over a three-year period post-close.\nThe Company received regulatory approval for the Combination from China and Australia in 2017. In addition, at a shareholder meeting held during 2017, the Company's shareholders overwhelmingly approved the issuance of the new shares of the Company's common stock at closing of the Combination. The European Commission ( EC\u201d) conditionally approved the Combination in December 2018. Quaker expects final approval from the EC once the final purchase agreement is in place between Quaker, Houghton, and the buyer of the divested product lines. Quaker continues to be in productive discussions with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission ( FTC\u201d), although the process is taking longer than anticipated. Given the time lapse since Quaker's initial filing, the FTC requested updated information as part of their approval process late in the fourth quarter of 2018. In addition, the government shutdown in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2019 extended the timeline to receive the final approval. The proposed remedy being discussed with the FTC continues to be consistent with Quaker's previous guidance that the total divested product lines will be approximately 3% of the combined company's revenue. Given current information, the Company estimates that FTC and EC final approval and closing of the combination will occur within the next few months. Given these contingencies and the overall timing of the Combination, the Company has not recorded any estimated costs for additional expenses that the Company expects, but had yet to incur as of December 31, 2018, related to the Combination.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company's gross liability for uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, was $8.5 million. The Company cannot determine a reliable estimate of the timing of cash flows by period related to its uncertain tax position liability. However, should the entire liability be paid, the amount of the payment may be reduced by up to $4.9 million as a result of offsetting benefits in other tax jurisdictions. Related to the impact of U.S. Tax Reform, as of December 31, 2018, the Company's remaining gross deemed repatriation transition tax ( Transition Tax\u201d) on previously untaxed accumulated and current earnings and profits of certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries is $8.9 million. The Company elected to pay the U.S. federal Transition Tax over 8 years, as allowed, $7.6 million of which is considered a long-term tax payable due after 2019 with the remainder due during 2019, as presented in the contractual obligations table, below.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company began the process of terminating the U.S. Pension Plan after receiving the Company's Board of Director approval to do so. Participants of the U.S. Pension Plan will have their benefits either converted into a lump sum cash payment or an annuity contract placed with an insurance carrier. The U.S. Pension Plan is fully-funded on a U.S. GAAP basis. In order to terminate the plan in accordance with IRS and pension benefit guaranty corporation requirements, the Company will be required to fully fund the plan on a termination basis and will commit to contribute the additional assets necessary, if any, to do so. The amount necessary to do so is not yet known but is currently estimated to be between $0 and $10 million. The Company currently estimates that the U.S. Pension Plan termination will be completed during 2020. See Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report.\nThe Company believes it is capable of supporting its operating requirements and funding its business objectives, including but not limited to, payments of dividends to shareholders, costs related to the Combination, pension plan contributions, capital expenditures, other business opportunities and other potential contingencies, through internally generated funds supplemented with debt or equity as needed.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flows in future periods. Pension and other postretirement plan contributions beyond 2019 are not determinable since the amount of any contribution is heavily dependent on the future economic environment and investment returns on pension trust assets. The timing of payments related to other long-term liabilities which consists primarily of deferred compensation agreements, also cannot be readily determined due to their uncertainty. Interest obligations on the Company's long-term debt and capital leases assume the current debt levels will be outstanding for the entire respective period and apply the interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2018.\nTable 20: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2024 and\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Beyond\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36,694\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,714\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,407\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,279\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,635\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,779\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transition Tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,439\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pension and other postretirement plan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> contributions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,675\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,675\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other long-term liabilities (See Note 21 of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,510\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,510\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 96,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,145\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,592\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,811\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 29,414\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-GAAP Measures\nIncluded in this Form 10-K filing are two non-GAAP (unaudited) financial measures: non-GAAP earnings per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information as they enhance a reader's understanding of the financial performance of the Company, are more indicative of future operating performance of the Company, and facilitate a better comparison among fiscal periods, as the non-GAAP financial measures exclude items that are not considered core to the Company's operations. Non-GAAP results are presented for supplemental informational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP.

The Company holds a 33% investment in and has significant influence over Primex, and therefore accounts for this interest under the equity method of accounting. The income attributable to Primex is not indicative of the future operating performance of the Company and is not considered core to the Company's operations. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report.\n(b) Restructuring credit represents the credit recorded by the Company as part of finalizing a global restructuring program which was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2015. This credit is not indicative of the future operating performance of the Company. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report.\n(c) Houghton combination-related expenses include certain legal, environmental, financial, and other advisory and consultant costs incurred in connection with the strategic evaluation of, diligence on, and execution of the definitive agreement to combine with Houghton, as well as regulatory and shareholder approvals and integration planning associated with the pending Combination. These costs are not indicative of the future operating performance of the Company. Certain of these costs were considered non-deductible for the purpose of determining the Company's effective tax rate and, therefore, the earnings per diluted share amount reflects this impact. Also, included in the caption Houghton combination-related expenses for 2018 is a $0.6 million gain on the sale of a held-for-sale asset recorded in Other expense, net, in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. In addition, during 2018, the Company incurred approximately $3.5 million of ticking fees to maintain the bank commitment related to the pending Combination. Comparatively, the Company began incurring ticking fees as of September 29, 2017 and recognized $0.9 million during 2017. These interest costs are included in the caption Houghton combination-related expenses in the reconciliation of GAAP earnings per diluted share attributable to Quaker Chemical Corporation common shareholders to Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share above but are included in the caption Interest expense in the reconciliation of Net income attributable to Quaker Chemical Corporation to Adjusted EBITDA above. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report.\n(d) U.S. Tax Reform charges, net, represent the tax expense incurred by the Company related to its initial 2017 estimates and subsequent 2018 adjustments to adopt U.S. Tax Reform. The 2017 tax expense includes the Company's estimated impact of the Transition Tax, net of eliminating U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from certain foreign subsidiaries in 2017, as well as the impact of revaluing certain of the Company's U.S. deferred tax balances from 35% to the new 21% U.S. corporate tax rate. The 2018 tax expense includes certain adjustments recorded by the Company as a result of changes to the Company's initial fourth quarter of 2017 estimates. Specifically, the Company has adjusted the initial amount estimated for the one-time charge on the gross deemed repatriation Transition Tax on previously untaxed accumulated and current earnings and profits of certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries, as well as updated its assertion related to permanent reinvestment of accumulated earning and profits of certain of these foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the Company has adjusted its initial estimate of the impact from certain internal revenue code changes associated with the deductibility of certain executive compensation. All of these adjustments were based on guidance issued during 2018 and 2017 by the IRS, the U.S. Treasury and various state taxing authorities and were the result of specific one-time events that are not indicative of future operating performance of the Company. U.S. Tax Reform charges, net, are included within Taxes on income before equity in net income of associated companies in the reconciliation of Net income attributable to Quaker Chemical Corporation to Adjusted EBITDA. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report.\n(e) U.S. pension plan settlement charge represents the expense recorded for the settlement of one of the Company's U.S. pension plans vested terminated participants. This settlement charge represents the immediate recognition into expense of a portion of the unrecognized loss within AOCI on the balance sheet in proportion to the share of the projected benefit obligation that was settled by these payments. This charge was the result of a specific one-time event and is not indicative of the future operating performance of the Company. See Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report.\n(f) Cost streamlining initiative represents expenses associated with certain actions taken to reorganize the Company's corporate staff. Overall, these costs are non-core and are indirect operating expenses that are not attributable to the product sales of any respective reportable operating segment, and, therefore, are not indicative of the future operating performance of the Company.\n(g) Loss on disposal of held-for-sale asset represents a one-time charge to write down the value of a held-for-sale asset at the Company's India affiliate to its fair value. This charge was the result of a specific one-time event and is not indicative of the future operating performance of the Company. See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report.\n(h) Insurance insolvency recovery represents income associated with cash receipts from an insolvent insurance carrier for previously submitted claims by an inactive subsidiary of the Company. This other income is not indicative of the future operating performance of the Company. See Notes 8 and 25 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report.\n(i) Gain on liquidation of an inactive legal entity represents the decrease in historical cumulative currency translation adjustments associated with an inactive legal entity which was closed during the third quarter of 2018. These cumulative currency translation adjustments were the result of remeasuring the legal entity's monetary assets and liabilities to the applicable published exchange rates and were a component of AOCI, which was included in total shareholder's equity on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. As required under U.S. GAAP, when a legal entity is liquidated, any amount attributable to that legal entity and accumulated in the currency translation adjustment component of equity is required to be removed from equity and reported as part of the gain or loss on liquidation of the legal entity during the period in which the liquidation occurs. This recognized gain is not indicative of the future operating performance of the Company. See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report.\n(j) Currency conversion impacts of hyper-inflationary economies represents the foreign currency remeasurement impacts associated with the Company's Venezuelan and Argentina affiliates whose local economies are designated as hyper-inflationary under U.S. GAAP. An entity which operates within an economy deemed to be hyper-inflationary under U.S. GAAP is required to remeasure its monetary assets and liabilities to the applicable published exchange rates and record the associated gains or losses resulting from the remeasurement directly to the Consolidated Statements of Income. Venezuela's economy has been considered hyper-inflationary under U.S. GAAP since 2010 while Argentina's economy has been considered hyper-inflationary beginning July 1, 2018. The charges incurred related to the immediate recognition of foreign currency remeasurement in the Consolidated Statements of Income associated with these entities are not indicative of the future operating performance of the Company. See Notes 8 and 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appear in Item 8 of this Report.\n(k) Within the Company's calculation of Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share above, each reconciling item includes the impact of any current and deferred income tax expense (benefit) as applicable. The income tax expense (benefit) related to these items was determined utilizing the applicable rates in the taxing jurisdictions in which these adjustments occurred.\n(l) The Company calculates Adjusted EBITDA margin as the percentage of Adjusted EBITDA to consolidated net sales.\nOperations\nConsolidated Operations Review - Comparison of 2018 with 2017\nNet sales grew $47.4 million or 6% in 2018, increasing to $867.5 million compared to $820.1 million in 2017. The Company's 2018 net sales benefited from increases in volume of 3%, selling price and product mix of 2%, as well as a positive impact from foreign currency translation of less than 1% or $3.7 million.\nCost of goods sold ( COGS\u201d) in 2018 of $555.2 million increased 5% from $528.6 million in 2017. The increase in COGS was primarily due to the increase in product volumes, noted above, the impact of certain raw material cost increases, changes in product mix and the negative impact of foreign currency translation year-over-year.\nGross profit in 2018 increased $20.8 million or 7% compared to 2017, primarily driven by the increase in net sales and product volumes, noted above, as well as a higher gross margin of 36.0% in 2018 compared to 35.5% in 2017. The increase in the Company's gross margin in 2018 was primarily driven by pricing initiatives and the mix of certain products sold which more than offset increases in raw material costs.\nSG&A in 2018 increased $9.1 million compared to 2017 due to higher labor-related costs, primarily from annual merit increases and incentive-based compensation due to the Company's strong operating performance, as well as the negative impact from foreign currency translation. These increases year-over-year were partially offset by a first quarter of 2017 cost streamlining initiative described in the Non-GAAP measures section of this Item, above.\nDuring 2018, the Company incurred $16.7 million of costs related to its previously announced pending Combination with Houghton, described in the Non-GAAP measures section of this Item, above. Comparatively, the Company incurred $29.9 million of similar combination-related expenses in 2017 as well as certain due diligence-related costs.\nOperating income in 2018 was $87.8 million compared to $62.7 million in 2017. The increase in operating income was due to strong net sales and gross profit increases as well as lower Houghton combination-related expenses, noted above, partially offset by an increase in SG&A not related to the pending Houghton combination.\nThe Company had other expense, net, of $0.6 million in 2018 compared to $0.7 million in 2017. The decrease in other expense, net, includes both a $1.9 million settlement charge in one of the Company's U.S. pension plans and a $0.1 million loss on the disposal of a held for sale asset in 2017, as well as a 2018 gain of $0.6 million on the sale of a held-for-sale asset. The positive year-over-year impact of these items was partially offset by $0.5 million lower year-over-year cash proceeds received from an insolvent insurance carrier with respect to previously filed recovery claims by an inactive subsidiary of the Company. In addition to all of these items, which are described in the Non-GAAP measures section of this Item, above, the Company also had foreign currency transaction losses in 2018 compared to foreign currency transaction gains in 2017. The Company's 2018 foreign currency transaction losses included both recurring transactional activity as well as foreign currency transaction losses of approximately $0.4 million related to the Company's Argentina subsidiary and a foreign currency transaction gain of approximately $0.4 million related to the liquidation of an inactive legal entity, both of which are described in the Non-GAAP measures section of this Item, above. Lastly, the Company had a decrease in receipts of local municipality-related grants in one of the Company's regions year-over-year.\nInterest expense increased $2.3 million year-over-year, primarily due to higher 2018 costs incurred to maintain the bank commitment for the pending Houghton Combination, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense due to lower average outstanding borrowings on the Company's existing credit facility during 2018 compared to 2017. Interest income was $0.4 million lower in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to changes in the level of the Company's invested cash in certain regions with higher returns as well as a decrease in interest received on certain tax-related credits year-over-year.\nThe Company's effective tax rates for 2018 and 2017 were 30.1% and 68.7%, respectively. The Company's elevated 2018 and 2017 effective tax rates were impacted by its initial estimate and subsequent adjustments related to U.S. Tax Reform, as well as certain non-deductible Houghton combination-related expenses in both years, described in the Non-GAAP measures section of this Item, above. Excluding these items in each period, the Company estimates that its 2018 and 2017 effective tax rates would have been approximately 22% and 27%, respectively. The decrease in the Company's effective tax rate year-over-year was primarily due to a shift in earnings to lower tax jurisdictions and a lower U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% in 2018 compared to 35% in 2017. The Company has experienced and expects to continue to experience volatility in its effective tax rates due to several factors, including the timing of tax audits and the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations as they relate to uncertain tax positions, the unpredictability of the timing and amount of certain incentives in various tax jurisdictions, the treatment of certain acquisition-related costs and the timing and amount of certain share-based compensation-related tax benefits, among other factors.\nEquity in net income of associated companies ( equity income\u201d) decreased $1.5 million in 2018 compared to 2017. The decrease was primarily due to lower earnings from the Company's interest in a captive insurance company in 2018, partially offset by higher currency conversion charges in 2017 related to the Company's hyper-inflationary Venezuelan affiliate, both described in the Non-GAAP measures section of this Item, above.\nThe Company had a $1.7 million decrease in net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to the Company's purchase of the remaining interest in its India joint venture during December 2017.\nForeign exchange negatively impacted the Company's 2018 earnings by approximately 1% or $0.08 per diluted share, driven by the negative impact of net foreign currency transaction losses year-over-year, noted above, partially offset by a positive impact from foreign currency translation.\nConsolidated Operations Review - Comparison of 2017 with 2016\nNet sales in 2017 of $820.1 million increased 10% compared to net sales of $746.7 million in 2016. The $73.4 million increase in net sales was the result of a 6% increase in organic volumes, a 1% or $10.7 million increase from sales attributable to the Company's 2016 acquisition of Lubricor Inc. and its affiliate entities ( Lubricor\u201d), a 2% increase due to changes in selling price and product mix and the positive impact of foreign currency translation of $4.9 million or 1%.\nCOGS in 2017 of $528.6 million increased 13% from $466.6 million in 2016. The increase in COGS was primarily due to the increase in product volumes, noted above, as well as additional COGS attributed to the Company's 2016 acquisition of Lubricor, the impact of certain raw material cost increases, changes in product mix and the negative impact of foreign currency translation year-over-year.\nGross profit in 2017 increased $11.4 million or 4% compared to 2016, primarily driven by the increase in sales volumes, noted above, partially offset by a lower gross margin of 35.5% in 2017 compared to 37.5% in 2016. The decrease in the Company's gross margin in 2017 was primarily due to higher raw material costs compared to 2016 and a change in the mix of certain products sold.\nSG&A in 2017 increased $5.1 million compared to 2016 primarily due to additional SG&A associated with the Company's 2016 Lubricor acquisition, an increase due to the impact of foreign currency translation, higher labor-related costs primarily due to annual compensation increases and incentive compensation, as well as a first quarter of 2017 cost streamlining initiative, described in the Non-GAAP measures section of this Item, above. These increases to SG&A were partially offset by decreases as a result of certain cost savings efforts, including the impact of the 2015 global restructuring program in 2017.\nThe Company substantially completed the 2015 global restructuring program during 2016 and recognized a restructuring credit of $0.4 million during the fourth quarter of 2016 to update its initial estimates for employee separation costs. There were no comparable restructuring costs or credits during 2017.\nDuring 2017, the Company incurred $29.9 million of costs related to its previously announced Combination with Houghton, described in the Non-GAAP measures section of this Item, above. The Company incurred $1.5 million of similar combination-related expenses in 2016.\nOperating income in 2017 was $62.7 million compared to $85.4 million in 2016. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to the higher Houghton combination-related expenses along with slightly higher levels of SG&A not related to the Houghton Combination, which more than offset gross profit increases on strong volume growth, noted above.\nThe Company had other expense, net, of $0.7 million in 2017 compared to $0.5 million in 2016. The increase in other expense, net, was primarily driven by a second quarter of 2017 U.S. pension plan settlement charge and a fourth quarter of 2017 loss on the disposal of a held-for-sale asset, partially offset by income associated with an insurance insolvency recovery in the fourth quarter of 2017, all of which are described in the Non-GAAP measures section of this Item, above. In addition, the Company had higher foreign currency transaction gains realized in 2017 compared to 2016 and an increase in receipts of local municipality-related grants in one of the Company's regions year-over-year.\nInterest expense increased $1.0 million year-over-year, primarily due to costs incurred to maintain the committed capital for the pending Houghton Combination. Interest income increased $0.5 million in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to an increase in the level of the Company's invested cash in certain regions with higher returns.\nThe Company's effective tax rates for 2017 and 2016 were 68.7% and 27.6%, respectively. The primary drivers of the increase in the Company's effective tax rate during 2017 were the impact of certain non-deductible Houghton combination-related expenses as well as $22.2 million of charges related to U.S. Tax Reform, described in the Non-GAAP measures section of this Item, above. The Company estimates that its 2017 effective tax rate would have been approximately 27%, without the impact of U.S. Tax Reform and non-deductible Houghton combination-related expenses. These increases to the 2017 effective tax rate were partially offset by the favorable impact of tax benefits for deductions in excess of compensation cost associated with stock option exercises and restricted stock vesting in 2017. In 2016, there were minimal non-deductible Houghton combination-related expenses, no charges similar to those of the 2017 U.S. Tax Reform and no comparable share-based compensation-related tax benefits. Also, in both 2017 and 2016, the Company's mix of foreign earnings in jurisdictions with lower effective tax rates impacted each year's tax expense.\nEquity income increased $1.0 million in 2017 compared to 2016. The increase in equity income was primarily due to higher earnings from the Company's interest in a captive insurance company in 2017. In addition, the Company recorded hyper-inflationary accounting currency conversion charges in both 2017 and 2016, respectively, associated with the Company's Venezuela affiliate. The Company's interest in a captive insurance company and the currency conversion charges recorded are described in the Non-GAAP measures section of this Item, above.\nThe Company had a $0.4 million increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to an increase in performance from certain consolidated affiliates in the Company's Asia/Pacific region partially offset by the impact of the Company's purchase of the remaining interest in its India joint venture in December 2017.\nForeign exchange in total had minimal impact on the Company's 2017 earnings, as a negative impact from foreign currency translation of less than 1% or $0.01 per diluted share and the Venezuela hyper-inflationary currency conversion charges, noted above, were offset by the positive impact of higher foreign currency transaction gains year-over-year.\nReportable Operating Segment Review - Comparison of 2018 with 2017\nThe Company sells its industrial process fluids, chemical specialties and technical expertise to a wide range of industries in a global product portfolio throughout its four segments: (i) North America, (ii) EMEA, (iii) Asia/Pacific and (iv) South America.\nNorth America\nNorth America represented approximately 44% of the Company's consolidated net sales in 2018. The segment's net sales were $383.5 million, an increase of $26.9 million or 8% compared to 2017. The increase in net sales was primarily due to higher volumes of 4% and an increase in selling price and product mix of 4%. This reportable segment's operating earnings, excluding indirect expenses, were $88.3 million, an increase of $10.6 million or 14% compared to 2017. The increase in operating earnings year-over-year was the result of higher gross profit on the higher net sales noted above, coupled with an increase in gross margin due to changes in product mix and the impact of pricing initiatives which more than offset raw material cost increases. These increases to the segment's 2018 operating earnings were partially offset by higher SG&A, primarily due to higher labor costs associated with annual merit increases and improved segment performance.\nEMEA\nEMEA represented approximately 27% of the Company's consolidated net sales in 2018. The segment's net sales were $233.6 million, an increase of $7.4 million or 3% compared to 2017. The increase in net sales was primarily due to the positive impact of foreign currency translation of 4% and increases in selling price and product mix of 3%, partially offset by lower volumes of 4%. The year-over-year volume comparison was impacted by an atypically high sales pattern in EMEA during the first quarter of 2017, a decrease in volume associated with a specific piece of business which the Company stopped selling during the second half of 2018 primarily due to its limited profitability, and a slowing of orders at the end of 2018 due to market challenges in Europe. The foreign exchange impact was primarily due to a strengthening of the euro against the U.S. dollar as this exchange rate averaged 1.18 in 2018 compared to 1.13 in 2017. This reportable segment's operating earnings, excluding indirect expenses, were $36.0 million, an increase of $0.6 million or 2% compared to 2017. The increase in operating earnings year-over-year was the result of higher gross profit on the higher net sales noted above, coupled with an increase in gross margin due to changes in product mix and the impact of pricing initiatives which more than offset raw material cost increases. These increases to the segment's 2018 operating earnings were partially offset by higher SG&A, primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation as well as higher labor costs associated with annual merit increases.\nAsia/Pacific\nAsia/Pacific represented approximately 25% of the Company's consolidated net sales in 2018. The segment's net sales were $214.2 million, an increase of $13.1 million or 7% compared to 2017. The increase in net sales was primarily due to higher volumes of 8% partially offset by a decrease in selling price and product mix of 1%. This reportable segment's operating earnings, excluding indirect expenses, were $56.1 million, an increase of $7.7 million or 16% compared to 2017. The increase in operating earnings year-over-year was primarily driven by higher gross profit on the increase in net sales, noted above, coupled with an increase in gross margin due to changes in product mix and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in SG&A due to lower labor expenses.\nSouth America\nSouth America represented approximately 4% of the Company's consolidated net sales in 2018. The segment's net sales were $36.3 million, an increase of $0.1 million or less than 1% compared to 2017. The slight increase in net sales was primarily due to higher volumes of 8% and an increase in selling price and product mix of approximately 7%, offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation of 15%. The foreign exchange impact was primarily due to a weakening of both the Brazilian real and Argentinian peso against the U.S. dollar as these exchange rates averaged 3.63 and 26.13 in 2018 compared to 3.19 and 16.50 in 2017, respectively. This reportable segment's operating earnings, excluding indirect expenses, were $3.9 million in both 2018 and 2017. This flat year-over-year operating earnings in South America was the result of the slight increase in net sales, noted above, and lower SG&A largely due to foreign currency translation, partially offset by a lower gross margin on raw material changes and impacts due to foreign currency translation.\nReportable Operating Segment Review - Comparison of 2017 with 2016\nNorth America\nNorth America represented approximately 43% of the Company's consolidated net sales in 2017. The segment's net sales were $356.6 million, an increase of $20.4 million or 6% compared to 2016. The increase in net sales was primarily due to higher volumes of 3%, including acquisitions, and an increase in selling price and product mix of 3%. This reportable segment's operating earnings, excluding indirect expenses, were $77.7 million, a decrease of $0.1 million compared to 2016. North America's relatively consistent operating earnings were the net result of a decline in gross margin and higher levels of SG&A, which offset higher gross profit on the increase in net sales, noted above. The decline in gross margin was due to increases in certain raw material costs and changes in product mix. The higher SG&A was primarily due to increases in labor costs primarily associated with annual merit increases and additional SG&A associated with the Lubricor acquisition.\nEMEA\nEMEA represented approximately 28% of the Company's consolidated net sales in 2017. The segment's net sales were $226.2 million, an increase of $25.3 million or 13% compared to 2016. The increase in net sales was primarily due to higher volumes of 7%, an increase in selling price and product mix of 4% and the positive impact of foreign currency translation of 2%. Included in the 2017 volume increase was an atypically high sales pattern in the first quarter. The foreign exchange impact was primarily due to a strengthening of the euro against the U.S. dollar, as this exchange rate averaged approximately 1.13 in 2017 compared to approximately 1.10 in 2016. This reportable segment's operating earnings, excluding indirect expenses, were $35.4 million, an increase of $1.5 million or 5% compared to 2016. The increase in EMEA's operating earnings was driven by higher gross profit on the increase in net sales, noted above, partially offset by a lower gross margin due to increases in certain raw material costs and product mix and slightly higher SG&A year-over-year due to increases in labor costs primarily associated with annual merit increases and improved segment performance.\nAsia/Pacific\nAsia/Pacific represented approximately 25% of the Company's consolidated net sales in 2017. The segment's net sales were $201.0 million, an increase of $21.9 million or 12% compared to 2016. The increase in net sales was primarily due to higher volumes of 16% partially offset by a decrease in selling price and product mix of 4% and the negative impact of foreign currency translation of less than 1%. The foreign exchange impact was primarily due to a weakening of the Chinese renminbi against the U.S. dollar, which offset a strengthening of the Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar, year-over-year. These exchange rates averaged 6.75 and 65.1 in 2017 compared to 6.64 and 67.18 in 2016, respectively. This reportable segment's operating earnings, excluding indirect expenses, were $48.3 million, an increase of $2.5 million or 5% compared to 2016. The increase in Asia/Pacific's operating earnings was driven by higher gross profit on the increase in net sales, noted above, partially offset by a lower gross margin due to increases in certain raw material costs and product mix and slightly higher SG&A year-over-year due to increases in labor costs primarily associated with annual merit increases and improved segment performance.\nSouth America\nSouth America represented approximately 4% of the Company's consolidated net sales in 2017. The segment's net sales were $36.2 million, an increase of $5.8 million or 19% compared to 2016. The increase in net sales was primarily due to higher volumes of 6%, an increase in selling price and product mix of 7% and the positive impact of foreign currency translation of 6%. The foreign exchange impact was primarily due to a strengthening of the Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar, which offset a weakening of the Argentinian peso against the U.S. dollar, year-over-year. These exchange rates averaged 3.19 and 16.50 in 2017 compared 3.47 and 14.73 in 2016, respectively. This reportable segment's operating earnings, excluding indirect expenses, were $3.9 million, an increase of $2.5 million or 183% compared to 2016. The increase in South America's operating earnings was driven by higher gross profit on the increase in net sales, as well as a higher gross margin primarily due to pricing initiatives and lower raw material costs. These increases to operating earnings year-over-year were partially offset by slightly higher SG&A due to increases in labor costs primarily associated with annual merit increases and improved segment performance.\nEnvironmental Clean-up Activities\nThe Company is involved in environmental clean-up activities in connection with an existing plant location and former waste disposal sites. In 1992, the Company identified certain soil and groundwater contamination at AC Products, Inc. ( ACP\u201d), a wholly owned subsidiary. In voluntary coordination with the Santa Ana California Regional Water Quality Board, ACP has been remediating the contamination. In 2007, ACP agreed to operate two groundwater treatment systems, so as to hydraulically contain groundwater contamination emanating from ACP's site until such time as the concentrations of contaminants are below the current Federal maximum contaminant level for four consecutive quarterly sampling events. In 2014, ACP ceased operation at one of its two groundwater treatment systems, as it had met the above condition for closure. As of December 31, 2018, ACP believes it is close to meeting the conditions for closure of the remaining groundwater treatment system but continues to operate this system while in discussions with the relevant authorities and believes that the range of potential-known liabilities associated with the balance of ACP's water remediation program is approximately $0.1 million to $1.0 million. The low and high ends of the range are based on the length of operation of the treatment system as required by the conditions noted above, as determined by groundwater modeling. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company cannot be certain that future liabilities in the form of remediation expenses and damages will not be in excess of the high end of the range. See Note 25 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report.\nGeneral\nSee", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nExecutive Summary\nQuaker Chemical Corporation is a leading global provider of process fluids, chemical specialties, and technical expertise to a wide range of industries, including steel, aluminum, automotive, mining, aerospace, tube and pipe, cans, and others. For 100 years, Quaker has helped customers around the world achieve production efficiency, improve product quality, and lower costs through a combination of innovative technology, process knowledge, and customized services. Headquartered in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania USA, Quaker serves businesses worldwide with a network of dedicated and experienced professionals whose mission is to make a difference.\nThe Company delivered strong operating results in 2018 on solid net sales growth coupled with a higher gross margin year-over-year. Specifically, net sales increased 6% to $867.5 million in 2018 compared to $820.1 million in 2017 driven by volume growth of 3% and increases in selling price and product mix of 2%. This increase in net sales, coupled with a higher gross margin of 36.0% in 2018 compared to 35.5% in 2017, drove a 7% increase in the Company's gross profit year-over-year. The increase in the Company's current year gross margin was primarily driven by pricing initiatives and the mix of certain products sold which more than offset increases in raw material costs year-over-year. In addition, current year operating income as a percentage of sales benefited from the Company's continued discipline in managing its selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A\u201d).\nThe Company's 2018 net income and earnings per diluted share were $59.5 million and $4.45, respectively, compared to $20.3 million and $1.52 per diluted share, respectively, in 2017. During 2018, the Company incurred $19.5 million or $1.21 per diluted share of total costs associated with the Company's previously announced combination with Houghton International, Inc. ( Houghton\u201d) (herein referred to as the Combination\u201d), compared to $30.8 million or $1.90 per diluted share of total costs related to the Combination during 2017. The Company's 2018 and 2017 results were also impacted by the Company's initial fourth quarter of 2017 estimate of $22.2 million or $1.67 per diluted share and subsequent 2018 adjustments of $5.8 million or $0.43 per diluted share related to the 2017 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( U.S. Tax Reform\u201d). Excluding expenses related to the Combination, charges related to U.S Tax Reform and other non-core items in each period, the Company's strong current year operating performance coupled with a lower 2018 effective tax rate resulted in a 21% increase in its non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to $6.04 in 2018 compared to $5.01 in 2017. The Company's 2018 adjusted EBITDA was a record $125.6 million, an increase of 9% compared to $115.2 million in the prior year. These results were achieved despite a negative impact from foreign exchange on current year earnings of approximately $0.08 per diluted share, or 1%. See the Non-GAAP Measures section of this Item below, as well as other items discussed in the Company's Consolidated Operations Review in the Operations section of this Item, below.\nFrom a regional perspective, the Company's 2018 operating performance was highlighted by year-over-year operating earnings increases in its three largest regions. The Company's North America and Asia/Pacific regions had particularly strong operating earnings in 2018, increasing 14% and 16% year-over-year, respectively. North America's results were driven by net sales growth of 8% on higher volumes and selling price and product mix while Asia/Pacific had net sales growth of 7% primarily on higher volumes, with both regions also benefiting from higher gross margins year-over-year. The Company's Europe, Middle East and Africa ( EMEA\u201d) region benefited from the positive impact of foreign currency translation year-over-year and increases in selling price and product mix, as well as a higher gross margin in 2018 compared to 2017, which offset a decline in volume year-over-year primarily driven by an atypically high sales pattern in EMEA during the first quarter of 2017, a decrease in volume associated with a specific piece of business which the Company stopped selling during the middle of 2018 primarily due to its limited profitability, and a slowing of orders at the end of 2018 due to market challenges. The Company's smallest region, South America, had a relatively consistent level of operating earnings year-over-year as strong net sales growth from increases in volume and selling price and product mix as well as lower SG&A were offset by the significant negative impact of foreign currency translation. See the Reportable Operating Segments Review, in the Operations section of this Item, below.\nThe Company generated net operating cash flow of $78.8 million in 2018 compared to $64.8 million in 2017. The increase in net operating cash flow year-over-year was primarily due to the Company's solid current year operating performance. The key drivers of the Company's operating cash flow and overall liquidity are further discussed in the Company's Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this Item, below.\nOverall, the Company is pleased to have delivered another strong year. While operating conditions were mixed throughout all of its regions and foreign exchange became a headwind in the second half of 2018, the Company's continued market share gains drove solid volume and net sales growth that exceeded the Company's estimate of year-over-year growth in its end markets. In addition, the\nbenefit of current year pricing initiatives and the mix of products sold continued to outpace higher raw material costs and contributed to the Company's gross margin improvement compared to the prior year. These increases in the Company's operating performance coupled with a continued discipline in managing SG&A drove a 9% increase in adjusted EBITDA and, coupled with a lower effective tax rate, resulted in a 21% increase in non-GAAP earnings per diluted share compared to 2017.\nLooking forward to 2019, the Company estimates that it will receive final regulatory approval and close the Combination within the next few months. As previously disclosed, the Combination will approximately double the Company's annual sales and adjusted EBITDA, not including estimated synergies, which are expected to meet or exceed $45 million once fully achieved by the third year. Depending upon the exact timing of the Combination's close, the Company anticipates it will realize a portion of the Houghton sales and adjusted EBITDA in 2019.\nFor Quaker's current business, the Company expects some headwinds particularly in the early months of 2019, such as the impacts from a strong U.S. dollar and some base market challenges due to global economic uncertainty. However, the Company also expects continued market share gains to help offset these headwinds. Overall, the Company remains confident in its future given its modestly growing global end markets and continued market share gains and expects 2019 to be another good year for the current Quaker business.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nQuaker's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon Quaker's consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these financial statements requires Quaker to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, Quaker evaluates its estimates, including those related to customer sales incentives, product returns, bad debts, inventories, property, plant and equipment, investments, goodwill, intangible assets, income taxes, business combinations, restructuring, incentive compensation plans (including equity-based compensation), pensions and other postretirement benefits, contingencies and litigation. Quaker bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under such circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. However, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nQuaker believes the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements:\n1. Accounts receivable and inventory exposures - Quaker establishes allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of Quaker's customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. As part of its terms of trade, Quaker may custom manufacture products for certain large customers and/or may ship products on a consignment basis. Further, a significant portion of Quaker's revenues is derived from sales to customers in industries where companies have experienced past financial difficulties. If a customer bankruptcy occurs, then Quaker must judge the amount of proceeds, if any, that may ultimately be received through the bankruptcy or liquidation process. These matters may increase the Company's exposure, should a bankruptcy occur, and may require a write down or a disposal of certain inventory. Reserves for customers filing for bankruptcy protection are established based on a percentage of the amount outstanding at the bankruptcy filing date. However, initially establishing this reserve and the amount thereto is dependent on the Company's evaluation of likely proceeds to be received from the bankruptcy process, which could result in the Company recognizing minimal or no reserve at the date of bankruptcy. Large and/or financially distressed customers are generally reserved for on a specific review basis, while a general reserve is maintained for other customers based on historical experience. The Company's consolidated allowance for doubtful accounts was $5.2 million and $5.5 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company recorded expense to increase its provision for doubtful accounts by $0.5 million, $0.1 million and $1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Changing the amount of expense recorded to the Company's provisions by 10% would have increased or decreased the Company's pre-tax earnings by $0.1 million, less than $0.1 million and $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report.\n2. Environmental and litigation reserves - Accruals for environmental and litigation matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Accrued liabilities are exclusive of claims against third parties and are not discounted. Environmental costs and remediation costs are capitalized if the costs extend the life, increase the capacity or improve the safety or efficiency of the property from the date acquired or constructed, and/or mitigate or prevent contamination in the future. Estimates for accruals for environmental matters are based on a variety of potential technical solutions, governmental regulations and other factors, and are subject to a wide range of potential costs for remediation and other actions. A considerable amount of judgment is required in determining the most likely estimate within the range of total costs, and the factors determining this judgment may vary over time. Similarly, reserves for litigation and similar matters are based on a range of potential outcomes and require considerable judgment in determining the most probable outcome. If no amount within the range is considered more probable than any other amount, the Company accrues the lowest amount in that range in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. See Note 25 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report.\n3. Realizability of equity investments - Quaker holds equity investments in various foreign companies, where it has the ability to influence, but not control, the operations of the entity and its future results. Quaker would record an impairment charge to an investment if it believed a decline in value that was other than temporary occurred. Adverse changes in market conditions, poor operating results of underlying investments, devaluation of foreign currencies or other events or circumstances could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments, potentially leading to an impairment charge in the future. The carrying amount of the Company's equity investments as of December 31, 2018 was $21.3 million, which included three investments: $14.7 million for a 33% interest in Primex, Ltd. (Barbados); $6.2 million for a 50% interest in Nippon Quaker Chemical, Ltd. (Japan); and $0.4 million for a 50% interest in Kelko Quaker Chemical, S.A. (Panama), respectively. The Company also has a 50-50 joint venture in a Venezuelan affiliate, Kelko Quaker Chemical, S.A ( Kelko Venezuela\u201d). Due to heightened foreign exchange controls, current economic circumstances and other restrictions in Venezuela, during the third quarter of 2018 the Company concluded that it no longer had significant influence over this affiliate. Prior to this determination, the Company historically accounted for this affiliate under the equity method. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has no remaining carrying value for its investment in Kelko Venezuela. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report.\n4. Tax exposures, uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances - Quaker records expenses and liabilities for taxes based on estimates of amounts that will be determined as deductible in tax returns filed in various jurisdictions. The filed tax returns are subject to audit, which often occur several years subsequent to the date of the financial statements. Disputes or disagreements may arise during audits over the timing or validity of certain items or deductions, which may not be resolved for extended periods of time. Quaker also evaluates for uncertain tax positions on all income tax positions taken on previously filed tax returns or expected to be taken on a future tax return, which prescribes the recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return and, also, whether the benefits of tax positions are probable or if they will be more likely than not sustained upon audit based upon the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are determined to be more likely than not sustained upon audit, the Company would recognize the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement in the financial statements. For tax positions that are not determined to be more likely than not sustained upon audit, the Company would not recognize any portion of the benefit in its financial statements. In addition, the Company's continuing practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. Also, the Company would net its liability for unrecognized tax benefits against deferred tax assets related to net operating losses or other tax credit carryforwards if the uncertain tax position were settled for the presumed amount at the balance sheet date.\nQuaker also records valuation allowances when necessary to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While Quaker has considered future taxable income and employs prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, in the event Quaker were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should Quaker determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. Both determinations could have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as U.S. Tax Reform. Among other provisions, U.S. Tax Reform reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, implemented a new system of taxation for non-U.S. earnings which eliminates U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from certain foreign subsidiaries, and imposed a one-time tax on the deemed repatriation of undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries. The Securities and Exchange Commission issued guidance on accounting for the tax effects of U.S. Tax Reform and provided a one-year measurement period for companies to complete the accounting. Based on reasonable interpretations and assumptions with regard to various uncertainties and ambiguities in the application of certain provisions of U.S. Tax Reform and subsequent to numerous temporary regulations, notices, and other formal guidance published by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS\u201d), U.S. Treasury, and various state taxing authorities in 2018, the Company completed its accounting for the tax effects of U.S. Tax Reform as of December 22, 2018. It is possible that the IRS could issue subsequent guidance or take positions on audit that differ from the Company's interpretations and assumptions. The Company currently believes that subsequent guidance, or interpretations made by the IRS will not be materially different from the Company's application of the provisions of U.S. Tax Reform and would not have a material adverse effect on the Company's tax liabilities, earnings, or financial condition.\nPursuant to U.S. Tax Reform, specifically the one-time tax on deemed repatriation of foreign earnings, the Company has recorded a charge for U.S. income tax on its undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries; however, the Company could be subject to other taxes, such as withholding taxes and dividend distribution taxes if these undistributed earnings are ultimately remitted to the U.S. As a result of the impacts from U.S. Tax reform, the Company re-evaluated its global cash strategy, resulting in a change to its indefinite reinvestment assertion attributable to a portion of its undistributed foreign earnings, and recognized a deferred tax liability and corresponding deferred tax expense of $7.9 million as of December 31, 2018, which primarily represents the Company's estimate of the non-U.S. taxes the Company will incur to ultimately remit these earnings to the U.S. It is the Company's current intention to reinvest its additional undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries to support working capital needs and certain other growth initiatives. The amount of such undistributed earnings at December 31, 2018 was approximately $210.0 million. Any tax liability which might result from ultimate remittance of these earnings is expected to be substantially offset by foreign tax credits (subject to certain limitations). It is currently impractical to estimate any such incremental tax expense. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report.\n5. Goodwill and other intangible assets - The Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. This method requires the recording of acquired assets, including separately identifiable intangible assets, at their acquisition date fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. The determination of the estimated fair value of assets acquired requires management's judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, royalty rates, asset lives and market multiples, among other items. When necessary, the Company consults with external advisors to help determine fair value. For non-observable market values, the Company may determine fair value using acceptable valuation principles, including the excess earnings, relief from royalty, lost profit or cost methods.\nThe Company amortizes definite-lived intangible assets on a straight-line basis over their useful lives. Goodwill and intangible assets which have indefinite lives are not amortized and are required to be assessed at least annually for impairment. The Company compares the assets' fair value to their carrying value, primarily based on future discounted cash flows, in order to determine if an impairment charge is warranted. The estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance. Assumptions used in these forecasts are consistent with internal planning, but the actual cash flows could differ from management's estimates due to changes in business conditions, operating performance, and economic conditions. The Company's assumed weighted average cost of capital ( WACC\u201d) and estimated future net operating profit after tax ( NOPAT\u201d) by reporting unit are particularly important in determining estimated future cash flows.\nThe Company completed its annual impairment assessment during the fourth quarter of 2018, and no impairment charge was warranted. Furthermore, the estimated fair value of each of the Company's reporting units substantially exceeded its carrying value, with none of the Company's reporting units at risk for failing step one of the goodwill impairment test. The Company's consolidated goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were $84.4 million and $87.1 million, respectively. The Company used a WACC of approximately 9%, and at October 1, 2018, this assumption would have had to increase by more than 229% before any of the Company's reporting units would fail step one of the impairment analysis. Further, at October 1, 2018, the Company's estimate of future NOPAT by reporting unit would have had to decrease by more than 75% before any of the Company's reporting units would be considered potentially impaired. See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report.\n6. Postretirement benefits - The Company provides certain defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefits to current employees, former employees and retirees. Independent actuaries, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, perform the required valuations to determine benefit expense and, if necessary, non-cash charges to equity for additional minimum pension liabilities. Critical assumptions used in the actuarial valuation include the weighted average discount rate, including the use of a split discount rate (spot-rate approach) for the U.S. plans and certain foreign plans, rates of increase in compensation levels, and expected long-term rates of return on assets. If different assumptions were used, additional pension expense or charges to equity might be required.\nThe Company's primary noncontributory U.S. pension plan (the U.S. Pension Plan\u201d) has a November 30 year-end and a measurement date of December 31. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company began the process of terminating the U.S. Pension Plan after receiving Board of Director approval to do so. The Company expects to record a pension settlement charge at plan termination. This settlement charge will include the immediate recognition into expense of the unrecognized losses within accumulated other comprehensive loss ( AOCI\u201d) on the balance sheet as of the plan termination date. The Company does not have a current estimate for this future settlement charge, however, the gross AOCI related to this plan was approximately $19 million as of December 31, 2018. The Company currently estimates that the U.S. Pension Plan termination will be completed during 2020. See Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report.\nThe following table highlights the potential impact on the Company's pre-tax earnings due to changes in assumptions with respect to the Company's pension plans, based on assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2018:\nTable 19: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1/2 Percentage Point Increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1/2 Percentage Point Decrease\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in millions)\n</td> <td> Foreign\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> U.S.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Foreign\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> U.S.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Discount rate (1)\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.7)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected rate of return on plan assets (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.8)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) The weighted-average discount rate used to determine net periodic benefit costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 2.33% for Foreign plans and 3.44% for U.S. plans.\n(2) The weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets used to determine net periodic benefit costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 2.22% for Foreign plans and 5.95% for U.S. plans.\n7. Restructuring and other related liabilities - A restructuring related program may consist of charges for employee severance, rationalization of manufacturing facilities and other related expenses. To account for such, the Company applies the Financial Accounting Standards Board's guidance regarding exit or disposal cost obligations. This guidance requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred, is estimable, and payment is probable. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nSee Note 3 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report for a discussion regarding recently issued accounting standards.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt December 31, 2018, Quaker had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $124.4 million, including $20.3 million of restricted cash. Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was approximately $111.1 million at December 31, 2017, which included $21.2 million of restricted cash. The inclusion of restricted cash in total cash on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows is the result of a change in presentation required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The $13.4 million increase was the net result of $78.8 million of cash provided by operating activities offset by $12.4 million of cash used in investing activities, $46.9 million of cash used in financing activities and a $6.1 million negative impact due to the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $78.8 million in 2018 compared to $64.8 million in 2017. The $14.0 million increase was primarily due to increased cash generation as a result of the Company's strong year-over-year operating performance growth as well as a $4.1 million second quarter of 2018 cash dividend received from its equity investment, Primex, Ltd ( Primex\u201d), compared to no dividend received in the prior year. The Company's level of cash invested in working capital was higher in 2018 compared to 2017, including increased accounts receivables related to higher net sales year-over-year. Also, the Company recorded a significant collection of receivables from a certain customer late in the fourth quarter of 2017 which was uncommon and did not recur in 2018. In addition, the Company recorded higher cash outflows from inventory in 2018 as the Company re-stocked inventory levels throughout 2018 to a level sufficient to address increased customer demand compared to lower inventory levels held at the end of 2017. Operating cash flow related to current and non-current estimated taxes on income were impacted by additional tax payments related to U.S. Tax Reform during 2018. The Company's operating cash flows in 2018 and 2017 were also impacted by the timing and amount of combination-related expenses and associated cash payments, described below. Finally, 2017 included restructuring payments made as part of the Company's global restructuring program initiated in the fourth quarter of 2015 and completed during the first half of 2017, described below.\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased from $14.6 million in 2017 to $12.4 million in 2018, primarily due to lower payments for acquisitions in the current year. During 2017, the Company had cash outflows of $5.4 million for the acquisition of assets associated with a business that markets, sells and manufactures certain metalworking fluids, whereas during 2018, the Company paid $0.5 million for certain formulations and product technology in the mining industry. In accordance with the terms of that acquisition agreement, an additional $0.5 million of the purchase price was paid during the first quarter of 2019. In addition, the Company had higher cash proceeds from dispositions of assets during 2017 as compared to 2018, primarily as a result of $1.4 million of cash proceeds received during the fourth quarter of 2017 for the disposition of a held-for-sale asset compared to $0.6 million of cash proceeds received during the second quarter of 2018. These lower investing cash flows were partially offset by slightly higher additions to property, plant and equipment during 2018 as compared to 2017, primarily due to an increase in spending related to a new manufacturing facility in India that is expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2019.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $46.9 million in 2018 compared to $55.2 million in 2017. The $8.3 million decrease in cash outflows was primarily due to $31.8 million of cash used in the fourth quarter of 2017 to purchase the remaining noncontrolling interest in the Company's India affiliate. These impacts of lower 2018 cash outflows were partially offset by higher repayments of long-term debt year-over-year, with repayments of $26.8 million during 2018 compared to repayments of $2.9 million during 2017. Also, during 2018, one of the Company's less than 100% owned consolidated affiliates made a distribution to the noncontrolling affiliate shareholder of $0.9 million. There were no similar distributions during 2017. In addition, the Company paid $19.3 million in cash dividends during 2018, a $0.7 million increase in cash dividends compared to the prior year.\nThe Company's primary credit facility ( the Credit Facility\u201d) is a $300.0 million syndicated multicurrency credit agreement with a group of lenders. The maximum amount available under the Credit Facility can be increased to $400.0 million at the Company's option if the lenders agree and the Company satisfies certain conditions. Borrowings under the Credit Facility generally bear interest at a base rate or LIBOR rate plus a margin. The Credit Facility has certain financial and other covenants, with the key financial covenant requiring that the Company's consolidated total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio cannot exceed 3.50 to 1. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company's consolidated total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was below 1.0 to 1, and the Company was also in compliance with all of its other covenants. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Credit Facility was amended and restated to extend the maturity date to March 15, 2020. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had total credit facility borrowings of $24.0 million and $48.5 million, respectively, primarily under the Credit Facility. The Company's other debt obligations as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were primarily industrial development bonds, including a $5.0 million industrial development bond which matured and was paid off during the fourth quarter of 2018, and municipality-related loans.\nQuaker's management approved a global restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of 2015 (the 2015 Program\u201d) to reduce its operating costs. The Company completed all of the initiatives under the 2015 Program during the first half of 2017. The Company did not incur related costs in 2018 and does not expect to incur any further restructuring charges under this program. During 2017, the company incurred $0.7 million of cash payments utilizing operating cash flows for the settlement of these restructuring liabilities.\nOn April 4, 2017, Quaker entered into a share purchase agreement with Gulf Houghton Lubricants, Ltd. to purchase the entire issued and outstanding share capital of Houghton. The shares will be bought for aggregate purchase consideration consisting of: (i) $172.5 million in cash; (ii) a number of shares of common stock, $1.00 par value per share, of the Company comprising 24.5% of the common stock outstanding upon the closing of the Combination; and (iii) the Company's assumption of Houghton's net indebtedness as of the closing of the Combination, which was approximately $690 million at signing. See Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn connection with the Combination, the Company secured $1.15 billion in commitments from Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank to fund the purchase consideration and provide additional liquidity, and has since replaced these commitments with a syndicated bank agreement ( the New Credit Facility\u201d) with a group of lenders for $1.15 billion. The New Credit Facility is contingent upon and will not be effective until the closing of the Combination. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company extended the bank commitment through March 15, 2019. The New Credit Facility is comprised of a $400.0 million multicurrency revolver, a $600.0 million USD term loan and a $150.0 million EUR equivalent term loan, each with a five-year term from the date the New Credit Facility becomes effective. The maximum amount available under the New Credit Facility can be increased by $200.0 million at the Company's option if the lenders agree and the Company satisfies certain conditions. Borrowings under the New Credit Facility will bear interest at a base rate, LIBOR rate plus a margin or Euribor rate plus a margin, and the Company currently estimates the annual floating rate cost will be in the 3.75% to 4.0% range based on current market interest rates. The New Credit Facility will be subject to certain financial and other covenants, including covenants that the Company's consolidated net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio cannot exceed 4.25 to 1 and the Company's consolidated adjusted EBITDA to interest expense ratio cannot be less than 3.0 to 1. Both the USD and EUR equivalent term loans will have quarterly principal amortization during their respective five-year terms, with 5.0% amortization of the principal balance due in years 1 and 2, 7.5% in year 3, and 10.0% in years 4 and 5, with the remaining principal amounts due at maturity. Until closing, the Company will incur certain interest costs paid to maintain the bank commitment ( ticking fees\u201d), which began to accrue on September 29, 2017. The ticking fees bear an interest rate of 0.30% per annum.\nThe Company incurred $19.5 million of total combination-related expenses during 2018, which includes approximately $3.5 million of ticking fees as well as a $0.6 million gain on the sale of a held-for-sale asset, described in the Non-GAAP measures section of this Item below. The Company had net cash outflows related to these costs of approximately $16.8 million during 2018. Comparatively, during 2017, combination-related expenses totaled $30.8 million, including $0.9 million of ticking fees, with cash outflows related to these costs of approximately $25.9 million. The Company currently estimates it will incur additional costs and have associated cash outflows of approximately $25 to $30 million through closing of the Combination for similar combination-related expenses, including cash payments for bank fees which we expect to capitalize. In addition, post-closing of the combination, the Company expects it will incur additional costs and make associated cash payments to integrate the Company and Houghton and to begin realizing the Combination's total anticipated cost synergies, which we currently estimate to meet or exceed $45 million. The timing and an accurate range of these additional costs and cash payments post-closing are not estimable at this time. However, based on market precedents, the Company currently projects these costs to approximate one times anticipated synergies, and the Company expects them to be incurred over a three-year period post-close.\nThe Company received regulatory approval for the Combination from China and Australia in 2017. In addition, at a shareholder meeting held during 2017, the Company's shareholders overwhelmingly approved the issuance of the new shares of the Company's common stock at closing of the Combination. The European Commission ( EC\u201d) conditionally approved the Combination in December 2018. Quaker expects final approval from the EC once the final purchase agreement is in place between Quaker, Houghton, and the buyer of the divested product lines. Quaker continues to be in productive discussions with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission ( FTC\u201d), although the process is taking longer than anticipated. Given the time lapse since Quaker's initial filing, the FTC requested updated information as part of their approval process late in the fourth quarter of 2018. In addition, the government shutdown in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2019 extended the timeline to receive the final approval. The proposed remedy being discussed with the FTC continues to be consistent with Quaker's previous guidance that the total divested product lines will be approximately 3% of the combined company's revenue. Given current information, the Company estimates that FTC and EC final approval and closing of the combination will occur within the next few months. Given these contingencies and the overall timing of the Combination, the Company has not recorded any estimated costs for additional expenses that the Company expects, but had yet to incur as of December 31, 2018, related to the Combination.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company's gross liability for uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, was $8.5 million. The Company cannot determine a reliable estimate of the timing of cash flows by period related to its uncertain tax position liability. However, should the entire liability be paid, the amount of the payment may be reduced by up to $4.9 million as a result of offsetting benefits in other tax jurisdictions. Related to the impact of U.S. Tax Reform, as of December 31, 2018, the Company's remaining gross deemed repatriation transition tax ( Transition Tax\u201d) on previously untaxed accumulated and current earnings and profits of certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries is $8.9 million. The Company elected to pay the U.S. federal Transition Tax over 8 years, as allowed, $7.6 million of which is considered a long-term tax payable due after 2019 with the remainder due during 2019, as presented in the contractual obligations table, below.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company began the process of terminating the U.S. Pension Plan after receiving the Company's Board of Director approval to do so. Participants of the U.S. Pension Plan will have their benefits either converted into a lump sum cash payment or an annuity contract placed with an insurance carrier. The U.S. Pension Plan is fully-funded on a U.S. GAAP basis. In order to terminate the plan in accordance with IRS and pension benefit guaranty corporation requirements, the Company will be required to fully fund the plan on a termination basis and will commit to contribute the additional assets necessary, if any, to do so. The amount necessary to do so is not yet known but is currently estimated to be between $0 and $10 million. The Company currently estimates that the U.S. Pension Plan termination will be completed during 2020. See Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report.\nThe Company believes it is capable of supporting its operating requirements and funding its business objectives, including but not limited to, payments of dividends to shareholders, costs related to the Combination, pension plan contributions, capital expenditures, other business opportunities and other potential contingencies, through internally generated funds supplemented with debt or equity as needed.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flows in future periods. Pension and other postretirement plan contributions beyond 2019 are not determinable since the amount of any contribution is heavily dependent on the future economic environment and investment returns on pension trust assets. The timing of payments related to other long-term liabilities which consists primarily of deferred compensation agreements, also cannot be readily determined due to their uncertainty. Interest obligations on the Company's long-term debt and capital leases assume the current debt levels will be outstanding for the entire respective period and apply the interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2018.\nTable 20: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2024 and\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Beyond\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36,694\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,714\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,407\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,279\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,635\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,779\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transition Tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,439\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pension and other postretirement plan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> contributions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,675\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,675\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other long-term liabilities (See Note 21 of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,510\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,510\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 96,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,145\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,592\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,811\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 29,414\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-GAAP Measures\nIncluded in this Form 10-K filing are two non-GAAP (unaudited) financial measures: non-GAAP earnings per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information as they enhance a reader's understanding of the financial performance of the Company, are more indicative of future operating performance of the Company, and facilitate a better comparison among fiscal periods, as the non-GAAP financial measures exclude items that are not considered core to the Company's operations. Non-GAAP results are presented for supplemental informational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP.

The Company holds a 33% investment in and has significant influence over Primex, and therefore accounts for this interest under the equity method of accounting. The income attributable to Primex is not indicative of the future operating performance of the Company and is not considered core to the Company's operations. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report.\n(b) Restructuring credit represents the credit recorded by the Company as part of finalizing a global restructuring program which was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2015. This credit is not indicative of the future operating performance of the Company. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report.\n(c) Houghton combination-related expenses include certain legal, environmental, financial, and other advisory and consultant costs incurred in connection with the strategic evaluation of, diligence on, and execution of the definitive agreement to combine with Houghton, as well as regulatory and shareholder approvals and integration planning associated with the pending Combination. These costs are not indicative of the future operating performance of the Company. Certain of these costs were considered non-deductible for the purpose of determining the Company's effective tax rate and, therefore, the earnings per diluted share amount reflects this impact. Also, included in the caption Houghton combination-related expenses for 2018 is a $0.6 million gain on the sale of a held-for-sale asset recorded in Other expense, net, in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. In addition, during 2018, the Company incurred approximately $3.5 million of ticking fees to maintain the bank commitment related to the pending Combination. Comparatively, the Company began incurring ticking fees as of September 29, 2017 and recognized $0.9 million during 2017. These interest costs are included in the caption Houghton combination-related expenses in the reconciliation of GAAP earnings per diluted share attributable to Quaker Chemical Corporation common shareholders to Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share above but are included in the caption Interest expense in the reconciliation of Net income attributable to Quaker Chemical Corporation to Adjusted EBITDA above. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report.\n(d) U.S. Tax Reform charges, net, represent the tax expense incurred by the Company related to its initial 2017 estimates and subsequent 2018 adjustments to adopt U.S. Tax Reform. The 2017 tax expense includes the Company's estimated impact of the Transition Tax, net of eliminating U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from certain foreign subsidiaries in 2017, as well as the impact of revaluing certain of the Company's U.S. deferred tax balances from 35% to the new 21% U.S. corporate tax rate. The 2018 tax expense includes certain adjustments recorded by the Company as a result of changes to the Company's initial fourth quarter of 2017 estimates. Specifically, the Company has adjusted the initial amount estimated for the one-time charge on the gross deemed repatriation Transition Tax on previously untaxed accumulated and current earnings and profits of certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries, as well as updated its assertion related to permanent reinvestment of accumulated earning and profits of certain of these foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the Company has adjusted its initial estimate of the impact from certain internal revenue code changes associated with the deductibility of certain executive compensation. All of these adjustments were based on guidance issued during 2018 and 2017 by the IRS, the U.S. Treasury and various state taxing authorities and were the result of specific one-time events that are not indicative of future operating performance of the Company. U.S. Tax Reform charges, net, are included within Taxes on income before equity in net income of associated companies in the reconciliation of Net income attributable to Quaker Chemical Corporation to Adjusted EBITDA. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report.\n(e) U.S. pension plan settlement charge represents the expense recorded for the settlement of one of the Company's U.S. pension plans vested terminated participants. This settlement charge represents the immediate recognition into expense of a portion of the unrecognized loss within AOCI on the balance sheet in proportion to the share of the projected benefit obligation that was settled by these payments. This charge was the result of a specific one-time event and is not indicative of the future operating performance of the Company. See Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report.\n(f) Cost streamlining initiative represents expenses associated with certain actions taken to reorganize the Company's corporate staff. Overall, these costs are non-core and are indirect operating expenses that are not attributable to the product sales of any respective reportable operating segment, and, therefore, are not indicative of the future operating performance of the Company.\n(g) Loss on disposal of held-for-sale asset represents a one-time charge to write down the value of a held-for-sale asset at the Company's India affiliate to its fair value. This charge was the result of a specific one-time event and is not indicative of the future operating performance of the Company. See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report.\n(h) Insurance insolvency recovery represents income associated with cash receipts from an insolvent insurance carrier for previously submitted claims by an inactive subsidiary of the Company. This other income is not indicative of the future operating performance of the Company. See Notes 8 and 25 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report.\n(i) Gain on liquidation of an inactive legal entity represents the decrease in historical cumulative currency translation adjustments associated with an inactive legal entity which was closed during the third quarter of 2018. These cumulative currency translation adjustments were the result of remeasuring the legal entity's monetary assets and liabilities to the applicable published exchange rates and were a component of AOCI, which was included in total shareholder's equity on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. As required under U.S. GAAP, when a legal entity is liquidated, any amount attributable to that legal entity and accumulated in the currency translation adjustment component of equity is required to be removed from equity and reported as part of the gain or loss on liquidation of the legal entity during the period in which the liquidation occurs. This recognized gain is not indicative of the future operating performance of the Company. See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report.\n(j) Currency conversion impacts of hyper-inflationary economies represents the foreign currency remeasurement impacts associated with the Company's Venezuelan and Argentina affiliates whose local economies are designated as hyper-inflationary under U.S. GAAP. An entity which operates within an economy deemed to be hyper-inflationary under U.S. GAAP is required to remeasure its monetary assets and liabilities to the applicable published exchange rates and record the associated gains or losses resulting from the remeasurement directly to the Consolidated Statements of Income. Venezuela's economy has been considered hyper-inflationary under U.S. GAAP since 2010 while Argentina's economy has been considered hyper-inflationary beginning July 1, 2018. The charges incurred related to the immediate recognition of foreign currency remeasurement in the Consolidated Statements of Income associated with these entities are not indicative of the future operating performance of the Company. See Notes 8 and 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appear in Item 8 of this Report.\n(k) Within the Company's calculation of Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share above, each reconciling item includes the impact of any current and deferred income tax expense (benefit) as applicable. The income tax expense (benefit) related to these items was determined utilizing the applicable rates in the taxing jurisdictions in which these adjustments occurred.\n(l) The Company calculates Adjusted EBITDA margin as the percentage of Adjusted EBITDA to consolidated net sales.\nOperations\nConsolidated Operations Review - Comparison of 2018 with 2017\nNet sales grew $47.4 million or 6% in 2018, increasing to $867.5 million compared to $820.1 million in 2017. The Company's 2018 net sales benefited from increases in volume of 3%, selling price and product mix of 2%, as well as a positive impact from foreign currency translation of less than 1% or $3.7 million.\nCost of goods sold ( COGS\u201d) in 2018 of $555.2 million increased 5% from $528.6 million in 2017. The increase in COGS was primarily due to the increase in product volumes, noted above, the impact of certain raw material cost increases, changes in product mix and the negative impact of foreign currency translation year-over-year.\nGross profit in 2018 increased $20.8 million or 7% compared to 2017, primarily driven by the increase in net sales and product volumes, noted above, as well as a higher gross margin of 36.0% in 2018 compared to 35.5% in 2017. The increase in the Company's gross margin in 2018 was primarily driven by pricing initiatives and the mix of certain products sold which more than offset increases in raw material costs.\nSG&A in 2018 increased $9.1 million compared to 2017 due to higher labor-related costs, primarily from annual merit increases and incentive-based compensation due to the Company's strong operating performance, as well as the negative impact from foreign currency translation. These increases year-over-year were partially offset by a first quarter of 2017 cost streamlining initiative described in the Non-GAAP measures section of this Item, above.\nDuring 2018, the Company incurred $16.7 million of costs related to its previously announced pending Combination with Houghton, described in the Non-GAAP measures section of this Item, above. Comparatively, the Company incurred $29.9 million of similar combination-related expenses in 2017 as well as certain due diligence-related costs.\nOperating income in 2018 was $87.8 million compared to $62.7 million in 2017. The increase in operating income was due to strong net sales and gross profit increases as well as lower Houghton combination-related expenses, noted above, partially offset by an increase in SG&A not related to the pending Houghton combination.\nThe Company had other expense, net, of $0.6 million in 2018 compared to $0.7 million in 2017. The decrease in other expense, net, includes both a $1.9 million settlement charge in one of the Company's U.S. pension plans and a $0.1 million loss on the disposal of a held for sale asset in 2017, as well as a 2018 gain of $0.6 million on the sale of a held-for-sale asset. The positive year-over-year impact of these items was partially offset by $0.5 million lower year-over-year cash proceeds received from an insolvent insurance carrier with respect to previously filed recovery claims by an inactive subsidiary of the Company. In addition to all of these items, which are described in the Non-GAAP measures section of this Item, above, the Company also had foreign currency transaction losses in 2018 compared to foreign currency transaction gains in 2017. The Company's 2018 foreign currency transaction losses included both recurring transactional activity as well as foreign currency transaction losses of approximately $0.4 million related to the Company's Argentina subsidiary and a foreign currency transaction gain of approximately $0.4 million related to the liquidation of an inactive legal entity, both of which are described in the Non-GAAP measures section of this Item, above. Lastly, the Company had a decrease in receipts of local municipality-related grants in one of the Company's regions year-over-year.\nInterest expense increased $2.3 million year-over-year, primarily due to higher 2018 costs incurred to maintain the bank commitment for the pending Houghton Combination, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense due to lower average outstanding borrowings on the Company's existing credit facility during 2018 compared to 2017. Interest income was $0.4 million lower in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to changes in the level of the Company's invested cash in certain regions with higher returns as well as a decrease in interest received on certain tax-related credits year-over-year.\nThe Company's effective tax rates for 2018 and 2017 were 30.1% and 68.7%, respectively. The Company's elevated 2018 and 2017 effective tax rates were impacted by its initial estimate and subsequent adjustments related to U.S. Tax Reform, as well as certain non-deductible Houghton combination-related expenses in both years, described in the Non-GAAP measures section of this Item, above. Excluding these items in each period, the Company estimates that its 2018 and 2017 effective tax rates would have been approximately 22% and 27%, respectively. The decrease in the Company's effective tax rate year-over-year was primarily due to a shift in earnings to lower tax jurisdictions and a lower U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% in 2018 compared to 35% in 2017. The Company has experienced and expects to continue to experience volatility in its effective tax rates due to several factors, including the timing of tax audits and the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations as they relate to uncertain tax positions, the unpredictability of the timing and amount of certain incentives in various tax jurisdictions, the treatment of certain acquisition-related costs and the timing and amount of certain share-based compensation-related tax benefits, among other factors.\nEquity in net income of associated companies ( equity income\u201d) decreased $1.5 million in 2018 compared to 2017. The decrease was primarily due to lower earnings from the Company's interest in a captive insurance company in 2018, partially offset by higher currency conversion charges in 2017 related to the Company's hyper-inflationary Venezuelan affiliate, both described in the Non-GAAP measures section of this Item, above.\nThe Company had a $1.7 million decrease in net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to the Company's purchase of the remaining interest in its India joint venture during December 2017.\nForeign exchange negatively impacted the Company's 2018 earnings by approximately 1% or $0.08 per diluted share, driven by the negative impact of net foreign currency transaction losses year-over-year, noted above, partially offset by a positive impact from foreign currency translation.\nConsolidated Operations Review - Comparison of 2017 with 2016\nNet sales in 2017 of $820.1 million increased 10% compared to net sales of $746.7 million in 2016. The $73.4 million increase in net sales was the result of a 6% increase in organic volumes, a 1% or $10.7 million increase from sales attributable to the Company's 2016 acquisition of Lubricor Inc. and its affiliate entities ( Lubricor\u201d), a 2% increase due to changes in selling price and product mix and the positive impact of foreign currency translation of $4.9 million or 1%.\nCOGS in 2017 of $528.6 million increased 13% from $466.6 million in 2016. The increase in COGS was primarily due to the increase in product volumes, noted above, as well as additional COGS attributed to the Company's 2016 acquisition of Lubricor, the impact of certain raw material cost increases, changes in product mix and the negative impact of foreign currency translation year-over-year.\nGross profit in 2017 increased $11.4 million or 4% compared to 2016, primarily driven by the increase in sales volumes, noted above, partially offset by a lower gross margin of 35.5% in 2017 compared to 37.5% in 2016. The decrease in the Company's gross margin in 2017 was primarily due to higher raw material costs compared to 2016 and a change in the mix of certain products sold.\nSG&A in 2017 increased $5.1 million compared to 2016 primarily due to additional SG&A associated with the Company's 2016 Lubricor acquisition, an increase due to the impact of foreign currency translation, higher labor-related costs primarily due to annual compensation increases and incentive compensation, as well as a first quarter of 2017 cost streamlining initiative, described in the Non-GAAP measures section of this Item, above. These increases to SG&A were partially offset by decreases as a result of certain cost savings efforts, including the impact of the 2015 global restructuring program in 2017.\nThe Company substantially completed the 2015 global restructuring program during 2016 and recognized a restructuring credit of $0.4 million during the fourth quarter of 2016 to update its initial estimates for employee separation costs. There were no comparable restructuring costs or credits during 2017.\nDuring 2017, the Company incurred $29.9 million of costs related to its previously announced Combination with Houghton, described in the Non-GAAP measures section of this Item, above. The Company incurred $1.5 million of similar combination-related expenses in 2016.\nOperating income in 2017 was $62.7 million compared to $85.4 million in 2016. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to the higher Houghton combination-related expenses along with slightly higher levels of SG&A not related to the Houghton Combination, which more than offset gross profit increases on strong volume growth, noted above.\nThe Company had other expense, net, of $0.7 million in 2017 compared to $0.5 million in 2016. The increase in other expense, net, was primarily driven by a second quarter of 2017 U.S. pension plan settlement charge and a fourth quarter of 2017 loss on the disposal of a held-for-sale asset, partially offset by income associated with an insurance insolvency recovery in the fourth quarter of 2017, all of which are described in the Non-GAAP measures section of this Item, above. In addition, the Company had higher foreign currency transaction gains realized in 2017 compared to 2016 and an increase in receipts of local municipality-related grants in one of the Company's regions year-over-year.\nInterest expense increased $1.0 million year-over-year, primarily due to costs incurred to maintain the committed capital for the pending Houghton Combination. Interest income increased $0.5 million in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to an increase in the level of the Company's invested cash in certain regions with higher returns.\nThe Company's effective tax rates for 2017 and 2016 were 68.7% and 27.6%, respectively. The primary drivers of the increase in the Company's effective tax rate during 2017 were the impact of certain non-deductible Houghton combination-related expenses as well as $22.2 million of charges related to U.S. Tax Reform, described in the Non-GAAP measures section of this Item, above. The Company estimates that its 2017 effective tax rate would have been approximately 27%, without the impact of U.S. Tax Reform and non-deductible Houghton combination-related expenses. These increases to the 2017 effective tax rate were partially offset by the favorable impact of tax benefits for deductions in excess of compensation cost associated with stock option exercises and restricted stock vesting in 2017. In 2016, there were minimal non-deductible Houghton combination-related expenses, no charges similar to those of the 2017 U.S. Tax Reform and no comparable share-based compensation-related tax benefits. Also, in both 2017 and 2016, the Company's mix of foreign earnings in jurisdictions with lower effective tax rates impacted each year's tax expense.\nEquity income increased $1.0 million in 2017 compared to 2016. The increase in equity income was primarily due to higher earnings from the Company's interest in a captive insurance company in 2017. In addition, the Company recorded hyper-inflationary accounting currency conversion charges in both 2017 and 2016, respectively, associated with the Company's Venezuela affiliate. The Company's interest in a captive insurance company and the currency conversion charges recorded are described in the Non-GAAP measures section of this Item, above.\nThe Company had a $0.4 million increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to an increase in performance from certain consolidated affiliates in the Company's Asia/Pacific region partially offset by the impact of the Company's purchase of the remaining interest in its India joint venture in December 2017.\nForeign exchange in total had minimal impact on the Company's 2017 earnings, as a negative impact from foreign currency translation of less than 1% or $0.01 per diluted share and the Venezuela hyper-inflationary currency conversion charges, noted above, were offset by the positive impact of higher foreign currency transaction gains year-over-year.\nReportable Operating Segment Review - Comparison of 2018 with 2017\nThe Company sells its industrial process fluids, chemical specialties and technical expertise to a wide range of industries in a global product portfolio throughout its four segments: (i) North America, (ii) EMEA, (iii) Asia/Pacific and (iv) South America.\nNorth America\nNorth America represented approximately 44% of the Company's consolidated net sales in 2018. The segment's net sales were $383.5 million, an increase of $26.9 million or 8% compared to 2017. The increase in net sales was primarily due to higher volumes of 4% and an increase in selling price and product mix of 4%. This reportable segment's operating earnings, excluding indirect expenses, were $88.3 million, an increase of $10.6 million or 14% compared to 2017. The increase in operating earnings year-over-year was the result of higher gross profit on the higher net sales noted above, coupled with an increase in gross margin due to changes in product mix and the impact of pricing initiatives which more than offset raw material cost increases. These increases to the segment's 2018 operating earnings were partially offset by higher SG&A, primarily due to higher labor costs associated with annual merit increases and improved segment performance.\nEMEA\nEMEA represented approximately 27% of the Company's consolidated net sales in 2018. The segment's net sales were $233.6 million, an increase of $7.4 million or 3% compared to 2017. The increase in net sales was primarily due to the positive impact of foreign currency translation of 4% and increases in selling price and product mix of 3%, partially offset by lower volumes of 4%. The year-over-year volume comparison was impacted by an atypically high sales pattern in EMEA during the first quarter of 2017, a decrease in volume associated with a specific piece of business which the Company stopped selling during the second half of 2018 primarily due to its limited profitability, and a slowing of orders at the end of 2018 due to market challenges in Europe. The foreign exchange impact was primarily due to a strengthening of the euro against the U.S. dollar as this exchange rate averaged 1.18 in 2018 compared to 1.13 in 2017. This reportable segment's operating earnings, excluding indirect expenses, were $36.0 million, an increase of $0.6 million or 2% compared to 2017. The increase in operating earnings year-over-year was the result of higher gross profit on the higher net sales noted above, coupled with an increase in gross margin due to changes in product mix and the impact of pricing initiatives which more than offset raw material cost increases. These increases to the segment's 2018 operating earnings were partially offset by higher SG&A, primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation as well as higher labor costs associated with annual merit increases.\nAsia/Pacific\nAsia/Pacific represented approximately 25% of the Company's consolidated net sales in 2018. The segment's net sales were $214.2 million, an increase of $13.1 million or 7% compared to 2017. The increase in net sales was primarily due to higher volumes of 8% partially offset by a decrease in selling price and product mix of 1%. This reportable segment's operating earnings, excluding indirect expenses, were $56.1 million, an increase of $7.7 million or 16% compared to 2017. The increase in operating earnings year-over-year was primarily driven by higher gross profit on the increase in net sales, noted above, coupled with an increase in gross margin due to changes in product mix and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in SG&A due to lower labor expenses.\nSouth America\nSouth America represented approximately 4% of the Company's consolidated net sales in 2018. The segment's net sales were $36.3 million, an increase of $0.1 million or less than 1% compared to 2017. The slight increase in net sales was primarily due to higher volumes of 8% and an increase in selling price and product mix of approximately 7%, offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation of 15%. The foreign exchange impact was primarily due to a weakening of both the Brazilian real and Argentinian peso against the U.S. dollar as these exchange rates averaged 3.63 and 26.13 in 2018 compared to 3.19 and 16.50 in 2017, respectively. This reportable segment's operating earnings, excluding indirect expenses, were $3.9 million in both 2018 and 2017. This flat year-over-year operating earnings in South America was the result of the slight increase in net sales, noted above, and lower SG&A largely due to foreign currency translation, partially offset by a lower gross margin on raw material changes and impacts due to foreign currency translation.\nReportable Operating Segment Review - Comparison of 2017 with 2016\nNorth America\nNorth America represented approximately 43% of the Company's consolidated net sales in 2017. The segment's net sales were $356.6 million, an increase of $20.4 million or 6% compared to 2016. The increase in net sales was primarily due to higher volumes of 3%, including acquisitions, and an increase in selling price and product mix of 3%. This reportable segment's operating earnings, excluding indirect expenses, were $77.7 million, a decrease of $0.1 million compared to 2016. North America's relatively consistent operating earnings were the net result of a decline in gross margin and higher levels of SG&A, which offset higher gross profit on the increase in net sales, noted above. The decline in gross margin was due to increases in certain raw material costs and changes in product mix. The higher SG&A was primarily due to increases in labor costs primarily associated with annual merit increases and additional SG&A associated with the Lubricor acquisition.\nEMEA\nEMEA represented approximately 28% of the Company's consolidated net sales in 2017. The segment's net sales were $226.2 million, an increase of $25.3 million or 13% compared to 2016. The increase in net sales was primarily due to higher volumes of 7%, an increase in selling price and product mix of 4% and the positive impact of foreign currency translation of 2%. Included in the 2017 volume increase was an atypically high sales pattern in the first quarter. The foreign exchange impact was primarily due to a strengthening of the euro against the U.S. dollar, as this exchange rate averaged approximately 1.13 in 2017 compared to approximately 1.10 in 2016. This reportable segment's operating earnings, excluding indirect expenses, were $35.4 million, an increase of $1.5 million or 5% compared to 2016. The increase in EMEA's operating earnings was driven by higher gross profit on the increase in net sales, noted above, partially offset by a lower gross margin due to increases in certain raw material costs and product mix and slightly higher SG&A year-over-year due to increases in labor costs primarily associated with annual merit increases and improved segment performance.\nAsia/Pacific\nAsia/Pacific represented approximately 25% of the Company's consolidated net sales in 2017. The segment's net sales were $201.0 million, an increase of $21.9 million or 12% compared to 2016. The increase in net sales was primarily due to higher volumes of 16% partially offset by a decrease in selling price and product mix of 4% and the negative impact of foreign currency translation of less than 1%. The foreign exchange impact was primarily due to a weakening of the Chinese renminbi against the U.S. dollar, which offset a strengthening of the Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar, year-over-year. These exchange rates averaged 6.75 and 65.1 in 2017 compared to 6.64 and 67.18 in 2016, respectively. This reportable segment's operating earnings, excluding indirect expenses, were $48.3 million, an increase of $2.5 million or 5% compared to 2016. The increase in Asia/Pacific's operating earnings was driven by higher gross profit on the increase in net sales, noted above, partially offset by a lower gross margin due to increases in certain raw material costs and product mix and slightly higher SG&A year-over-year due to increases in labor costs primarily associated with annual merit increases and improved segment performance.\nSouth America\nSouth America represented approximately 4% of the Company's consolidated net sales in 2017. The segment's net sales were $36.2 million, an increase of $5.8 million or 19% compared to 2016. The increase in net sales was primarily due to higher volumes of 6%, an increase in selling price and product mix of 7% and the positive impact of foreign currency translation of 6%. The foreign exchange impact was primarily due to a strengthening of the Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar, which offset a weakening of the Argentinian peso against the U.S. dollar, year-over-year. These exchange rates averaged 3.19 and 16.50 in 2017 compared 3.47 and 14.73 in 2016, respectively. This reportable segment's operating earnings, excluding indirect expenses, were $3.9 million, an increase of $2.5 million or 183% compared to 2016. The increase in South America's operating earnings was driven by higher gross profit on the increase in net sales, as well as a higher gross margin primarily due to pricing initiatives and lower raw material costs. These increases to operating earnings year-over-year were partially offset by slightly higher SG&A due to increases in labor costs primarily associated with annual merit increases and improved segment performance.\nEnvironmental Clean-up Activities\nThe Company is involved in environmental clean-up activities in connection with an existing plant location and former waste disposal sites. In 1992, the Company identified certain soil and groundwater contamination at AC Products, Inc. ( ACP\u201d), a wholly owned subsidiary. In voluntary coordination with the Santa Ana California Regional Water Quality Board, ACP has been remediating the contamination. In 2007, ACP agreed to operate two groundwater treatment systems, so as to hydraulically contain groundwater contamination emanating from ACP's site until such time as the concentrations of contaminants are below the current Federal maximum contaminant level for four consecutive quarterly sampling events. In 2014, ACP ceased operation at one of its two groundwater treatment systems, as it had met the above condition for closure. As of December 31, 2018, ACP believes it is close to meeting the conditions for closure of the remaining groundwater treatment system but continues to operate this system while in discussions with the relevant authorities and believes that the range of potential-known liabilities associated with the balance of ACP's water remediation program is approximately $0.1 million to $1.0 million. The low and high ends of the range are based on the length of operation of the treatment system as required by the conditions noted above, as determined by groundwater modeling. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company cannot be certain that future liabilities in the form of remediation expenses and damages will not be in excess of the high end of the range. See Note 25 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report.\nGeneral\nSee", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nExecutive Summary\nQuaker Chemical Corporation is a leading global provider of process fluids, chemical specialties, and technical expertise to a wide range of industries, including steel, aluminum, automotive, mining, aerospace, tube and pipe, cans, and others. For 100 years, Quaker has helped customers around the world achieve production efficiency, improve product quality, and lower costs through a combination of innovative technology, process knowledge, and customized services. Headquartered in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania USA, Quaker serves businesses worldwide with a network of dedicated and experienced professionals whose mission is to make a difference.\nThe Company delivered strong operating results in 2018 on solid net sales growth coupled with a higher gross margin year-over-year. Specifically, net sales increased 6% to $867.5 million in 2018 compared to $820.1 million in 2017 driven by volume growth of 3% and increases in selling price and product mix of 2%. This increase in net sales, coupled with a higher gross margin of 36.0% in 2018 compared to 35.5% in 2017, drove a 7% increase in the Company's gross profit year-over-year. The increase in the Company's current year gross margin was primarily driven by pricing initiatives and the mix of certain products sold which more than offset increases in raw material costs year-over-year. In addition, current year operating income as a percentage of sales benefited from the Company's continued discipline in managing its selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A\u201d).\nThe Company's 2018 net income and earnings per diluted share were $59.5 million and $4.45, respectively, compared to $20.3 million and $1.52 per diluted share, respectively, in 2017. During 2018, the Company incurred $19.5 million or $1.21 per diluted share of total costs associated with the Company's previously announced combination with Houghton International, Inc. ( Houghton\u201d) (herein referred to as the Combination\u201d), compared to $30.8 million or $1.90 per diluted share of total costs related to the Combination during 2017. The Company's 2018 and 2017 results were also impacted by the Company's initial fourth quarter of 2017 estimate of $22.2 million or $1.67 per diluted share and subsequent 2018 adjustments of $5.8 million or $0.43 per diluted share related to the 2017 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( U.S. Tax Reform\u201d). Excluding expenses related to the Combination, charges related to U.S Tax Reform and other non-core items in each period, the Company's strong current year operating performance coupled with a lower 2018 effective tax rate resulted in a 21% increase in its non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to $6.04 in 2018 compared to $5.01 in 2017. The Company's 2018 adjusted EBITDA was a record $125.6 million, an increase of 9% compared to $115.2 million in the prior year. These results were achieved despite a negative impact from foreign exchange on current year earnings of approximately $0.08 per diluted share, or 1%. See the Non-GAAP Measures section of this Item below, as well as other items discussed in the Company's Consolidated Operations Review in the Operations section of this Item, below.\nFrom a regional perspective, the Company's 2018 operating performance was highlighted by year-over-year operating earnings increases in its three largest regions. The Company's North America and Asia/Pacific regions had particularly strong operating earnings in 2018, increasing 14% and 16% year-over-year, respectively. North America's results were driven by net sales growth of 8% on higher volumes and selling price and product mix while Asia/Pacific had net sales growth of 7% primarily on higher volumes, with both regions also benefiting from higher gross margins year-over-year. The Company's Europe, Middle East and Africa ( EMEA\u201d) region benefited from the positive impact of foreign currency translation year-over-year and increases in selling price and product mix, as well as a higher gross margin in 2018 compared to 2017, which offset a decline in volume year-over-year primarily driven by an atypically high sales pattern in EMEA during the first quarter of 2017, a decrease in volume associated with a specific piece of business which the Company stopped selling during the middle of 2018 primarily due to its limited profitability, and a slowing of orders at the end of 2018 due to market challenges. The Company's smallest region, South America, had a relatively consistent level of operating earnings year-over-year as strong net sales growth from increases in volume and selling price and product mix as well as lower SG&A were offset by the significant negative impact of foreign currency translation. See the Reportable Operating Segments Review, in the Operations section of this Item, below.\nThe Company generated net operating cash flow of $78.8 million in 2018 compared to $64.8 million in 2017. The increase in net operating cash flow year-over-year was primarily due to the Company's solid current year operating performance. The key drivers of the Company's operating cash flow and overall liquidity are further discussed in the Company's Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this Item, below.\nOverall, the Company is pleased to have delivered another strong year. While operating conditions were mixed throughout all of its regions and foreign exchange became a headwind in the second half of 2018, the Company's continued market share gains drove solid volume and net sales growth that exceeded the Company's estimate of year-over-year growth in its end markets. In addition, the\nbenefit of current year pricing initiatives and the mix of products sold continued to outpace higher raw material costs and contributed to the Company's gross margin improvement compared to the prior year. These increases in the Company's operating performance coupled with a continued discipline in managing SG&A drove a 9% increase in adjusted EBITDA and, coupled with a lower effective tax rate, resulted in a 21% increase in non-GAAP earnings per diluted share compared to 2017.\nLooking forward to 2019, the Company estimates that it will receive final regulatory approval and close the Combination within the next few months. As previously disclosed, the Combination will approximately double the Company's annual sales and adjusted EBITDA, not including estimated synergies, which are expected to meet or exceed $45 million once fully achieved by the third year. Depending upon the exact timing of the Combination's close, the Company anticipates it will realize a portion of the Houghton sales and adjusted EBITDA in 2019.\nFor Quaker's current business, the Company expects some headwinds particularly in the early months of 2019, such as the impacts from a strong U.S. dollar and some base market challenges due to global economic uncertainty. However, the Company also expects continued market share gains to help offset these headwinds. Overall, the Company remains confident in its future given its modestly growing global end markets and continued market share gains and expects 2019 to be another good year for the current Quaker business.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nQuaker's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon Quaker's consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these financial statements requires Quaker to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, Quaker evaluates its estimates, including those related to customer sales incentives, product returns, bad debts, inventories, property, plant and equipment, investments, goodwill, intangible assets, income taxes, business combinations, restructuring, incentive compensation plans (including equity-based compensation), pensions and other postretirement benefits, contingencies and litigation. Quaker bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under such circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. However, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nQuaker believes the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements:\n1. Accounts receivable and inventory exposures - Quaker establishes allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of Quaker's customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. As part of its terms of trade, Quaker may custom manufacture products for certain large customers and/or may ship products on a consignment basis. Further, a significant portion of Quaker's revenues is derived from sales to customers in industries where companies have experienced past financial difficulties. If a customer bankruptcy occurs, then Quaker must judge the amount of proceeds, if any, that may ultimately be received through the bankruptcy or liquidation process. These matters may increase the Company's exposure, should a bankruptcy occur, and may require a write down or a disposal of certain inventory. Reserves for customers filing for bankruptcy protection are established based on a percentage of the amount outstanding at the bankruptcy filing date. However, initially establishing this reserve and the amount thereto is dependent on the Company's evaluation of likely proceeds to be received from the bankruptcy process, which could result in the Company recognizing minimal or no reserve at the date of bankruptcy. Large and/or financially distressed customers are generally reserved for on a specific review basis, while a general reserve is maintained for other customers based on historical experience. The Company's consolidated allowance for doubtful accounts was $5.2 million and $5.5 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company recorded expense to increase its provision for doubtful accounts by $0.5 million, $0.1 million and $1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Changing the amount of expense recorded to the Company's provisions by 10% would have increased or decreased the Company's pre-tax earnings by $0.1 million, less than $0.1 million and $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report.\n2. Environmental and litigation reserves - Accruals for environmental and litigation matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Accrued liabilities are exclusive of claims against third parties and are not discounted. Environmental costs and remediation costs are capitalized if the costs extend the life, increase the capacity or improve the safety or efficiency of the property from the date acquired or constructed, and/or mitigate or prevent contamination in the future. Estimates for accruals for environmental matters are based on a variety of potential technical solutions, governmental regulations and other factors, and are subject to a wide range of potential costs for remediation and other actions. A considerable amount of judgment is required in determining the most likely estimate within the range of total costs, and the factors determining this judgment may vary over time. Similarly, reserves for litigation and similar matters are based on a range of potential outcomes and require considerable judgment in determining the most probable outcome. If no amount within the range is considered more probable than any other amount, the Company accrues the lowest amount in that range in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. See Note 25 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report.\n3. Realizability of equity investments - Quaker holds equity investments in various foreign companies, where it has the ability to influence, but not control, the operations of the entity and its future results. Quaker would record an impairment charge to an investment if it believed a decline in value that was other than temporary occurred. Adverse changes in market conditions, poor operating results of underlying investments, devaluation of foreign currencies or other events or circumstances could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments, potentially leading to an impairment charge in the future. The carrying amount of the Company's equity investments as of December 31, 2018 was $21.3 million, which included three investments: $14.7 million for a 33% interest in Primex, Ltd. (Barbados); $6.2 million for a 50% interest in Nippon Quaker Chemical, Ltd. (Japan); and $0.4 million for a 50% interest in Kelko Quaker Chemical, S.A. (Panama), respectively. The Company also has a 50-50 joint venture in a Venezuelan affiliate, Kelko Quaker Chemical, S.A ( Kelko Venezuela\u201d). Due to heightened foreign exchange controls, current economic circumstances and other restrictions in Venezuela, during the third quarter of 2018 the Company concluded that it no longer had significant influence over this affiliate. Prior to this determination, the Company historically accounted for this affiliate under the equity method. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has no remaining carrying value for its investment in Kelko Venezuela. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report.\n4. Tax exposures, uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances - Quaker records expenses and liabilities for taxes based on estimates of amounts that will be determined as deductible in tax returns filed in various jurisdictions. The filed tax returns are subject to audit, which often occur several years subsequent to the date of the financial statements. Disputes or disagreements may arise during audits over the timing or validity of certain items or deductions, which may not be resolved for extended periods of time. Quaker also evaluates for uncertain tax positions on all income tax positions taken on previously filed tax returns or expected to be taken on a future tax return, which prescribes the recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return and, also, whether the benefits of tax positions are probable or if they will be more likely than not sustained upon audit based upon the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are determined to be more likely than not sustained upon audit, the Company would recognize the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement in the financial statements. For tax positions that are not determined to be more likely than not sustained upon audit, the Company would not recognize any portion of the benefit in its financial statements. In addition, the Company's continuing practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. Also, the Company would net its liability for unrecognized tax benefits against deferred tax assets related to net operating losses or other tax credit carryforwards if the uncertain tax position were settled for the presumed amount at the balance sheet date.\nQuaker also records valuation allowances when necessary to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While Quaker has considered future taxable income and employs prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, in the event Quaker were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should Quaker determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. Both determinations could have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as U.S. Tax Reform. Among other provisions, U.S. Tax Reform reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, implemented a new system of taxation for non-U.S. earnings which eliminates U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from certain foreign subsidiaries, and imposed a one-time tax on the deemed repatriation of undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries. The Securities and Exchange Commission issued guidance on accounting for the tax effects of U.S. Tax Reform and provided a one-year measurement period for companies to complete the accounting. Based on reasonable interpretations and assumptions with regard to various uncertainties and ambiguities in the application of certain provisions of U.S. Tax Reform and subsequent to numerous temporary regulations, notices, and other formal guidance published by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS\u201d), U.S. Treasury, and various state taxing authorities in 2018, the Company completed its accounting for the tax effects of U.S. Tax Reform as of December 22, 2018. It is possible that the IRS could issue subsequent guidance or take positions on audit that differ from the Company's interpretations and assumptions. The Company currently believes that subsequent guidance, or interpretations made by the IRS will not be materially different from the Company's application of the provisions of U.S. Tax Reform and would not have a material adverse effect on the Company's tax liabilities, earnings, or financial condition.\nPursuant to U.S. Tax Reform, specifically the one-time tax on deemed repatriation of foreign earnings, the Company has recorded a charge for U.S. income tax on its undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries; however, the Company could be subject to other taxes, such as withholding taxes and dividend distribution taxes if these undistributed earnings are ultimately remitted to the U.S. As a result of the impacts from U.S. Tax reform, the Company re-evaluated its global cash strategy, resulting in a change to its indefinite reinvestment assertion attributable to a portion of its undistributed foreign earnings, and recognized a deferred tax liability and corresponding deferred tax expense of $7.9 million as of December 31, 2018, which primarily represents the Company's estimate of the non-U.S. taxes the Company will incur to ultimately remit these earnings to the U.S. It is the Company's current intention to reinvest its additional undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries to support working capital needs and certain other growth initiatives. The amount of such undistributed earnings at December 31, 2018 was approximately $210.0 million. Any tax liability which might result from ultimate remittance of these earnings is expected to be substantially offset by foreign tax credits (subject to certain limitations). It is currently impractical to estimate any such incremental tax expense. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report.\n5. Goodwill and other intangible assets - The Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. This method requires the recording of acquired assets, including separately identifiable intangible assets, at their acquisition date fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. The determination of the estimated fair value of assets acquired requires management's judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, royalty rates, asset lives and market multiples, among other items. When necessary, the Company consults with external advisors to help determine fair value. For non-observable market values, the Company may determine fair value using acceptable valuation principles, including the excess earnings, relief from royalty, lost profit or cost methods.\nThe Company amortizes definite-lived intangible assets on a straight-line basis over their useful lives. Goodwill and intangible assets which have indefinite lives are not amortized and are required to be assessed at least annually for impairment. The Company compares the assets' fair value to their carrying value, primarily based on future discounted cash flows, in order to determine if an impairment charge is warranted. The estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance. Assumptions used in these forecasts are consistent with internal planning, but the actual cash flows could differ from management's estimates due to changes in business conditions, operating performance, and economic conditions. The Company's assumed weighted average cost of capital ( WACC\u201d) and estimated future net operating profit after tax ( NOPAT\u201d) by reporting unit are particularly important in determining estimated future cash flows.\nThe Company completed its annual impairment assessment during the fourth quarter of 2018, and no impairment charge was warranted. Furthermore, the estimated fair value of each of the Company's reporting units substantially exceeded its carrying value, with none of the Company's reporting units at risk for failing step one of the goodwill impairment test. The Company's consolidated goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were $84.4 million and $87.1 million, respectively. The Company used a WACC of approximately 9%, and at October 1, 2018, this assumption would have had to increase by more than 229% before any of the Company's reporting units would fail step one of the impairment analysis. Further, at October 1, 2018, the Company's estimate of future NOPAT by reporting unit would have had to decrease by more than 75% before any of the Company's reporting units would be considered potentially impaired. See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report.\n6. Postretirement benefits - The Company provides certain defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefits to current employees, former employees and retirees. Independent actuaries, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, perform the required valuations to determine benefit expense and, if necessary, non-cash charges to equity for additional minimum pension liabilities. Critical assumptions used in the actuarial valuation include the weighted average discount rate, including the use of a split discount rate (spot-rate approach) for the U.S. plans and certain foreign plans, rates of increase in compensation levels, and expected long-term rates of return on assets. If different assumptions were used, additional pension expense or charges to equity might be required.\nThe Company's primary noncontributory U.S. pension plan (the U.S. Pension Plan\u201d) has a November 30 year-end and a measurement date of December 31. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company began the process of terminating the U.S. Pension Plan after receiving Board of Director approval to do so. The Company expects to record a pension settlement charge at plan termination. This settlement charge will include the immediate recognition into expense of the unrecognized losses within accumulated other comprehensive loss ( AOCI\u201d) on the balance sheet as of the plan termination date. The Company does not have a current estimate for this future settlement charge, however, the gross AOCI related to this plan was approximately $19 million as of December 31, 2018. The Company currently estimates that the U.S. Pension Plan termination will be completed during 2020. See Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report.\nThe following table highlights the potential impact on the Company's pre-tax earnings due to changes in assumptions with respect to the Company's pension plans, based on assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2018:\n\n(1) The weighted-average discount rate used to determine net periodic benefit costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 2.33% for Foreign plans and 3.44% for U.S. plans.\n(2) The weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets used to determine net periodic benefit costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 2.22% for Foreign plans and 5.95% for U.S. plans.\n7. Restructuring and other related liabilities - A restructuring related program may consist of charges for employee severance, rationalization of manufacturing facilities and other related expenses. To account for such, the Company applies the Financial Accounting Standards Board's guidance regarding exit or disposal cost obligations. This guidance requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred, is estimable, and payment is probable. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nSee Note 3 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report for a discussion regarding recently issued accounting standards.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt December 31, 2018, Quaker had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $124.4 million, including $20.3 million of restricted cash. Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was approximately $111.1 million at December 31, 2017, which included $21.2 million of restricted cash. The inclusion of restricted cash in total cash on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows is the result of a change in presentation required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The $13.4 million increase was the net result of $78.8 million of cash provided by operating activities offset by $12.4 million of cash used in investing activities, $46.9 million of cash used in financing activities and a $6.1 million negative impact due to the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $78.8 million in 2018 compared to $64.8 million in 2017. The $14.0 million increase was primarily due to increased cash generation as a result of the Company's strong year-over-year operating performance growth as well as a $4.1 million second quarter of 2018 cash dividend received from its equity investment, Primex, Ltd ( Primex\u201d), compared to no dividend received in the prior year. The Company's level of cash invested in working capital was higher in 2018 compared to 2017, including increased accounts receivables related to higher net sales year-over-year. Also, the Company recorded a significant collection of receivables from a certain customer late in the fourth quarter of 2017 which was uncommon and did not recur in 2018. In addition, the Company recorded higher cash outflows from inventory in 2018 as the Company re-stocked inventory levels throughout 2018 to a level sufficient to address increased customer demand compared to lower inventory levels held at the end of 2017. Operating cash flow related to current and non-current estimated taxes on income were impacted by additional tax payments related to U.S. Tax Reform during 2018. The Company's operating cash flows in 2018 and 2017 were also impacted by the timing and amount of combination-related expenses and associated cash payments, described below. Finally, 2017 included restructuring payments made as part of the Company's global restructuring program initiated in the fourth quarter of 2015 and completed during the first half of 2017, described below.\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased from $14.6 million in 2017 to $12.4 million in 2018, primarily due to lower payments for acquisitions in the current year. During 2017, the Company had cash outflows of $5.4 million for the acquisition of assets associated with a business that markets, sells and manufactures certain metalworking fluids, whereas during 2018, the Company paid $0.5 million for certain formulations and product technology in the mining industry. In accordance with the terms of that acquisition agreement, an additional $0.5 million of the purchase price was paid during the first quarter of 2019. In addition, the Company had higher cash proceeds from dispositions of assets during 2017 as compared to 2018, primarily as a result of $1.4 million of cash proceeds received during the fourth quarter of 2017 for the disposition of a held-for-sale asset compared to $0.6 million of cash proceeds received during the second quarter of 2018. These lower investing cash flows were partially offset by slightly higher additions to property, plant and equipment during 2018 as compared to 2017, primarily due to an increase in spending related to a new manufacturing facility in India that is expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2019.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $46.9 million in 2018 compared to $55.2 million in 2017. The $8.3 million decrease in cash outflows was primarily due to $31.8 million of cash used in the fourth quarter of 2017 to purchase the remaining noncontrolling interest in the Company's India affiliate. These impacts of lower 2018 cash outflows were partially offset by higher repayments of long-term debt year-over-year, with repayments of $26.8 million during 2018 compared to repayments of $2.9 million during 2017. Also, during 2018, one of the Company's less than 100% owned consolidated affiliates made a distribution to the noncontrolling affiliate shareholder of $0.9 million. There were no similar distributions during 2017. In addition, the Company paid $19.3 million in cash dividends during 2018, a $0.7 million increase in cash dividends compared to the prior year.\nThe Company's primary credit facility ( the Credit Facility\u201d) is a $300.0 million syndicated multicurrency credit agreement with a group of lenders. The maximum amount available under the Credit Facility can be increased to $400.0 million at the Company's option if the lenders agree and the Company satisfies certain conditions. Borrowings under the Credit Facility generally bear interest at a base rate or LIBOR rate plus a margin. The Credit Facility has certain financial and other covenants, with the key financial covenant requiring that the Company's consolidated total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio cannot exceed 3.50 to 1. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company's consolidated total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was below 1.0 to 1, and the Company was also in compliance with all of its other covenants. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Credit Facility was amended and restated to extend the maturity date to March 15, 2020. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had total credit facility borrowings of $24.0 million and $48.5 million, respectively, primarily under the Credit Facility. The Company's other debt obligations as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were primarily industrial development bonds, including a $5.0 million industrial development bond which matured and was paid off during the fourth quarter of 2018, and municipality-related loans.\nQuaker's management approved a global restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of 2015 (the 2015 Program\u201d) to reduce its operating costs. The Company completed all of the initiatives under the 2015 Program during the first half of 2017. The Company did not incur related costs in 2018 and does not expect to incur any further restructuring charges under this program. During 2017, the company incurred $0.7 million of cash payments utilizing operating cash flows for the settlement of these restructuring liabilities.\nOn April 4, 2017, Quaker entered into a share purchase agreement with Gulf Houghton Lubricants, Ltd. to purchase the entire issued and outstanding share capital of Houghton. The shares will be bought for aggregate purchase consideration consisting of: (i) $172.5 million in cash; (ii) a number of shares of common stock, $1.00 par value per share, of the Company comprising 24.5% of the common stock outstanding upon the closing of the Combination; and (iii) the Company's assumption of Houghton's net indebtedness as of the closing of the Combination, which was approximately $690 million at signing. See Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn connection with the Combination, the Company secured $1.15 billion in commitments from Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank to fund the purchase consideration and provide additional liquidity, and has since replaced these commitments with a syndicated bank agreement ( the New Credit Facility\u201d) with a group of lenders for $1.15 billion. The New Credit Facility is contingent upon and will not be effective until the closing of the Combination. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company extended the bank commitment through March 15, 2019. The New Credit Facility is comprised of a $400.0 million multicurrency revolver, a $600.0 million USD term loan and a $150.0 million EUR equivalent term loan, each with a five-year term from the date the New Credit Facility becomes effective. The maximum amount available under the New Credit Facility can be increased by $200.0 million at the Company's option if the lenders agree and the Company satisfies certain conditions. Borrowings under the New Credit Facility will bear interest at a base rate, LIBOR rate plus a margin or Euribor rate plus a margin, and the Company currently estimates the annual floating rate cost will be in the 3.75% to 4.0% range based on current market interest rates. The New Credit Facility will be subject to certain financial and other covenants, including covenants that the Company's consolidated net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio cannot exceed 4.25 to 1 and the Company's consolidated adjusted EBITDA to interest expense ratio cannot be less than 3.0 to 1. Both the USD and EUR equivalent term loans will have quarterly principal amortization during their respective five-year terms, with 5.0% amortization of the principal balance due in years 1 and 2, 7.5% in year 3, and 10.0% in years 4 and 5, with the remaining principal amounts due at maturity. Until closing, the Company will incur certain interest costs paid to maintain the bank commitment ( ticking fees\u201d), which began to accrue on September 29, 2017. The ticking fees bear an interest rate of 0.30% per annum.\nThe Company incurred $19.5 million of total combination-related expenses during 2018, which includes approximately $3.5 million of ticking fees as well as a $0.6 million gain on the sale of a held-for-sale asset, described in the Non-GAAP measures section of this Item below. The Company had net cash outflows related to these costs of approximately $16.8 million during 2018. Comparatively, during 2017, combination-related expenses totaled $30.8 million, including $0.9 million of ticking fees, with cash outflows related to these costs of approximately $25.9 million. The Company currently estimates it will incur additional costs and have associated cash outflows of approximately $25 to $30 million through closing of the Combination for similar combination-related expenses, including cash payments for bank fees which we expect to capitalize. In addition, post-closing of the combination, the Company expects it will incur additional costs and make associated cash payments to integrate the Company and Houghton and to begin realizing the Combination's total anticipated cost synergies, which we currently estimate to meet or exceed $45 million. The timing and an accurate range of these additional costs and cash payments post-closing are not estimable at this time. However, based on market precedents, the Company currently projects these costs to approximate one times anticipated synergies, and the Company expects them to be incurred over a three-year period post-close.\nThe Company received regulatory approval for the Combination from China and Australia in 2017. In addition, at a shareholder meeting held during 2017, the Company's shareholders overwhelmingly approved the issuance of the new shares of the Company's common stock at closing of the Combination. The European Commission ( EC\u201d) conditionally approved the Combination in December 2018. Quaker expects final approval from the EC once the final purchase agreement is in place between Quaker, Houghton, and the buyer of the divested product lines. Quaker continues to be in productive discussions with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission ( FTC\u201d), although the process is taking longer than anticipated. Given the time lapse since Quaker's initial filing, the FTC requested updated information as part of their approval process late in the fourth quarter of 2018. In addition, the government shutdown in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2019 extended the timeline to receive the final approval. The proposed remedy being discussed with the FTC continues to be consistent with Quaker's previous guidance that the total divested product lines will be approximately 3% of the combined company's revenue. Given current information, the Company estimates that FTC and EC final approval and closing of the combination will occur within the next few months. Given these contingencies and the overall timing of the Combination, the Company has not recorded any estimated costs for additional expenses that the Company expects, but had yet to incur as of December 31, 2018, related to the Combination.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company's gross liability for uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, was $8.5 million. The Company cannot determine a reliable estimate of the timing of cash flows by period related to its uncertain tax position liability. However, should the entire liability be paid, the amount of the payment may be reduced by up to $4.9 million as a result of offsetting benefits in other tax jurisdictions. Related to the impact of U.S. Tax Reform, as of December 31, 2018, the Company's remaining gross deemed repatriation transition tax ( Transition Tax\u201d) on previously untaxed accumulated and current earnings and profits of certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries is $8.9 million. The Company elected to pay the U.S. federal Transition Tax over 8 years, as allowed, $7.6 million of which is considered a long-term tax payable due after 2019 with the remainder due during 2019, as presented in the contractual obligations table, below.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company began the process of terminating the U.S. Pension Plan after receiving the Company's Board of Director approval to do so. Participants of the U.S. Pension Plan will have their benefits either converted into a lump sum cash payment or an annuity contract placed with an insurance carrier. The U.S. Pension Plan is fully-funded on a U.S. GAAP basis. In order to terminate the plan in accordance with IRS and pension benefit guaranty corporation requirements, the Company will be required to fully fund the plan on a termination basis and will commit to contribute the additional assets necessary, if any, to do so. The amount necessary to do so is not yet known but is currently estimated to be between $0 and $10 million. The Company currently estimates that the U.S. Pension Plan termination will be completed during 2020. See Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report.\nThe Company believes it is capable of supporting its operating requirements and funding its business objectives, including but not limited to, payments of dividends to shareholders, costs related to the Combination, pension plan contributions, capital expenditures, other business opportunities and other potential contingencies, through internally generated funds supplemented with debt or equity as needed.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flows in future periods. Pension and other postretirement plan contributions beyond 2019 are not determinable since the amount of any contribution is heavily dependent on the future economic environment and investment returns on pension trust assets. The timing of payments related to other long-term liabilities which consists primarily of deferred compensation agreements, also cannot be readily determined due to their uncertainty. Interest obligations on the Company's long-term debt and capital leases assume the current debt levels will be outstanding for the entire respective period and apply the interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2018.\n\nNon-GAAP Measures\nIncluded in this Form 10-K filing are two non-GAAP (unaudited) financial measures: non-GAAP earnings per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information as they enhance a reader's understanding of the financial performance of the Company, are more indicative of future operating performance of the Company, and facilitate a better comparison among fiscal periods, as the non-GAAP financial measures exclude items that are not considered core to the Company's operations. Non-GAAP results are presented for supplemental informational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. The following tables reconcile non-GAAP earnings per diluted share (unaudited) and adjusted EBITDA (unaudited) to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures:\n\n\n(a) Equity income in a captive insurance company represents the after-tax income attributable to the Company's interest in Primex, a captive insurance company. The Company holds a 33% investment in and has significant influence over Primex, and therefore accounts for this interest under the equity method of accounting. The income attributable to Primex is not indicative of the future operating performance of the Company and is not considered core to the Company's operations. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report.\n(b) Restructuring credit represents the credit recorded by the Company as part of finalizing a global restructuring program which was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2015. This credit is not indicative of the future operating performance of the Company. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report.\n(c) Houghton combination-related expenses include certain legal, environmental, financial, and other advisory and consultant costs incurred in connection with the strategic evaluation of, diligence on, and execution of the definitive agreement to combine with Houghton, as well as regulatory and shareholder approvals and integration planning associated with the pending Combination. These costs are not indicative of the future operating performance of the Company. Certain of these costs were considered non-deductible for the purpose of determining the Company's effective tax rate and, therefore, the earnings per diluted share amount reflects this impact. Also, included in the caption Houghton combination-related expenses for 2018 is a $0.6 million gain on the sale of a held-for-sale asset recorded in Other expense, net, in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. In addition, during 2018, the Company incurred approximately $3.5 million of ticking fees to maintain the bank commitment related to the pending Combination. Comparatively, the Company began incurring ticking fees as of September 29, 2017 and recognized $0.9 million during 2017. These interest costs are included in the caption Houghton combination-related expenses in the reconciliation of GAAP earnings per diluted share attributable to Quaker Chemical Corporation common shareholders to Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share above but are included in the caption Interest expense in the reconciliation of Net income attributable to Quaker Chemical Corporation to Adjusted EBITDA above. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report.\n(d) U.S. Tax Reform charges, net, represent the tax expense incurred by the Company related to its initial 2017 estimates and subsequent 2018 adjustments to adopt U.S. Tax Reform. The 2017 tax expense includes the Company's estimated impact of the Transition Tax, net of eliminating U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from certain foreign subsidiaries in 2017, as well as the impact of revaluing certain of the Company's U.S. deferred tax balances from 35% to the new 21% U.S. corporate tax rate. The 2018 tax expense includes certain adjustments recorded by the Company as a result of changes to the Company's initial fourth quarter of 2017 estimates. Specifically, the Company has adjusted the initial amount estimated for the one-time charge on the gross deemed repatriation Transition Tax on previously untaxed accumulated and current earnings and profits of certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries, as well as updated its assertion related to permanent reinvestment of accumulated earning and profits of certain of these foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the Company has adjusted its initial estimate of the impact from certain internal revenue code changes associated with the deductibility of certain executive compensation. All of these adjustments were based on guidance issued during 2018 and 2017 by the IRS, the U.S. Treasury and various state taxing authorities and were the result of specific one-time events that are not indicative of future operating performance of the Company. U.S. Tax Reform charges, net, are included within Taxes on income before equity in net income of associated companies in the reconciliation of Net income attributable to Quaker Chemical Corporation to Adjusted EBITDA. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report.\n(e) U.S. pension plan settlement charge represents the expense recorded for the settlement of one of the Company's U.S. pension plans vested terminated participants. This settlement charge represents the immediate recognition into expense of a portion of the unrecognized loss within AOCI on the balance sheet in proportion to the share of the projected benefit obligation that was settled by these payments. This charge was the result of a specific one-time event and is not indicative of the future operating performance of the Company. See Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report.\n(f) Cost streamlining initiative represents expenses associated with certain actions taken to reorganize the Company's corporate staff. Overall, these costs are non-core and are indirect operating expenses that are not attributable to the product sales of any respective reportable operating segment, and, therefore, are not indicative of the future operating performance of the Company.\n(g) Loss on disposal of held-for-sale asset represents a one-time charge to write down the value of a held-for-sale asset at the Company's India affiliate to its fair value. This charge was the result of a specific one-time event and is not indicative of the future operating performance of the Company. See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report.\n(h) Insurance insolvency recovery represents income associated with cash receipts from an insolvent insurance carrier for previously submitted claims by an inactive subsidiary of the Company. This other income is not indicative of the future operating performance of the Company. See Notes 8 and 25 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report.\n(i) Gain on liquidation of an inactive legal entity represents the decrease in historical cumulative currency translation adjustments associated with an inactive legal entity which was closed during the third quarter of 2018. These cumulative currency translation adjustments were the result of remeasuring the legal entity's monetary assets and liabilities to the applicable published exchange rates and were a component of AOCI, which was included in total shareholder's equity on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. As required under U.S. GAAP, when a legal entity is liquidated, any amount attributable to that legal entity and accumulated in the currency translation adjustment component of equity is required to be removed from equity and reported as part of the gain or loss on liquidation of the legal entity during the period in which the liquidation occurs. This recognized gain is not indicative of the future operating performance of the Company. See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report.\n(j) Currency conversion impacts of hyper-inflationary economies represents the foreign currency remeasurement impacts associated with the Company's Venezuelan and Argentina affiliates whose local economies are designated as hyper-inflationary under U.S. GAAP. An entity which operates within an economy deemed to be hyper-inflationary under U.S. GAAP is required to remeasure its monetary assets and liabilities to the applicable published exchange rates and record the associated gains or losses resulting from the remeasurement directly to the Consolidated Statements of Income. Venezuela's economy has been considered hyper-inflationary under U.S. GAAP since 2010 while Argentina's economy has been considered hyper-inflationary beginning July 1, 2018. The charges incurred related to the immediate recognition of foreign currency remeasurement in the Consolidated Statements of Income associated with these entities are not indicative of the future operating performance of the Company. See Notes 8 and 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appear in Item 8 of this Report.\n(k) Within the Company's calculation of Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share above, each reconciling item includes the impact of any current and deferred income tax expense (benefit) as applicable. The income tax expense (benefit) related to these items was determined utilizing the applicable rates in the taxing jurisdictions in which these adjustments occurred.\n(l) The Company calculates Adjusted EBITDA margin as the percentage of Adjusted EBITDA to consolidated net sales.\nOperations\nConsolidated Operations Review - Comparison of 2018 with 2017\nNet sales grew $47.4 million or 6% in 2018, increasing to $867.5 million compared to $820.1 million in 2017. The Company's 2018 net sales benefited from increases in volume of 3%, selling price and product mix of 2%, as well as a positive impact from foreign currency translation of less than 1% or $3.7 million.\nCost of goods sold ( COGS\u201d) in 2018 of $555.2 million increased 5% from $528.6 million in 2017. The increase in COGS was primarily due to the increase in product volumes, noted above, the impact of certain raw material cost increases, changes in product mix and the negative impact of foreign currency translation year-over-year.\nGross profit in 2018 increased $20.8 million or 7% compared to 2017, primarily driven by the increase in net sales and product volumes, noted above, as well as a higher gross margin of 36.0% in 2018 compared to 35.5% in 2017. The increase in the Company's gross margin in 2018 was primarily driven by pricing initiatives and the mix of certain products sold which more than offset increases in raw material costs.\nSG&A in 2018 increased $9.1 million compared to 2017 due to higher labor-related costs, primarily from annual merit increases and incentive-based compensation due to the Company's strong operating performance, as well as the negative impact from foreign currency translation. These increases year-over-year were partially offset by a first quarter of 2017 cost streamlining initiative described in the Non-GAAP measures section of this Item, above.\nDuring 2018, the Company incurred $16.7 million of costs related to its previously announced pending Combination with Houghton, described in the Non-GAAP measures section of this Item, above. Comparatively, the Company incurred $29.9 million of similar combination-related expenses in 2017 as well as certain due diligence-related costs.\nOperating income in 2018 was $87.8 million compared to $62.7 million in 2017. The increase in operating income was due to strong net sales and gross profit increases as well as lower Houghton combination-related expenses, noted above, partially offset by an increase in SG&A not related to the pending Houghton combination.\nThe Company had other expense, net, of $0.6 million in 2018 compared to $0.7 million in 2017. The decrease in other expense, net, includes both a $1.9 million settlement charge in one of the Company's U.S. pension plans and a $0.1 million loss on the disposal of a held for sale asset in 2017, as well as a 2018 gain of $0.6 million on the sale of a held-for-sale asset. The positive year-over-year impact of these items was partially offset by $0.5 million lower year-over-year cash proceeds received from an insolvent insurance carrier with respect to previously filed recovery claims by an inactive subsidiary of the Company. In addition to all of these items, which are described in the Non-GAAP measures section of this Item, above, the Company also had foreign currency transaction losses in 2018 compared to foreign currency transaction gains in 2017. The Company's 2018 foreign currency transaction losses included both recurring transactional activity as well as foreign currency transaction losses of approximately $0.4 million related to the Company's Argentina subsidiary and a foreign currency transaction gain of approximately $0.4 million related to the liquidation of an inactive legal entity, both of which are described in the Non-GAAP measures section of this Item, above. Lastly, the Company had a decrease in receipts of local municipality-related grants in one of the Company's regions year-over-year.\nInterest expense increased $2.3 million year-over-year, primarily due to higher 2018 costs incurred to maintain the bank commitment for the pending Houghton Combination, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense due to lower average outstanding borrowings on the Company's existing credit facility during 2018 compared to 2017. Interest income was $0.4 million lower in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to changes in the level of the Company's invested cash in certain regions with higher returns as well as a decrease in interest received on certain tax-related credits year-over-year.\nThe Company's effective tax rates for 2018 and 2017 were 30.1% and 68.7%, respectively. The Company's elevated 2018 and 2017 effective tax rates were impacted by its initial estimate and subsequent adjustments related to U.S. Tax Reform, as well as certain non-deductible Houghton combination-related expenses in both years, described in the Non-GAAP measures section of this Item, above. Excluding these items in each period, the Company estimates that its 2018 and 2017 effective tax rates would have been approximately 22% and 27%, respectively. The decrease in the Company's effective tax rate year-over-year was primarily due to a shift in earnings to lower tax jurisdictions and a lower U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% in 2018 compared to 35% in 2017. The Company has experienced and expects to continue to experience volatility in its effective tax rates due to several factors, including the timing of tax audits and the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations as they relate to uncertain tax positions, the unpredictability of the timing and amount of certain incentives in various tax jurisdictions, the treatment of certain acquisition-related costs and the timing and amount of certain share-based compensation-related tax benefits, among other factors.\nEquity in net income of associated companies ( equity income\u201d) decreased $1.5 million in 2018 compared to 2017. The decrease was primarily due to lower earnings from the Company's interest in a captive insurance company in 2018, partially offset by higher currency conversion charges in 2017 related to the Company's hyper-inflationary Venezuelan affiliate, both described in the Non-GAAP measures section of this Item, above.\nThe Company had a $1.7 million decrease in net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to the Company's purchase of the remaining interest in its India joint venture during December 2017.\nForeign exchange negatively impacted the Company's 2018 earnings by approximately 1% or $0.08 per diluted share, driven by the negative impact of net foreign currency transaction losses year-over-year, noted above, partially offset by a positive impact from foreign currency translation.\nConsolidated Operations Review - Comparison of 2017 with 2016\nNet sales in 2017 of $820.1 million increased 10% compared to net sales of $746.7 million in 2016. The $73.4 million increase in net sales was the result of a 6% increase in organic volumes, a 1% or $10.7 million increase from sales attributable to the Company's 2016 acquisition of Lubricor Inc. and its affiliate entities ( Lubricor\u201d), a 2% increase due to changes in selling price and product mix and the positive impact of foreign currency translation of $4.9 million or 1%.\nCOGS in 2017 of $528.6 million increased 13% from $466.6 million in 2016. The increase in COGS was primarily due to the increase in product volumes, noted above, as well as additional COGS attributed to the Company's 2016 acquisition of Lubricor, the impact of certain raw material cost increases, changes in product mix and the negative impact of foreign currency translation year-over-year.\nGross profit in 2017 increased $11.4 million or 4% compared to 2016, primarily driven by the increase in sales volumes, noted above, partially offset by a lower gross margin of 35.5% in 2017 compared to 37.5% in 2016. The decrease in the Company's gross margin in 2017 was primarily due to higher raw material costs compared to 2016 and a change in the mix of certain products sold.\nSG&A in 2017 increased $5.1 million compared to 2016 primarily due to additional SG&A associated with the Company's 2016 Lubricor acquisition, an increase due to the impact of foreign currency translation, higher labor-related costs primarily due to annual compensation increases and incentive compensation, as well as a first quarter of 2017 cost streamlining initiative, described in the Non-GAAP measures section of this Item, above. These increases to SG&A were partially offset by decreases as a result of certain cost savings efforts, including the impact of the 2015 global restructuring program in 2017.\nThe Company substantially completed the 2015 global restructuring program during 2016 and recognized a restructuring credit of $0.4 million during the fourth quarter of 2016 to update its initial estimates for employee separation costs. There were no comparable restructuring costs or credits during 2017.\nDuring 2017, the Company incurred $29.9 million of costs related to its previously announced Combination with Houghton, described in the Non-GAAP measures section of this Item, above. The Company incurred $1.5 million of similar combination-related expenses in 2016.\nOperating income in 2017 was $62.7 million compared to $85.4 million in 2016. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to the higher Houghton combination-related expenses along with slightly higher levels of SG&A not related to the Houghton Combination, which more than offset gross profit increases on strong volume growth, noted above.\nThe Company had other expense, net, of $0.7 million in 2017 compared to $0.5 million in 2016. The increase in other expense, net, was primarily driven by a second quarter of 2017 U.S. pension plan settlement charge and a fourth quarter of 2017 loss on the disposal of a held-for-sale asset, partially offset by income associated with an insurance insolvency recovery in the fourth quarter of 2017, all of which are described in the Non-GAAP measures section of this Item, above. In addition, the Company had higher foreign currency transaction gains realized in 2017 compared to 2016 and an increase in receipts of local municipality-related grants in one of the Company's regions year-over-year.\nInterest expense increased $1.0 million year-over-year, primarily due to costs incurred to maintain the committed capital for the pending Houghton Combination. Interest income increased $0.5 million in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to an increase in the level of the Company's invested cash in certain regions with higher returns.\nThe Company's effective tax rates for 2017 and 2016 were 68.7% and 27.6%, respectively. The primary drivers of the increase in the Company's effective tax rate during 2017 were the impact of certain non-deductible Houghton combination-related expenses as well as $22.2 million of charges related to U.S. Tax Reform, described in the Non-GAAP measures section of this Item, above. The Company estimates that its 2017 effective tax rate would have been approximately 27%, without the impact of U.S. Tax Reform and non-deductible Houghton combination-related expenses. These increases to the 2017 effective tax rate were partially offset by the favorable impact of tax benefits for deductions in excess of compensation cost associated with stock option exercises and restricted stock vesting in 2017. In 2016, there were minimal non-deductible Houghton combination-related expenses, no charges similar to those of the 2017 U.S. Tax Reform and no comparable share-based compensation-related tax benefits. Also, in both 2017 and 2016, the Company's mix of foreign earnings in jurisdictions with lower effective tax rates impacted each year's tax expense.\nEquity income increased $1.0 million in 2017 compared to 2016. The increase in equity income was primarily due to higher earnings from the Company's interest in a captive insurance company in 2017. In addition, the Company recorded hyper-inflationary accounting currency conversion charges in both 2017 and 2016, respectively, associated with the Company's Venezuela affiliate. The Company's interest in a captive insurance company and the currency conversion charges recorded are described in the Non-GAAP measures section of this Item, above.\nThe Company had a $0.4 million increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to an increase in performance from certain consolidated affiliates in the Company's Asia/Pacific region partially offset by the impact of the Company's purchase of the remaining interest in its India joint venture in December 2017.\nForeign exchange in total had minimal impact on the Company's 2017 earnings, as a negative impact from foreign currency translation of less than 1% or $0.01 per diluted share and the Venezuela hyper-inflationary currency conversion charges, noted above, were offset by the positive impact of higher foreign currency transaction gains year-over-year.\nReportable Operating Segment Review - Comparison of 2018 with 2017\nThe Company sells its industrial process fluids, chemical specialties and technical expertise to a wide range of industries in a global product portfolio throughout its four segments: (i) North America, (ii) EMEA, (iii) Asia/Pacific and (iv) South America.\nNorth America\nNorth America represented approximately 44% of the Company's consolidated net sales in 2018. The segment's net sales were $383.5 million, an increase of $26.9 million or 8% compared to 2017. The increase in net sales was primarily due to higher volumes of 4% and an increase in selling price and product mix of 4%. This reportable segment's operating earnings, excluding indirect expenses, were $88.3 million, an increase of $10.6 million or 14% compared to 2017. The increase in operating earnings year-over-year was the result of higher gross profit on the higher net sales noted above, coupled with an increase in gross margin due to changes in product mix and the impact of pricing initiatives which more than offset raw material cost increases. These increases to the segment's 2018 operating earnings were partially offset by higher SG&A, primarily due to higher labor costs associated with annual merit increases and improved segment performance.\nEMEA\nEMEA represented approximately 27% of the Company's consolidated net sales in 2018. The segment's net sales were $233.6 million, an increase of $7.4 million or 3% compared to 2017. The increase in net sales was primarily due to the positive impact of foreign currency translation of 4% and increases in selling price and product mix of 3%, partially offset by lower volumes of 4%. The year-over-year volume comparison was impacted by an atypically high sales pattern in EMEA during the first quarter of 2017, a decrease in volume associated with a specific piece of business which the Company stopped selling during the second half of 2018 primarily due to its limited profitability, and a slowing of orders at the end of 2018 due to market challenges in Europe. The foreign exchange impact was primarily due to a strengthening of the euro against the U.S. dollar as this exchange rate averaged 1.18 in 2018 compared to 1.13 in 2017. This reportable segment's operating earnings, excluding indirect expenses, were $36.0 million, an increase of $0.6 million or 2% compared to 2017. The increase in operating earnings year-over-year was the result of higher gross profit on the higher net sales noted above, coupled with an increase in gross margin due to changes in product mix and the impact of pricing initiatives which more than offset raw material cost increases. These increases to the segment's 2018 operating earnings were partially offset by higher SG&A, primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation as well as higher labor costs associated with annual merit increases.\nAsia/Pacific\nAsia/Pacific represented approximately 25% of the Company's consolidated net sales in 2018. The segment's net sales were $214.2 million, an increase of $13.1 million or 7% compared to 2017. The increase in net sales was primarily due to higher volumes of 8% partially offset by a decrease in selling price and product mix of 1%. This reportable segment's operating earnings, excluding indirect expenses, were $56.1 million, an increase of $7.7 million or 16% compared to 2017. The increase in operating earnings year-over-year was primarily driven by higher gross profit on the increase in net sales, noted above, coupled with an increase in gross margin due to changes in product mix and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in SG&A due to lower labor expenses.\nSouth America\nSouth America represented approximately 4% of the Company's consolidated net sales in 2018. The segment's net sales were $36.3 million, an increase of $0.1 million or less than 1% compared to 2017. The slight increase in net sales was primarily due to higher volumes of 8% and an increase in selling price and product mix of approximately 7%, offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation of 15%. The foreign exchange impact was primarily due to a weakening of both the Brazilian real and Argentinian peso against the U.S. dollar as these exchange rates averaged 3.63 and 26.13 in 2018 compared to 3.19 and 16.50 in 2017, respectively. This reportable segment's operating earnings, excluding indirect expenses, were $3.9 million in both 2018 and 2017. This flat year-over-year operating earnings in South America was the result of the slight increase in net sales, noted above, and lower SG&A largely due to foreign currency translation, partially offset by a lower gross margin on raw material changes and impacts due to foreign currency translation.\nReportable Operating Segment Review - Comparison of 2017 with 2016\nNorth America\nNorth America represented approximately 43% of the Company's consolidated net sales in 2017. The segment's net sales were $356.6 million, an increase of $20.4 million or 6% compared to 2016. The increase in net sales was primarily due to higher volumes of 3%, including acquisitions, and an increase in selling price and product mix of 3%. This reportable segment's operating earnings, excluding indirect expenses, were $77.7 million, a decrease of $0.1 million compared to 2016. North America's relatively consistent operating earnings were the net result of a decline in gross margin and higher levels of SG&A, which offset higher gross profit on the increase in net sales, noted above. The decline in gross margin was due to increases in certain raw material costs and changes in product mix. The higher SG&A was primarily due to increases in labor costs primarily associated with annual merit increases and additional SG&A associated with the Lubricor acquisition.\nEMEA\nEMEA represented approximately 28% of the Company's consolidated net sales in 2017. The segment's net sales were $226.2 million, an increase of $25.3 million or 13% compared to 2016. The increase in net sales was primarily due to higher volumes of 7%, an increase in selling price and product mix of 4% and the positive impact of foreign currency translation of 2%. Included in the 2017 volume increase was an atypically high sales pattern in the first quarter. The foreign exchange impact was primarily due to a strengthening of the euro against the U.S. dollar, as this exchange rate averaged approximately 1.13 in 2017 compared to approximately 1.10 in 2016. This reportable segment's operating earnings, excluding indirect expenses, were $35.4 million, an increase of $1.5 million or 5% compared to 2016. The increase in EMEA's operating earnings was driven by higher gross profit on the increase in net sales, noted above, partially offset by a lower gross margin due to increases in certain raw material costs and product mix and slightly higher SG&A year-over-year due to increases in labor costs primarily associated with annual merit increases and improved segment performance.\nAsia/Pacific\nAsia/Pacific represented approximately 25% of the Company's consolidated net sales in 2017. The segment's net sales were $201.0 million, an increase of $21.9 million or 12% compared to 2016. The increase in net sales was primarily due to higher volumes of 16% partially offset by a decrease in selling price and product mix of 4% and the negative impact of foreign currency translation of less than 1%. The foreign exchange impact was primarily due to a weakening of the Chinese renminbi against the U.S. dollar, which offset a strengthening of the Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar, year-over-year. These exchange rates averaged 6.75 and 65.1 in 2017 compared to 6.64 and 67.18 in 2016, respectively. This reportable segment's operating earnings, excluding indirect expenses, were $48.3 million, an increase of $2.5 million or 5% compared to 2016. The increase in Asia/Pacific's operating earnings was driven by higher gross profit on the increase in net sales, noted above, partially offset by a lower gross margin due to increases in certain raw material costs and product mix and slightly higher SG&A year-over-year due to increases in labor costs primarily associated with annual merit increases and improved segment performance.\nSouth America\nSouth America represented approximately 4% of the Company's consolidated net sales in 2017. The segment's net sales were $36.2 million, an increase of $5.8 million or 19% compared to 2016. The increase in net sales was primarily due to higher volumes of 6%, an increase in selling price and product mix of 7% and the positive impact of foreign currency translation of 6%. The foreign exchange impact was primarily due to a strengthening of the Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar, which offset a weakening of the Argentinian peso against the U.S. dollar, year-over-year. These exchange rates averaged 3.19 and 16.50 in 2017 compared 3.47 and 14.73 in 2016, respectively. This reportable segment's operating earnings, excluding indirect expenses, were $3.9 million, an increase of $2.5 million or 183% compared to 2016. The increase in South America's operating earnings was driven by higher gross profit on the increase in net sales, as well as a higher gross margin primarily due to pricing initiatives and lower raw material costs. These increases to operating earnings year-over-year were partially offset by slightly higher SG&A due to increases in labor costs primarily associated with annual merit increases and improved segment performance.\nEnvironmental Clean-up Activities\nThe Company is involved in environmental clean-up activities in connection with an existing plant location and former waste disposal sites. In 1992, the Company identified certain soil and groundwater contamination at AC Products, Inc. ( ACP\u201d), a wholly owned subsidiary. In voluntary coordination with the Santa Ana California Regional Water Quality Board, ACP has been remediating the contamination. In 2007, ACP agreed to operate two groundwater treatment systems, so as to hydraulically contain groundwater contamination emanating from ACP's site until such time as the concentrations of contaminants are below the current Federal maximum contaminant level for four consecutive quarterly sampling events. In 2014, ACP ceased operation at one of its two groundwater treatment systems, as it had met the above condition for closure. As of December 31, 2018, ACP believes it is close to meeting the conditions for closure of the remaining groundwater treatment system but continues to operate this system while in discussions with the relevant authorities and believes that the range of potential-known liabilities associated with the balance of ACP's water remediation program is approximately $0.1 million to $1.0 million. The low and high ends of the range are based on the length of operation of the treatment system as required by the conditions noted above, as determined by groundwater modeling. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company cannot be certain that future liabilities in the form of remediation expenses and damages will not be in excess of the high end of the range. See Note 25 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report.\nGeneral\nSee", "item_7_tables": "Table 19: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1/2 Percentage

</tr>\n</table>", "summary": "The Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) report of Quaker Chemical Corporation for 2018 provides a comprehensive overview of the company's financial conditions and the results of its operations for the year. Quaker Chemical Corporation is a global provider of process fluids, chemical specialties, and technical services and has been operating for over 100 years.\n\nIn 2018, Quaker reported strong operating results with steady growth. Specifically, net sales increased by 6% to $867.5 million, driven by a combination of volume growth and improvements in selling price and product mix. This led to a 7% increase in gross profit compared to the previous year. Operating income as a percentage of sales also improved, thanks to disciplined expense management, particularly in selling, general, and administrative expenses.\n\nNet income and earnings per diluted share for the company rose significantly to $59.5 million and $4.45, respectively, from $20.3 million and $1.52 in 2017. However, costs of $19.5 million were incurred in relation to the planned combination with Houghton International, Inc. ('the Combination'). The company's non-GAAP earnings per diluted share increased by 21% to $6.04 compared to $5.01 in 2017, reflecting robust operating performance and a lower effective tax rate.\n\nRegionally, North America and Asia/Pacific regions experienced particularly strong operating earnings, while the EMEA region managed to offset challenges like a decline in volume, and the South America region maintained consistent operating earnings despite significant currency translation impacts.\n\nNet operating cash flow improved to $78.8 million in 2018, up from $64.8 million in 2017, primarily driven by strong operational performance. The company generated this despite challenges such as foreign exchange headwinds.\n\nLooking ahead to 2019, Quaker estimates it will receive final regulatory approval and close the Combination within the next few months, which will approximately double the company's annual sales and adjusted EBITDA. However, the company anticipates potential headwinds, particularly in the early months of 2019, such as the impact of a strong U.S. dollar and global economic uncertainty. Nonetheless, Quaker expects the year to be successful based on anticipated market share gains and growth in its end markets.\n\nThe MD&A also discusses critical accounting policies and estimates which influence Quaker's financial statements in areas like customer sales incentives, inventories, environmental and litigation reserves, tax positions, and valuation allowances among others.\n\nLastly, the MD&A explores Quaker's Liquidity and Capital Resources, providing an outlook on cash, investments, and anticipated expenditures related to the Combination, ongoing operations, and other capital allocation priorities."}
