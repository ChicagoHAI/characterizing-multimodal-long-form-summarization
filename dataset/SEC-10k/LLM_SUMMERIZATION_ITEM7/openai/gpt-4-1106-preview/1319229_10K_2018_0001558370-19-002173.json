MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a refined petroleum products terminaling and pipeline transportation company formed in February 2005 as a Delaware limited partnership. Following the consummation of our Take-Private Transaction, we are wholly owned by TLP Finance Holdings, LLC, an indirect controlled subsidiary of ArcLight, and we have converted into a Delaware limited liability company pursuant to Section 17-219 of the Delaware Limited Partnership Act. Prior to the consummation of our Take-Private Transaction, we were controlled by our general partner, which was controlled by ArcLight.\nWe provide integrated terminaling, storage, transportation and related services for customers engaged in the distribution and marketing of light refined petroleum products, heavy refined petroleum products, crude oil, chemicals, fertilizers and other liquid products. Light refined products include gasolines, diesel fuels, heating oil and jet fuels. Heavy refined products include residual fuel oils and asphalt.\nWe do not take ownership of or market products that we handle or transport and, therefore, we are not directly exposed to changes in commodity prices, except for the value of product gains and losses arising from certain of our terminaling services agreements with our customers. The volume of product that is handled, transported through or stored in our terminals and pipelines is directly affected by the level of supply and demand in the wholesale markets served by our terminals and pipelines. Overall supply of refined products in the wholesale markets is influenced by the products' absolute prices, the availability of capacity on delivering pipelines and vessels, fluctuating refinery margins and the markets' perception of future product prices. The demand for gasoline typically peaks during the summer driving season, which extends from April to September, and declines during the fall and winter months. The demand for marine fuels typically peaks in the winter months due to the increase in the number of cruise ships originating from the Florida ports. Despite these seasonalities, the overall impact on the volume of product throughput in our terminals and pipelines is not material.\nNATURE OF ASSETS\nGulf Coast Operations. Our Gulf Coast terminals consist of eight refined product terminals and is the largest terminal network in Florida. These terminals have approximately 6.9 million barrels of aggregate active storage capacity in ports including Port Everglades, Miami and Cape Canaveral, which are among the busiest cruise ship ports in the nation. At our Gulf Coast terminals, we handle refined products and crude oil on behalf of, and provide integrated terminaling services to, customers engaged in the distribution and marketing of refined products and crude oil.\nMidwest Terminals and Pipeline Operations. In Missouri and Arkansas, we own and operate the Razorback pipeline and terminals in Mount Vernon, Missouri, at the origin of the pipeline and in Rogers, Arkansas, at the terminus of the pipeline. We refer to these two terminals collectively as the Razorback terminals. The Razorback pipeline is a 67-mile, 8-inch diameter interstate common carrier pipeline that transports light refined product from our terminal at Mount Vernon, where it is interconnected with a pipeline system owned by a third party, to our terminal at Rogers. The Razorback pipeline has a capacity of approximately 30,000 barrels per day. The razorback terminals have approximately\n\t\t\n0.4 million barrels of aggregate active storage capacity. Our Rogers facility is the only refined products terminal located in Northwest Arkansas.\nWe also own and operate a terminal facility in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma with approximately 0.2 million barrels of aggregate active storage capacity. Our Oklahoma City terminal receives gasolines and diesel fuels from a pipeline system owned by a third party for delivery via our truck rack for redistribution to locations throughout the Oklahoma City region.\nWe leased a portion of land in Cushing, Oklahoma and constructed storage tanks and associated infrastructure on the property for the receipt of crude oil by truck and pipeline, the blending of crude oil and the storage of approximately 1.0 million barrels of crude oil.\nBrownsville, Texas Operations. We own and operate a refined product terminal with approximately 0.8 million barrels of aggregate active storage capacity and related ancillary facilities in Brownsville independent of the Frontera joint venture, as well as the Diamondback pipeline which handles liquid product movements between south Texas and Mexico. At our Brownsville terminal we handle refined petroleum products, chemicals, vegetable oils, naphtha, wax and propane on behalf of, and provide integrated terminaling services to, customers engaged in the distribution and marketing of refined products and natural gas liquids.\nThe Diamondback pipeline consists of an 8\u201d pipeline that previously transported propane approximately 16 miles from our Brownsville facilities to the United States/Mexico border and a 6\u201d pipeline, which runs parallel to the 8\u201d pipeline that can be used by us in the future to transport additional refined products to Matamoros, Mexico. The 8\u201d pipeline has a capacity of approximately 20,000 barrels per day. The 6\u201d pipeline has a capacity of approximately 12,000 barrels per day. Operations on the Diamondback pipeline were shut down in the fourth quarter of 2017; however, we expect to recommission the Diamondback pipeline and resume operations by the end of 2019.\nIn 2018 and prior thereto, we also operated and maintained the United States portion of a 174-mile refined products pipeline owned by a third party. This pipeline connects our Brownsville terminal complex to a pipeline in Mexico that delivers to a third party terminal located in Reynosa, Mexico and terminates at the third party's refinery, located in Cadereyta, Nuevo Leon, Mexico, a suburb of the large industrial city of Monterrey. Our services for this pipeline terminated on August 23, 2018, and a third party has taken operatorship of the pipeline.\nRiver Operations. Our River terminals are composed of 12 refined product terminals located along the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers with approximately 2.7 million barrels of aggregate active storage capacity. Our River operations also include a dock facility in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, which is the only direct waterborne connection between the Colonial pipeline and Mississippi River waterborne transportation. At our River terminals, we handle gasolines, diesel fuels, heating oil, chemicals and fertilizers on behalf of, and provide integrated terminaling services to, customers engaged in the distribution and marketing of refined products and industrial and commercial end-users.\nSoutheast Operations. Our Southeast terminals consist of 22 refined product terminals located along the Colonial and Plantation pipelines in Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia with an aggregate active storage capacity of approximately 12.0 million barrels. At our Southeast terminals, we handle gasolines, diesel fuels, ethanol, biodiesel, jet fuel and heating oil on behalf of, and provide integrated terminaling services to, customers engaged in the distribution and marketing of refined products. Our Southeast terminals primarily receive products from the Plantation and Colonial pipelines on behalf of our customers and distribute products primarily to trucks with the exception of the Collins bulk storage terminal. The Collins terminal, currently going through expansions, is the only independent terminal capable of storing and redelivering product to, from and between the Colonial and Plantation pipelines.\nWest Coast Operations. Our West Coast terminals consist of two refined product terminals with approximately 5.3 million barrels of aggregate active storage capacity. The terminals are strategically located in close proximity to three San Francisco Bay refineries and the origin of the North California products pipeline distribution system. At our West Coast terminals, we handle crude oil, gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, gasoline blend stocks, fuel oil, Avgas and ethanol on behalf of, and provide integrated terminaling services to, customers engaged in the distribution and marketing of refined products. We acquired the West Coast terminals in December 2017.\n\t\t\nInvestment in Frontera. On April 1, 2011, we contributed approximately 1.5 million barrels of light petroleum product storage capacity, as well as related ancillary facilities, to the Frontera joint venture, in exchange for a cash payment of approximately $25.6 million and a 50% ownership interest in the Frontera joint venture. An affiliate of PEMEX, Mexico's state owned petroleum company, acquired the remaining 50% ownership interest in Frontera for a cash payment of approximately $25.6 million. We operate the Frontera assets under an operations and reimbursement agreement between us and Frontera. Frontera has approximately 1.7 million barrels of aggregate active storage capacity. Our 50% ownership interest does not allow us to control Frontera, but does allow us to exercise significant influence over its operations. Accordingly, we account for our investment in Frontera under the equity method of accounting.\nInvestment in BOSTCO. On December 20, 2012, we acquired a 42.5% Class A ownership interest in BOSTCO from Kinder Morgan Battleground Oil, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Kinder Morgan. BOSTCO is a terminal facility on the Houston Ship Channel designed to handle residual fuel, feedstocks, distillates and other black oils. BOSTCO has approximately 7.1 million barrels of aggregate active storage capacity. Our investment in BOSTCO entitles us to appoint a member to the Board of Managers of BOSTCO, to vote our proportionate ownership share on general governance matters and to certain rights of approval over significant changes in, or expansion of, BOSTCO's business. Kinder Morgan is responsible for managing BOSTCO's day-to-day operations. Our 42.5% Class A ownership interest does not allow us to control BOSTCO, but does allow us to exercise significant influence over its operations. Accordingly, we account for our investment in BOSTCO under the equity method of accounting.\nNATURE OF REVENUE AND EXPENSES\nWe derive revenue from our terminal and pipeline transportation operations by charging fees for providing integrated terminaling, transportation and related services. We have several significant customer relationships that made up 85% of the total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. These relationships include: NGL Energy Partners LP, Castleton Commodities International LLC, RaceTrac Petroleum Inc., Glencore Ltd., Tesoro, Musket Corporation, BP, Associated Asphalt, Magellan Pipeline Company, L.P., United States Government, Valero Marketing and Supply Company, PMI Trading Ltd., Exxon Mobil Oil Corporation, World Fuel Services Corporation, Chevron Corporation, Shell and Andeavor.\nThe fees we charge, our other sources of revenue and our direct costs and expenses are described below.\nTerminaling services fees. Our terminaling services agreements are structured as either throughput agreements or storage agreements. Our throughput agreements contain provisions that require our customers to make minimum payments, which are based on contractually established minimum volume of throughput of the customer's product at our facilities over a stipulated period of time. Due to this minimum payment arrangement, we recognize a fixed amount of revenue from the customer over a certain period of time, even if the customer throughputs less than the minimum volume of product during that period. In addition, if a customer throughputs a volume of product exceeding the minimum volume, we would recognize additional revenue on this incremental volume. Our storage agreements require our customers to make minimum payments based on the volume of storage capacity available to the customer under the agreement, which results in a fixed amount of recognized revenue. We refer to the fixed amount of revenue recognized pursuant to our terminaling services agreements as being firm commitments.\u201d Revenue recognized in excess of firm commitments and revenue recognized based solely on the volume of product distributed or injected are referred to as ancillary.\u201d In addition, ancillary\u201d revenue also includes fees received from ancillary services including heating and mixing of stored products, product transfer, railcar handling, butane blending, proceeds from the sale of product gains, wharfage and vapor recovery.\nPipeline transportation fees. We earn pipeline transportation fees at our Diamondback pipeline either based on the volume of product transported or under capacity reservation agreements. Revenue associated with the capacity reservation is recognized ratably over the respective term, regardless of whether the capacity is actually utilized. We earn pipeline transportation fees at our Razorback pipeline based on an allocation of the aggregate fees charged under the capacity agreement with our customer who has contracted for 100% of our Razorback system.\nManagement fees and reimbursed costs. We manage and operate certain tank capacity at our Port Everglades South terminal for a major oil company and receive a reimbursement of its proportionate share of operating and maintenance costs. We manage and operate the Frontera joint venture and receive a management fee based on our costs\n\t\t\nincurred. We manage and operate rail sites at certain Southeast terminals on behalf of a major oil company and receive reimbursement for operating and maintenance costs We lease land under operating leases and thereafter receive a fee as the lessor or sublessor from third parties and, in certain cases, our affiliates. We also managed and operated for an affiliate of PEMEX, Mexico's state-owned petroleum company, a products pipeline connected to our Brownsville terminal facility and received a management fee through August 23, 2018.\nDirect operating costs and expenses. The direct operating costs and expenses of our operations include the directly related wages and employee benefits, utilities, communications, maintenance and repairs, property taxes, rent, vehicle expenses, environmental compliance costs, materials and supplies needed to operate our terminals and pipelines.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses include direct general and administrative expenses for costs and expenses of employees performing engineering, health, safety and environmental services, third party accounting costs associated with annual and quarterly reports and tax return and Schedule K-1 preparation and distribution, legal fees and independent director fees. General and administrative expenses also include fees paid to ArcLight under the omnibus agreement to cover the costs of centralized corporate functions such as legal, accounting, treasury, insurance administration and claims processing, information technology, human resources, credit, payroll, taxes and other corporate services.\nInsurance expenses. Insurance expenses include charges for insurance premiums to cover costs of insuring activities such as property, casualty, pollution, automobile, directors' and officers' liability, and other insurable risks.\nSIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS SINCE THE FILING OF OUR PRIOR YEAR FORM 10-K\nTAKE-PRIVATE TRANSACTION\nOn February 26, 2019, an affiliate of ArcLight completed its previously announced acquisition of all of the Partnership's outstanding publicly traded common units not already held by ArcLight and its affiliates by way of our merger (the Merger\u201d) with a wholly owned subsidiary of TLP Finance Holdings, LLC ( TLP Finance\u201d), an indirect controlled subsidiary of Arclight. At the effective time of the Merger, each of the Partnership's general partner units issued and outstanding immediately prior to the acquisition effective time was converted into (i)(a) one Partnership common unit, and (i)(b) in aggregate, a non-economic general partner interest in the Partnership, (ii) each of the Partnership's incentive distribution rights issued and outstanding immediately prior to the acquisition effective time was converted into 100 Partnership common units, (iii) our general partner distributed its common units in the Partnership (the Transferred GP Units\u201d) to TLP Acquisition Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( TLP Holdings\u201d), and TLP Holdings contributed the Transferred GP Units to TLP Finance, (iv) the Partnership converted into the Company (a Delaware limited liability company) pursuant to Section 17-219 of the Delaware Limited Partnership Act and changed its name to TransMontaigne Partners LLC\u201d, and all of our common units owned by TLP Finance were converted into limited liability company interests, (v) the non-economic interest in the Company owned by our general partner was automatically cancelled and ceased to exist and our general partner merged with and into the Company with the Company surviving, and (vi) the Company became 100% owned by TLP Finance (the transactions described in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv), collectively with the Merger, the Take-Private Transaction\u201d).\nAs a result of the Take-Private Transaction, our common units ceased to be publicly traded, and our common units are no longer listed on the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE\u201d). Our currently outstanding 6.125% senior unsecured notes due in 2026 remain outstanding, and the Company is voluntarily filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the covenants contained in those notes.\nEXPANSION OF ASSETS\nExpansion of our Brownsville operations. The Frontera joint venture has waived its right of first refusal to participate in our previously announced Brownsville terminal expansion. Accordingly, our Brownsville expansion project will be 100% constructed and owned by the Company. The project, which is underpinned by new long-term agreements, includes the construction of approximately 630,000 barrels of additional liquids storage capacity and the conversion of our Diamondback Pipeline to transport diesel and gasoline to the U.S./Mexico border. The Diamondback\n\t\t\nPipeline is comprised of an 8\u201d pipeline that previously transported propane approximately 16 miles from our Brownsville facilities to the U.S./Mexico border, as well as a 6\u201d pipeline, which runs parallel to the 8\u201d pipeline, that has been idle and can be used to transport additional refined products. We expect the first tanks of the additional liquids storage capacity under construction to be placed into commercial service during the first quarter of 2019. We expect to recommission the Diamondback Pipeline and resume operations on both the 8\u201d pipeline and the previously idle 6\u201d pipeline by the end of 2019, with the remaining additional liquids storage capacity being placed into commercial service at the same time. The anticipated aggregate cost of the terminal expansion and pipeline recommissioning is estimated to be approximately $55 million.\nExpansion of our Collins terminal. Our Collins, Mississippi terminal complex is strategically located for the bulk storage market and is the only independent terminal capable of receiving from, delivering to, and transferring refined petroleum products between the Colonial and Plantation pipeline systems. We continue to implement the design and construction of approximately 870,000 barrels of new storage capacity supported by the execution of a new long-term, fee-based terminaling services agreement with a third party customer, which constitutes the beginning of a Phase II buildout. To facilitate our further expansion of tankage at our Collins terminal, we also entered into an agreement with Colonial Pipeline Company for significant improvements to the Colonial Pipeline receipt and delivery manifolds and our related receipt and delivery facilities. The improvements will result in significant increased flexibility for our Collins terminal customers including the simultaneous receipt and delivery of gasoline from and to Colonial's Line 1 at full line rates including the ability to receive and deliver segregated batches at these rates; a dedicated and segregated line for the receipt and delivery of distillates from and to Colonial's Line 2; and a dedicated and segregated line for the receipt and delivery of jet fuel from and to Colonial's Line 2. The anticipated cost of the approximately 870,000 barrels of new storage capacity and our share of the improvements to the pipeline connections is approximately $55 million, with expected annual cash returns in the low-teens. We are currently in active discussions with several other existing and prospective customers regarding additional future capacity at our Collins terminal. We expect the first of the new tanks to come online in the first quarter of 2019 and the Colonial Pipeline Company improvements to come online in the second quarter of 2019.\nExpansion of our West Coast terminals. On December 15, 2017, we acquired the West Coast terminals from a third party for a total purchase price of approximately $276.8 million. The West Coast terminals consist of two waterborne refined product and crude oil terminals located in the San Francisco Bay Area refining complex with a total of 64 storage tanks with approximately 5.3 million barrels of active storage capacity. The West Coast terminals have access to domestic and international crude oil and refined products markets through marine, pipeline, truck and rail logistics capabilities.\nPursuant to a new long-term terminaling services agreement, we have begun the construction of an additional 125,000 barrels of storage capacity at our Richmond West Coast terminal. The cost of constructing this new capacity is expected to be approximately $8 million. We are also pursuing other high-return investment opportunities similar to this at these terminals. The first of the new tanks began to come online in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nA summary of the significant accounting policies that we have adopted and followed in the preparation of our historical consolidated financial statements is detailed in Note 1 of Notes to consolidated financial statements. Certain of these accounting policies require the use of estimates. The following estimates, in management's opinion, are subjective in nature, require the exercise of judgment and involve complex analyses: useful lives of our plant and equipment, accrued environmental obligations and business combination estimates and assumptions. These estimates are based on our knowledge and understanding of current conditions and actions we may take in the future. Changes in these estimates will occur as a result of the passage of time and the occurrence of future events. Subsequent changes in these estimates may have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations (see Note 1 of Notes to consolidated financial statements).\nUseful lives of plant and equipment. We calculate depreciation using the straight-line method, based on estimated useful lives of our assets. These estimates are based on various factors including age (in the case of acquired assets), manufacturing specifications, technological advances and historical data concerning useful lives of similar\n\t\t\nassets. Uncertainties that impact these estimates include changes in laws and regulations relating to restoration, economic conditions and supply and demand in the area. When assets are put into service, we make estimates with respect to useful lives that we believe to be reasonable. However, subsequent events could cause us to change our estimates, thus impacting the future calculation of depreciation. Estimated useful lives are 15 to 25 years for terminals and pipelines and 3 to 25 years for furniture, fixtures and equipment.\nAccrued environmental obligations. At December 31, 2018, we have an accrued liability of approximately $1.6 million representing our best estimate of the undiscounted future payments we expect to pay for environmental costs to remediate existing conditions. Estimates of our environmental obligations are subject to change due to a number of factors and judgments involved in the estimation process, including the early stage of investigation at certain sites, the lengthy time frames required to complete remediation, technology changes affecting remediation methods, alternative remediation methods and strategies and changes in environmental laws and regulations. Changes in our estimates and assumptions may occur as a result of the passage of time and the occurrence of future events.\nCosts incurred to remediate existing contamination at the terminals have been, and are expected in the future to be, insignificant. Pursuant to agreements, an affiliate of NGL Energy Partners LP retained certain liabilities and indemnified us against certain potential environmental claims, losses and expenses associated with the operation of the acquired terminal facilities and occurring before our date of acquisition, up to a maximum liability for these indemnification obligations (not to exceed $15.0 million for the Florida and Midwest terminals acquired on May 27, 2005, not to exceed $15.0 million for the Brownsville and River facilities acquired on December 31, 2006, not to exceed $15.0 million for the Southeast terminals acquired on December 31, 2007 and not to exceed $2.5 million for the Pensacola terminal acquired on March 1, 2011). The forgoing environmental indemnifications to us remain in place and were not affected by the Take-Private Transaction.\nBusiness combination estimates and assumptions. The application of business combination and impairment accounting requires us to use significant estimates and assumptions in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities. The acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed to allocate the proper amount of the purchase price consideration between goodwill and the assets that are depreciated and amortized. We record intangible assets separately from goodwill and amortize intangible assets with finite lives over their estimated useful life as determined by management. We do not amortize goodwill but instead periodically assess goodwill for impairment.\nFor all material acquisitions, we engage the services of an independent appraiser to assist us in determining the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities, including goodwill; however, the ultimate determination of those values is the responsibility of our management. We base our estimates on assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain. These valuations require the use of management's assumptions, which would not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur.\n\t\t\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS-YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, 2017 AND 2016\nANALYSIS OF REVENUE\nTotal revenue.

Our terminaling services agreements are structured as either throughput agreements or storage agreements. Our throughput agreements contain provisions that require our customers to make minimum payments, which are based on contractually established minimum volume of throughput of the customer's product at our facilities over a stipulated period of time. Due to this minimum payment arrangement, we recognize a fixed amount of revenue from the customer over a certain period of time, even if the customer throughputs less than the minimum volume of product during that period. In addition, if a customer throughputs a volume of product exceeding the minimum volume, we would recognize additional revenue on this incremental volume. Our storage agreements require our customers to make minimum payments based on the volume of storage capacity available to the customer under the agreement, which results in a fixed amount of recognized revenue.\nWe refer to the fixed amount of revenue recognized pursuant to our terminaling services agreements as being firm commitments.\u201d Revenue recognized in excess of firm commitments and revenue recognized based solely on the volume of product distributed or injected are referred to as ancillary.\u201d In addition ancillary\u201d revenue also includes fees\n\t\t\nreceived from ancillary services including heating and mixing of stored products, product transfer, railcar handling, butane blending, proceeds from the sale of product gains, wharfage and vapor recovery.\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTerminaling Services Fees\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nby Business Segment\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGulf Coast terminals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n64,338\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n61,889\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n54,619\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMidwest terminals and pipeline system\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9,469\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBrownsville terminals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11,202\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRiver terminals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10,868\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSoutheast terminals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n82,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n75,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n58,410\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWest Coast terminals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n39,952\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,738\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTerminaling services fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n216,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n168,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n144,568\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in terminaling services fees at our Gulf Coast terminals for the year ended December 31, 2018 results from an increase in ancillary revenue.

our Southeast terminals is a result of the completion of our Phase I Collins terminal expansion project in various stages beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016 through the second quarter of 2017.\nThe increase in direct operating costs and expenses at our West Coast terminals is a result of the West Coast terminals acquisition on December 15, 2017.\nGeneral and administrative expenses include fees paid to ArcLight under the omnibus agreement to cover the costs of centralized corporate functions such as legal, accounting, treasury, insurance administration and claims processing, information technology, human resources, credit, payroll, taxes and other corporate services. General and administrative expenses also include direct general and administrative expenses for costs and expenses of employees performing engineering, health, safety and environmental services, third party accounting costs associated with annual and quarterly reports and tax return and Schedule K-1 preparation and distribution, legal fees and independent director\n\t\t\nfees. The general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were approximately $21.6 million, $19.4 million and $14.1 million, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 is primarily attributable to an increase in the omnibus fee beginning May 13, 2018 and costs associated with the Take-Private Transaction. The increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 is primarily attributable to the May 3, 2017 increase in the omnibus fee and costs for pursuing acquisition and other growth opportunities.\nInsurance expenses include charges for insurance premiums to cover costs of insuring activities such as property, casualty, pollution, automobile, directors' and officers' liability, and other insurable risks. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the insurance expense was approximately $5.0 million, $4.1 million and $4.1 million, respectively. The increase in insurance expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 is primarily attributable to the December 15, 2017 West Coast acquisition.\nEquity-based compensation expense includes expense associated with us reimbursing ArcLight for awards granted by them to certain key officers and employees who provide service to us that vest over future service periods and, prior to the consummation of the Take-Private Transaction, grants to the independent directors of our general partner under our long-term incentive plan (which was terminated, in relevant part, in connection with the Take-Private Transaction). Prior to the consummation of the Take-Private Transaction, we had the intent and ability to settle our reimbursement for the bonus awards by issuing additional common units, and accordingly, we accounted for the bonus awards as an equity award; following the Take-Private Transaction, we will settle our awards through cash compensation. The expenses associated with these reimbursements were approximately $3.5 million, $3.0 million and $3.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were approximately $49.5 million, $36.0 million and $32.4 million, respectively. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is primarily attributable to placing the Collins expansion project in service in various stages beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016 through the second quarter of 2017 and the December 15, 2017 West Coast acquisition.\nInterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was approximately $31.9 million, $10.5 million and $7.8 million, respectively. The increase in interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is primarily attributable to financing the December 15, 2017 acquisition of the West Coast terminals, the February 12, 2018 issuance of senior notes and increases in LIBOR based interest rates.\nANALYSIS OF INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES\nAt December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our investments in unconsolidated affiliates include a 42.5% Class A ownership interest in BOSTCO and a 50% ownership interest in Frontera. BOSTCO is a terminal facility located on the Houston Ship Channel that encompasses approximately 7.1 million barrels of distillate, residual and other black oil product storage. Class A and Class B ownership interests share in cash distributions on a 96.5% and 3.5% basis, respectively. Class B ownership interests do not have voting rights and are not required to make capital investments. Frontera is a terminal facility located in Brownsville, Texas that encompasses approximately 1.7 million barrels of light petroleum product storage, as well as related ancillary facilities.\nThe following table summarizes our investments in unconsolidated affiliates:\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPercentage of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCarrying value\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nownership\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBOSTCO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n42.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n42.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n203,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n209,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFrontera\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n24,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n23,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal investments in unconsolidated affiliates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n227,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n233,181\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\t\t\nEarnings from investments in unconsolidated affiliates were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBOSTCO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n5,767\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n6,933\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFrontera\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,528\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,096\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal earnings from investments in unconsolidated affiliates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n8,852\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n10,029\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in earnings from our investment in BOSTCO for the year ended December 31, 2017 is primarily attributable to increased dredging costs and the terminal being offline revenue for a few days due to Hurricane Harvey.

The increase in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 is primarily attributable to increased revenue related to placing 2.0 million barrels of new tank capacity at our Collins terminal into service in various stages\n\t\t\nbeginning in the fourth quarter of 2016 through the second quarter of 2017, re-contracting of available storage capacity throughout 2017 and the timing of working capital requirements.\nThe decrease in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 and the increase in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes a change of $276.8 million for the December 15, 2017 acquisition of the West Coast terminals.\nAdditional investments and expansion capital projects at our terminals have been approved that currently are, or will be, under construction with estimated completion dates that extend through the fourth quarter of 2019. At December 31, 2018, the remaining expenditures to complete the approved projects are estimated to be approximately $70 million. These expenditures primarily relate to the construction costs associated with our Collins, Phase II terminal expansion and our expansion of our Brownsville operations.\nOur Collins Phase II terminal expansion includes the construction of an additional approximately 870,000 barrels of new storage capacity and significant improvements to the Colonial Pipeline receipt and delivery manifolds. Total capital expenditures for this project are expected to be approximately $55 million. Approximately 870,000 barrels were placed into commercial service in the first quarter of 2019, with the manifold improvements to be placed into commercial service in the second quarter of 2019.\nOur expansion of our Brownsville operations includes the construction of approximately 630,000 barrels of additional liquids storage capacity and the conversion of our Diamondback Pipeline to transport diesel and gasoline to the U.S./Mexico border. We expect the first tanks of the additional liquids storage capacity under construction to be placed into commercial service during the first quarter of 2019. We expect to recommission the Diamondback Pipeline and resume operations on both the 8\u201d pipeline and the previously idle 6\u201d pipeline by the end of 2019, with the remaining additional liquids storage capacity being placed into commercial service at the same time. The anticipated aggregate cost of the terminal expansion and pipeline recommissioning is estimated to be approximately $55 million.\nNet cash used by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 and net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 changed primarily a result of funding the $276.8 million December 15, 2017 acquisition of the West Coast terminals.\nThird amended and restated senior secured credit facility. On March 13, 2017, we entered into the third amended and restated senior secured revolving credit facility, or our revolving credit facility,\u201d which provided for a maximum borrowing line of credit equal to $600 million. On December 14, 2017 we amended our revolving credit facility, which increased the maximum borrowing line of credit to $850 million, in connection with the acquisition of the West Coast terminals. At our request, the maximum borrowing line of credit may be increased by an additional $250 million, subject to the approval of the administrative agent and the receipt of additional commitments from one or more lenders. The terms of our revolving credit facility include covenants that restrict our ability to make cash distributions, acquisitions and investments, including investments in joint ventures. We may make distributions of cash to the extent of our available cash\u201d as defined in our LLC agreement. We may make acquisitions and investments that meet the definition of permitted acquisitions\u201d; other investments\u201d which may not exceed 5% of consolidated net tangible assets\u201d; and additional future permitted JV investments\u201d up to $175 million, which may include additional investments in BOSTCO. The principal balance of loans and any accrued and unpaid interest are due and payable in full on the maturity date, March 13, 2022.\nWe may elect to have loans under our revolving credit facility bear interest either (i) at a rate of LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.75% to 2.75% depending on the total leverage ratio then in effect, or (ii) at the base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.75% to 1.75% depending on the total leverage ratio then in effect. We also pay a commitment fee on the unused amount of commitments, ranging from 0.375% to 0.5% per annum, depending on the total leverage ratio then in effect. Our obligations under our revolving credit facility are secured by a first priority security interest in favor of the lenders in the majority of our assets, including our investments in unconsolidated affiliates. At December 31, 2018, our outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility were $306 million.\nOur revolving credit facility also contains customary representations and warranties (including those relating to organization and authorization, compliance with laws, absence of defaults, material agreements and litigation) and\n\t\t\ncustomary events of default (including those relating to monetary defaults, covenant defaults, cross defaults and bankruptcy events). The primary financial covenants contained in our revolving credit facility are (i) a total leverage ratio test (not to exceed 5.25 to 1.0), (ii) a senior secured leverage ratio test (not to exceed 3.75 to 1.0), and (iii) a minimum interest coverage ratio test (not less than 3.0 to 1.0; however while any Qualified Senior Notes are outstanding not less than 2.75 to 1.0). These financial covenants are based on a non-GAAP, defined financial performance measure within our revolving credit facility known as Consolidated EBITDA.\u201d As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under our revolving credit facility.\nIf we were to fail either financial performance covenant, or any other covenant contained in our revolving credit facility, we would seek a waiver from our lenders under such facility. If we were unable to obtain a waiver from our lenders and the default remained uncured after any applicable grace period, we would be in breach of our revolving credit facility, and the lenders would be entitled to declare all outstanding borrowings immediately due and payable.\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

On September 2, 2016, the SEC declared effective a universal shelf registration statement, which replaced our prior shelf registration statement that previously expired. Prior to the Take-Private Transaction, the shelf registration statement allowed us to issue common units and debt securities. In February 2018, we used the shelf registration statement to issue senior notes (see Note 21 of Notes to consolidated financial statements). In connection with the Take-Private Transaction, the Company prepared and filed a post-effective amendment to its Form S-3 registration statement in effect to deregister all securities of the Partnership unissued but issuable thereunder. The senior notes remain outstanding and the Company is voluntarily filing pursuant to the covenants contained in the senior notes.\nContractual obligations and contingencies.

    "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a refined petroleum products terminaling and pipeline transportation company formed in February 2005 as a Delaware limited partnership. Following the consummation of our Take-Private Transaction, we are wholly owned by TLP Finance Holdings, LLC, an indirect controlled subsidiary of ArcLight, and we have converted into a Delaware limited liability company pursuant to Section 17-219 of the Delaware Limited Partnership Act. Prior to the consummation of our Take-Private Transaction, we were controlled by our general partner, which was controlled by ArcLight.\nWe provide integrated terminaling, storage, transportation and related services for customers engaged in the distribution and marketing of light refined petroleum products, heavy refined petroleum products, crude oil, chemicals, fertilizers and other liquid products. Light refined products include gasolines, diesel fuels, heating oil and jet fuels. Heavy refined products include residual fuel oils and asphalt.\nWe do not take ownership of or market products that we handle or transport and, therefore, we are not directly exposed to changes in commodity prices, except for the value of product gains and losses arising from certain of our terminaling services agreements with our customers. The volume of product that is handled, transported through or stored in our terminals and pipelines is directly affected by the level of supply and demand in the wholesale markets served by our terminals and pipelines. Overall supply of refined products in the wholesale markets is influenced by the products' absolute prices, the availability of capacity on delivering pipelines and vessels, fluctuating refinery margins and the markets' perception of future product prices. The demand for gasoline typically peaks during the summer driving season, which extends from April to September, and declines during the fall and winter months. The demand for marine fuels typically peaks in the winter months due to the increase in the number of cruise ships originating from the Florida ports. Despite these seasonalities, the overall impact on the volume of product throughput in our terminals and pipelines is not material.\nNATURE OF ASSETS\nGulf Coast Operations. Our Gulf Coast terminals consist of eight refined product terminals and is the largest terminal network in Florida. These terminals have approximately 6.9 million barrels of aggregate active storage capacity in ports including Port Everglades, Miami and Cape Canaveral, which are among the busiest cruise ship ports in the nation. At our Gulf Coast terminals, we handle refined products and crude oil on behalf of, and provide integrated terminaling services to, customers engaged in the distribution and marketing of refined products and crude oil.\nMidwest Terminals and Pipeline Operations. In Missouri and Arkansas, we own and operate the Razorback pipeline and terminals in Mount Vernon, Missouri, at the origin of the pipeline and in Rogers, Arkansas, at the terminus of the pipeline. We refer to these two terminals collectively as the Razorback terminals. The Razorback pipeline is a 67-mile, 8-inch diameter interstate common carrier pipeline that transports light refined product from our terminal at Mount Vernon, where it is interconnected with a pipeline system owned by a third party, to our terminal at Rogers. The Razorback pipeline has a capacity of approximately 30,000 barrels per day. The razorback terminals have approximately\n\t\t\n0.4 million barrels of aggregate active storage capacity. Our Rogers facility is the only refined products terminal located in Northwest Arkansas.\nWe also own and operate a terminal facility in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma with approximately 0.2 million barrels of aggregate active storage capacity. Our Oklahoma City terminal receives gasolines and diesel fuels from a pipeline system owned by a third party for delivery via our truck rack for redistribution to locations throughout the Oklahoma City region.\nWe leased a portion of land in Cushing, Oklahoma and constructed storage tanks and associated infrastructure on the property for the receipt of crude oil by truck and pipeline, the blending of crude oil and the storage of approximately 1.0 million barrels of crude oil.\nBrownsville, Texas Operations. We own and operate a refined product terminal with approximately 0.8 million barrels of aggregate active storage capacity and related ancillary facilities in Brownsville independent of the Frontera joint venture, as well as the Diamondback pipeline which handles liquid product movements between south Texas and Mexico. At our Brownsville terminal we handle refined petroleum products, chemicals, vegetable oils, naphtha, wax and propane on behalf of, and provide integrated terminaling services to, customers engaged in the distribution and marketing of refined products and natural gas liquids.\nThe Diamondback pipeline consists of an 8\u201d pipeline that previously transported propane approximately 16 miles from our Brownsville facilities to the United States/Mexico border and a 6\u201d pipeline, which runs parallel to the 8\u201d pipeline that can be used by us in the future to transport additional refined products to Matamoros, Mexico. The 8\u201d pipeline has a capacity of approximately 20,000 barrels per day. The 6\u201d pipeline has a capacity of approximately 12,000 barrels per day. Operations on the Diamondback pipeline were shut down in the fourth quarter of 2017; however, we expect to recommission the Diamondback pipeline and resume operations by the end of 2019.\nIn 2018 and prior thereto, we also operated and maintained the United States portion of a 174-mile refined products pipeline owned by a third party. This pipeline connects our Brownsville terminal complex to a pipeline in Mexico that delivers to a third party terminal located in Reynosa, Mexico and terminates at the third party's refinery, located in Cadereyta, Nuevo Leon, Mexico, a suburb of the large industrial city of Monterrey. Our services for this pipeline terminated on August 23, 2018, and a third party has taken operatorship of the pipeline.\nRiver Operations. Our River terminals are composed of 12 refined product terminals located along the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers with approximately 2.7 million barrels of aggregate active storage capacity. Our River operations also include a dock facility in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, which is the only direct waterborne connection between the Colonial pipeline and Mississippi River waterborne transportation. At our River terminals, we handle gasolines, diesel fuels, heating oil, chemicals and fertilizers on behalf of, and provide integrated terminaling services to, customers engaged in the distribution and marketing of refined products and industrial and commercial end-users.\nSoutheast Operations. Our Southeast terminals consist of 22 refined product terminals located along the Colonial and Plantation pipelines in Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia with an aggregate active storage capacity of approximately 12.0 million barrels. At our Southeast terminals, we handle gasolines, diesel fuels, ethanol, biodiesel, jet fuel and heating oil on behalf of, and provide integrated terminaling services to, customers engaged in the distribution and marketing of refined products. Our Southeast terminals primarily receive products from the Plantation and Colonial pipelines on behalf of our customers and distribute products primarily to trucks with the exception of the Collins bulk storage terminal. The Collins terminal, currently going through expansions, is the only independent terminal capable of storing and redelivering product to, from and between the Colonial and Plantation pipelines.\nWest Coast Operations. Our West Coast terminals consist of two refined product terminals with approximately 5.3 million barrels of aggregate active storage capacity. The terminals are strategically located in close proximity to three San Francisco Bay refineries and the origin of the North California products pipeline distribution system. At our West Coast terminals, we handle crude oil, gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, gasoline blend stocks, fuel oil, Avgas and ethanol on behalf of, and provide integrated terminaling services to, customers engaged in the distribution and marketing of refined products. We acquired the West Coast terminals in December 2017.\n\t\t\nInvestment in Frontera. On April 1, 2011, we contributed approximately 1.5 million barrels of light petroleum product storage capacity, as well as related ancillary facilities, to the Frontera joint venture, in exchange for a cash payment of approximately $25.6 million and a 50% ownership interest in the Frontera joint venture. An affiliate of PEMEX, Mexico's state owned petroleum company, acquired the remaining 50% ownership interest in Frontera for a cash payment of approximately $25.6 million. We operate the Frontera assets under an operations and reimbursement agreement between us and Frontera. Frontera has approximately 1.7 million barrels of aggregate active storage capacity. Our 50% ownership interest does not allow us to control Frontera, but does allow us to exercise significant influence over its operations. Accordingly, we account for our investment in Frontera under the equity method of accounting.\nInvestment in BOSTCO. On December 20, 2012, we acquired a 42.5% Class A ownership interest in BOSTCO from Kinder Morgan Battleground Oil, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Kinder Morgan. BOSTCO is a terminal facility on the Houston Ship Channel designed to handle residual fuel, feedstocks, distillates and other black oils. BOSTCO has approximately 7.1 million barrels of aggregate active storage capacity. Our investment in BOSTCO entitles us to appoint a member to the Board of Managers of BOSTCO, to vote our proportionate ownership share on general governance matters and to certain rights of approval over significant changes in, or expansion of, BOSTCO's business. Kinder Morgan is responsible for managing BOSTCO's day-to-day operations. Our 42.5% Class A ownership interest does not allow us to control BOSTCO, but does allow us to exercise significant influence over its operations. Accordingly, we account for our investment in BOSTCO under the equity method of accounting.\nNATURE OF REVENUE AND EXPENSES\nWe derive revenue from our terminal and pipeline transportation operations by charging fees for providing integrated terminaling, transportation and related services. We have several significant customer relationships that made up 85% of the total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. These relationships include: NGL Energy Partners LP, Castleton Commodities International LLC, RaceTrac Petroleum Inc., Glencore Ltd., Tesoro, Musket Corporation, BP, Associated Asphalt, Magellan Pipeline Company, L.P., United States Government, Valero Marketing and Supply Company, PMI Trading Ltd., Exxon Mobil Oil Corporation, World Fuel Services Corporation, Chevron Corporation, Shell and Andeavor.\nThe fees we charge, our other sources of revenue and our direct costs and expenses are described below.\nTerminaling services fees. Our terminaling services agreements are structured as either throughput agreements or storage agreements. Our throughput agreements contain provisions that require our customers to make minimum payments, which are based on contractually established minimum volume of throughput of the customer's product at our facilities over a stipulated period of time. Due to this minimum payment arrangement, we recognize a fixed amount of revenue from the customer over a certain period of time, even if the customer throughputs less than the minimum volume of product during that period. In addition, if a customer throughputs a volume of product exceeding the minimum volume, we would recognize additional revenue on this incremental volume. Our storage agreements require our customers to make minimum payments based on the volume of storage capacity available to the customer under the agreement, which results in a fixed amount of recognized revenue. We refer to the fixed amount of revenue recognized pursuant to our terminaling services agreements as being firm commitments.\u201d Revenue recognized in excess of firm commitments and revenue recognized based solely on the volume of product distributed or injected are referred to as ancillary.\u201d In addition, ancillary\u201d revenue also includes fees received from ancillary services including heating and mixing of stored products, product transfer, railcar handling, butane blending, proceeds from the sale of product gains, wharfage and vapor recovery.\nPipeline transportation fees. We earn pipeline transportation fees at our Diamondback pipeline either based on the volume of product transported or under capacity reservation agreements. Revenue associated with the capacity reservation is recognized ratably over the respective term, regardless of whether the capacity is actually utilized. We earn pipeline transportation fees at our Razorback pipeline based on an allocation of the aggregate fees charged under the capacity agreement with our customer who has contracted for 100% of our Razorback system.\nManagement fees and reimbursed costs. We manage and operate certain tank capacity at our Port Everglades South terminal for a major oil company and receive a reimbursement of its proportionate share of operating and maintenance costs. We manage and operate the Frontera joint venture and receive a management fee based on our costs\n\t\t\nincurred. We manage and operate rail sites at certain Southeast terminals on behalf of a major oil company and receive reimbursement for operating and maintenance costs We lease land under operating leases and thereafter receive a fee as the lessor or sublessor from third parties and, in certain cases, our affiliates. We also managed and operated for an affiliate of PEMEX, Mexico's state-owned petroleum company, a products pipeline connected to our Brownsville terminal facility and received a management fee through August 23, 2018.\nDirect operating costs and expenses. The direct operating costs and expenses of our operations include the directly related wages and employee benefits, utilities, communications, maintenance and repairs, property taxes, rent, vehicle expenses, environmental compliance costs, materials and supplies needed to operate our terminals and pipelines.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses include direct general and administrative expenses for costs and expenses of employees performing engineering, health, safety and environmental services, third party accounting costs associated with annual and quarterly reports and tax return and Schedule K-1 preparation and distribution, legal fees and independent director fees. General and administrative expenses also include fees paid to ArcLight under the omnibus agreement to cover the costs of centralized corporate functions such as legal, accounting, treasury, insurance administration and claims processing, information technology, human resources, credit, payroll, taxes and other corporate services.\nInsurance expenses. Insurance expenses include charges for insurance premiums to cover costs of insuring activities such as property, casualty, pollution, automobile, directors' and officers' liability, and other insurable risks.\nSIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS SINCE THE FILING OF OUR PRIOR YEAR FORM 10-K\nTAKE-PRIVATE TRANSACTION\nOn February 26, 2019, an affiliate of ArcLight completed its previously announced acquisition of all of the Partnership's outstanding publicly traded common units not already held by ArcLight and its affiliates by way of our merger (the Merger\u201d) with a wholly owned subsidiary of TLP Finance Holdings, LLC ( TLP Finance\u201d), an indirect controlled subsidiary of Arclight. At the effective time of the Merger, each of the Partnership's general partner units issued and outstanding immediately prior to the acquisition effective time was converted into (i)(a) one Partnership common unit, and (i)(b) in aggregate, a non-economic general partner interest in the Partnership, (ii) each of the Partnership's incentive distribution rights issued and outstanding immediately prior to the acquisition effective time was converted into 100 Partnership common units, (iii) our general partner distributed its common units in the Partnership (the Transferred GP Units\u201d) to TLP Acquisition Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( TLP Holdings\u201d), and TLP Holdings contributed the Transferred GP Units to TLP Finance, (iv) the Partnership converted into the Company (a Delaware limited liability company) pursuant to Section 17-219 of the Delaware Limited Partnership Act and changed its name to TransMontaigne Partners LLC\u201d, and all of our common units owned by TLP Finance were converted into limited liability company interests, (v) the non-economic interest in the Company owned by our general partner was automatically cancelled and ceased to exist and our general partner merged with and into the Company with the Company surviving, and (vi) the Company became 100% owned by TLP Finance (the transactions described in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv), collectively with the Merger, the Take-Private Transaction\u201d).\nAs a result of the Take-Private Transaction, our common units ceased to be publicly traded, and our common units are no longer listed on the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE\u201d). Our currently outstanding 6.125% senior unsecured notes due in 2026 remain outstanding, and the Company is voluntarily filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the covenants contained in those notes.\nEXPANSION OF ASSETS\nExpansion of our Brownsville operations. The Frontera joint venture has waived its right of first refusal to participate in our previously announced Brownsville terminal expansion. Accordingly, our Brownsville expansion project will be 100% constructed and owned by the Company. The project, which is underpinned by new long-term agreements, includes the construction of approximately 630,000 barrels of additional liquids storage capacity and the conversion of our Diamondback Pipeline to transport diesel and gasoline to the U.S./Mexico border. The Diamondback\n\t\t\nPipeline is comprised of an 8\u201d pipeline that previously transported propane approximately 16 miles from our Brownsville facilities to the U.S./Mexico border, as well as a 6\u201d pipeline, which runs parallel to the 8\u201d pipeline, that has been idle and can be used to transport additional refined products. We expect the first tanks of the additional liquids storage capacity under construction to be placed into commercial service during the first quarter of 2019. We expect to recommission the Diamondback Pipeline and resume operations on both the 8\u201d pipeline and the previously idle 6\u201d pipeline by the end of 2019, with the remaining additional liquids storage capacity being placed into commercial service at the same time. The anticipated aggregate cost of the terminal expansion and pipeline recommissioning is estimated to be approximately $55 million.\nExpansion of our Collins terminal. Our Collins, Mississippi terminal complex is strategically located for the bulk storage market and is the only independent terminal capable of receiving from, delivering to, and transferring refined petroleum products between the Colonial and Plantation pipeline systems. We continue to implement the design and construction of approximately 870,000 barrels of new storage capacity supported by the execution of a new long-term, fee-based terminaling services agreement with a third party customer, which constitutes the beginning of a Phase II buildout. To facilitate our further expansion of tankage at our Collins terminal, we also entered into an agreement with Colonial Pipeline Company for significant improvements to the Colonial Pipeline receipt and delivery manifolds and our related receipt and delivery facilities. The improvements will result in significant increased flexibility for our Collins terminal customers including the simultaneous receipt and delivery of gasoline from and to Colonial's Line 1 at full line rates including the ability to receive and deliver segregated batches at these rates; a dedicated and segregated line for the receipt and delivery of distillates from and to Colonial's Line 2; and a dedicated and segregated line for the receipt and delivery of jet fuel from and to Colonial's Line 2. The anticipated cost of the approximately 870,000 barrels of new storage capacity and our share of the improvements to the pipeline connections is approximately $55 million, with expected annual cash returns in the low-teens. We are currently in active discussions with several other existing and prospective customers regarding additional future capacity at our Collins terminal. We expect the first of the new tanks to come online in the first quarter of 2019 and the Colonial Pipeline Company improvements to come online in the second quarter of 2019.\nExpansion of our West Coast terminals. On December 15, 2017, we acquired the West Coast terminals from a third party for a total purchase price of approximately $276.8 million. The West Coast terminals consist of two waterborne refined product and crude oil terminals located in the San Francisco Bay Area refining complex with a total of 64 storage tanks with approximately 5.3 million barrels of active storage capacity. The West Coast terminals have access to domestic and international crude oil and refined products markets through marine, pipeline, truck and rail logistics capabilities.\nPursuant to a new long-term terminaling services agreement, we have begun the construction of an additional 125,000 barrels of storage capacity at our Richmond West Coast terminal. The cost of constructing this new capacity is expected to be approximately $8 million. We are also pursuing other high-return investment opportunities similar to this at these terminals. The first of the new tanks began to come online in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nA summary of the significant accounting policies that we have adopted and followed in the preparation of our historical consolidated financial statements is detailed in Note 1 of Notes to consolidated financial statements. Certain of these accounting policies require the use of estimates. The following estimates, in management's opinion, are subjective in nature, require the exercise of judgment and involve complex analyses: useful lives of our plant and equipment, accrued environmental obligations and business combination estimates and assumptions. These estimates are based on our knowledge and understanding of current conditions and actions we may take in the future. Changes in these estimates will occur as a result of the passage of time and the occurrence of future events. Subsequent changes in these estimates may have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations (see Note 1 of Notes to consolidated financial statements).\nUseful lives of plant and equipment. We calculate depreciation using the straight-line method, based on estimated useful lives of our assets. These estimates are based on various factors including age (in the case of acquired assets), manufacturing specifications, technological advances and historical data concerning useful lives of similar\n\t\t\nassets. Uncertainties that impact these estimates include changes in laws and regulations relating to restoration, economic conditions and supply and demand in the area. When assets are put into service, we make estimates with respect to useful lives that we believe to be reasonable. However, subsequent events could cause us to change our estimates, thus impacting the future calculation of depreciation. Estimated useful lives are 15 to 25 years for terminals and pipelines and 3 to 25 years for furniture, fixtures and equipment.\nAccrued environmental obligations. At December 31, 2018, we have an accrued liability of approximately $1.6 million representing our best estimate of the undiscounted future payments we expect to pay for environmental costs to remediate existing conditions. Estimates of our environmental obligations are subject to change due to a number of factors and judgments involved in the estimation process, including the early stage of investigation at certain sites, the lengthy time frames required to complete remediation, technology changes affecting remediation methods, alternative remediation methods and strategies and changes in environmental laws and regulations. Changes in our estimates and assumptions may occur as a result of the passage of time and the occurrence of future events.\nCosts incurred to remediate existing contamination at the terminals have been, and are expected in the future to be, insignificant. Pursuant to agreements, an affiliate of NGL Energy Partners LP retained certain liabilities and indemnified us against certain potential environmental claims, losses and expenses associated with the operation of the acquired terminal facilities and occurring before our date of acquisition, up to a maximum liability for these indemnification obligations (not to exceed $15.0 million for the Florida and Midwest terminals acquired on May 27, 2005, not to exceed $15.0 million for the Brownsville and River facilities acquired on December 31, 2006, not to exceed $15.0 million for the Southeast terminals acquired on December 31, 2007 and not to exceed $2.5 million for the Pensacola terminal acquired on March 1, 2011). The forgoing environmental indemnifications to us remain in place and were not affected by the Take-Private Transaction.\nBusiness combination estimates and assumptions. The application of business combination and impairment accounting requires us to use significant estimates and assumptions in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities. The acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed to allocate the proper amount of the purchase price consideration between goodwill and the assets that are depreciated and amortized. We record intangible assets separately from goodwill and amortize intangible assets with finite lives over their estimated useful life as determined by management. We do not amortize goodwill but instead periodically assess goodwill for impairment.\nFor all material acquisitions, we engage the services of an independent appraiser to assist us in determining the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities, including goodwill; however, the ultimate determination of those values is the responsibility of our management. We base our estimates on assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain. These valuations require the use of management's assumptions, which would not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur.\n\t\t\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS-YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, 2017 AND 2016\nANALYSIS OF REVENUE\nTotal revenue.

Our terminaling services agreements are structured as either throughput agreements or storage agreements. Our throughput agreements contain provisions that require our customers to make minimum payments, which are based on contractually established minimum volume of throughput of the customer's product at our facilities over a stipulated period of time. Due to this minimum payment arrangement, we recognize a fixed amount of revenue from the customer over a certain period of time, even if the customer throughputs less than the minimum volume of product during that period. In addition, if a customer throughputs a volume of product exceeding the minimum volume, we would recognize additional revenue on this incremental volume. Our storage agreements require our customers to make minimum payments based on the volume of storage capacity available to the customer under the agreement, which results in a fixed amount of recognized revenue.\nWe refer to the fixed amount of revenue recognized pursuant to our terminaling services agreements as being firm commitments.\u201d Revenue recognized in excess of firm commitments and revenue recognized based solely on the volume of product distributed or injected are referred to as ancillary.\u201d In addition ancillary\u201d revenue also includes fees\n\t\t\nreceived from ancillary services including heating and mixing of stored products, product transfer, railcar handling, butane blending, proceeds from the sale of product gains, wharfage and vapor recovery.\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTerminaling Services Fees\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nby Business Segment\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGulf Coast terminals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n64,338\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n61,889\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n54,619\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMidwest terminals and pipeline system\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9,469\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBrownsville terminals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11,202\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRiver terminals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10,868\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSoutheast terminals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n82,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n75,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n58,410\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWest Coast terminals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n39,952\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,738\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTerminaling services fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n216,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n168,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n144,568\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in terminaling services fees at our Gulf Coast terminals for the year ended December 31, 2018 results from an increase in ancillary revenue.

<td>\n68,415\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in direct operating costs and expenses at our Brownsville terminals for the year ended December 31, 2018 is primarily attributable to terminating our lease of the Ella-Brownsville pipeline from a third party on December 31, 2017 in connection with the expansion of our Brownville operations.\nThe increase in direct operating costs and expenses at our Southeast terminals is a result of the completion of our Phase I Collins terminal expansion project in various stages beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016 through the second quarter of 2017.\nThe increase in direct operating costs and expenses at our West Coast terminals is a result of the West Coast terminals acquisition on December 15, 2017.\nGeneral and administrative expenses include fees paid to ArcLight under the omnibus agreement to cover the costs of centralized corporate functions such as legal, accounting, treasury, insurance administration and claims processing, information technology, human resources, credit, payroll, taxes and other corporate services. General and administrative expenses also include direct general and administrative expenses for costs and expenses of employees performing engineering, health, safety and environmental services, third party accounting costs associated with annual and quarterly reports and tax return and Schedule K-1 preparation and distribution, legal fees and independent director\n\t\t\nfees. The general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were approximately $21.6 million, $19.4 million and $14.1 million, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 is primarily attributable to an increase in the omnibus fee beginning May 13, 2018 and costs associated with the Take-Private Transaction. The increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 is primarily attributable to the May 3, 2017 increase in the omnibus fee and costs for pursuing acquisition and other growth opportunities.\nInsurance expenses include charges for insurance premiums to cover costs of insuring activities such as property, casualty, pollution, automobile, directors' and officers' liability, and other insurable risks. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the insurance expense was approximately $5.0 million, $4.1 million and $4.1 million, respectively. The increase in insurance expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 is primarily attributable to the December 15, 2017 West Coast acquisition.\nEquity-based compensation expense includes expense associated with us reimbursing ArcLight for awards granted by them to certain key officers and employees who provide service to us that vest over future service periods and, prior to the consummation of the Take-Private Transaction, grants to the independent directors of our general partner under our long-term incentive plan (which was terminated, in relevant part, in connection with the Take-Private Transaction). Prior to the consummation of the Take-Private Transaction, we had the intent and ability to settle our reimbursement for the bonus awards by issuing additional common units, and accordingly, we accounted for the bonus awards as an equity award; following the Take-Private Transaction, we will settle our awards through cash compensation. The expenses associated with these reimbursements were approximately $3.5 million, $3.0 million and $3.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were approximately $49.5 million, $36.0 million and $32.4 million, respectively. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is primarily attributable to placing the Collins expansion project in service in various stages beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016 through the second quarter of 2017 and the December 15, 2017 West Coast acquisition.\nInterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was approximately $31.9 million, $10.5 million and $7.8 million, respectively. The increase in interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is primarily attributable to financing the December 15, 2017 acquisition of the West Coast terminals, the February 12, 2018 issuance of senior notes and increases in LIBOR based interest rates.\nANALYSIS OF INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES\nAt December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our investments in unconsolidated affiliates include a 42.5% Class A ownership interest in BOSTCO and a 50% ownership interest in Frontera. BOSTCO is a terminal facility located on the Houston Ship Channel that encompasses approximately 7.1 million barrels of distillate, residual and other black oil product storage. Class A and Class B ownership interests share in cash distributions on a 96.5% and 3.5% basis, respectively.

The increase in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 is primarily attributable to increased revenue related to placing 2.0 million barrels of new tank capacity at our Collins terminal into service in various stages\n\t\t\nbeginning in the fourth quarter of 2016 through the second quarter of 2017, re-contracting of available storage capacity throughout 2017 and the timing of working capital requirements.\nThe decrease in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 and the increase in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes a change of $276.8 million for the December 15, 2017 acquisition of the West Coast terminals.\nAdditional investments and expansion capital projects at our terminals have been approved that currently are, or will be, under construction with estimated completion dates that extend through the fourth quarter of 2019. At December 31, 2018, the remaining expenditures to complete the approved projects are estimated to be approximately $70 million. These expenditures primarily relate to the construction costs associated with our Collins, Phase II terminal expansion and our expansion of our Brownsville operations.\nOur Collins Phase II terminal expansion includes the construction of an additional approximately 870,000 barrels of new storage capacity and significant improvements to the Colonial Pipeline receipt and delivery manifolds. Total capital expenditures for this project are expected to be approximately $55 million. Approximately 870,000 barrels were placed into commercial service in the first quarter of 2019, with the manifold improvements to be placed into commercial service in the second quarter of 2019.\nOur expansion of our Brownsville operations includes the construction of approximately 630,000 barrels of additional liquids storage capacity and the conversion of our Diamondback Pipeline to transport diesel and gasoline to the U.S./Mexico border. We expect the first tanks of the additional liquids storage capacity under construction to be placed into commercial service during the first quarter of 2019. We expect to recommission the Diamondback Pipeline and resume operations on both the 8\u201d pipeline and the previously idle 6\u201d pipeline by the end of 2019, with the remaining additional liquids storage capacity being placed into commercial service at the same time. The anticipated aggregate cost of the terminal expansion and pipeline recommissioning is estimated to be approximately $55 million.\nNet cash used by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 and net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 changed primarily a result of funding the $276.8 million December 15, 2017 acquisition of the West Coast terminals.\nThird amended and restated senior secured credit facility. On March 13, 2017, we entered into the third amended and restated senior secured revolving credit facility, or our revolving credit facility,\u201d which provided for a maximum borrowing line of credit equal to $600 million. On December 14, 2017 we amended our revolving credit facility, which increased the maximum borrowing line of credit to $850 million, in connection with the acquisition of the West Coast terminals. At our request, the maximum borrowing line of credit may be increased by an additional $250 million, subject to the approval of the administrative agent and the receipt of additional commitments from one or more lenders. The terms of our revolving credit facility include covenants that restrict our ability to make cash distributions, acquisitions and investments, including investments in joint ventures. We may make distributions of cash to the extent of our available cash\u201d as defined in our LLC agreement. We may make acquisitions and investments that meet the definition of permitted acquisitions\u201d; other investments\u201d which may not exceed 5% of consolidated net tangible assets\u201d; and additional future permitted JV investments\u201d up to $175 million, which may include additional investments in BOSTCO. The principal balance of loans and any accrued and unpaid interest are due and payable in full on the maturity date, March 13, 2022.\nWe may elect to have loans under our revolving credit facility bear interest either (i) at a rate of LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.75% to 2.75% depending on the total leverage ratio then in effect, or (ii) at the base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.75% to 1.75% depending on the total leverage ratio then in effect. We also pay a commitment fee on the unused amount of commitments, ranging from 0.375% to 0.5% per annum, depending on the total leverage ratio then in effect. Our obligations under our revolving credit facility are secured by a first priority security interest in favor of the lenders in the majority of our assets, including our investments in unconsolidated affiliates. At December 31, 2018, our outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility were $306 million.\nOur revolving credit facility also contains customary representations and warranties (including those relating to organization and authorization, compliance with laws, absence of defaults, material agreements and litigation) and\n\t\t\ncustomary events of default (including those relating to monetary defaults, covenant defaults, cross defaults and bankruptcy events). The primary financial covenants contained in our revolving credit facility are (i) a total leverage ratio test (not to exceed 5.25 to 1.0), (ii) a senior secured leverage ratio test (not to exceed 3.75 to 1.0), and (iii) a minimum interest coverage ratio test (not less than 3.0 to 1.0; however while any Qualified Senior Notes are outstanding not less than 2.75 to 1.0). These financial covenants are based on a non-GAAP, defined financial performance measure within our revolving credit facility known as Consolidated EBITDA.\u201d As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under our revolving credit facility.\nIf we were to fail either financial performance covenant, or any other covenant contained in our revolving credit facility, we would seek a waiver from our lenders under such facility. If we were unable to obtain a waiver from our lenders and the default remained uncured after any applicable grace period, we would be in breach of our revolving credit facility, and the lenders would be entitled to declare all outstanding borrowings immediately due and payable.\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

On September 2, 2016, the SEC declared effective a universal shelf registration statement, which replaced our prior shelf registration statement that previously expired. Prior to the Take-Private Transaction, the shelf registration statement allowed us to issue common units and debt securities. In February 2018, we used the shelf registration statement to issue senior notes (see Note 21 of Notes to consolidated financial statements). In connection with the Take-Private Transaction, the Company prepared and filed a post-effective amendment to its Form S-3 registration statement in effect to deregister all securities of the Partnership unissued but issuable thereunder. The senior notes remain outstanding and the Company is voluntarily filing pursuant to the covenants contained in the senior notes.\nContractual obligations and contingencies. We have contractual obligations that are required to be settled in cash.

    "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a refined petroleum products terminaling and pipeline transportation company formed in February 2005 as a Delaware limited partnership. Following the consummation of our Take-Private Transaction, we are wholly owned by TLP Finance Holdings, LLC, an indirect controlled subsidiary of ArcLight, and we have converted into a Delaware limited liability company pursuant to Section 17-219 of the Delaware Limited Partnership Act. Prior to the consummation of our Take-Private Transaction, we were controlled by our general partner, which was controlled by ArcLight.\nWe provide integrated terminaling, storage, transportation and related services for customers engaged in the distribution and marketing of light refined petroleum products, heavy refined petroleum products, crude oil, chemicals, fertilizers and other liquid products. Light refined products include gasolines, diesel fuels, heating oil and jet fuels. Heavy refined products include residual fuel oils and asphalt.\nWe do not take ownership of or market products that we handle or transport and, therefore, we are not directly exposed to changes in commodity prices, except for the value of product gains and losses arising from certain of our terminaling services agreements with our customers. The volume of product that is handled, transported through or stored in our terminals and pipelines is directly affected by the level of supply and demand in the wholesale markets served by our terminals and pipelines. Overall supply of refined products in the wholesale markets is influenced by the products' absolute prices, the availability of capacity on delivering pipelines and vessels, fluctuating refinery margins and the markets' perception of future product prices. The demand for gasoline typically peaks during the summer driving season, which extends from April to September, and declines during the fall and winter months. The demand for marine fuels typically peaks in the winter months due to the increase in the number of cruise ships originating from the Florida ports. Despite these seasonalities, the overall impact on the volume of product throughput in our terminals and pipelines is not material.\nNATURE OF ASSETS\nGulf Coast Operations. Our Gulf Coast terminals consist of eight refined product terminals and is the largest terminal network in Florida. These terminals have approximately 6.9 million barrels of aggregate active storage capacity in ports including Port Everglades, Miami and Cape Canaveral, which are among the busiest cruise ship ports in the nation. At our Gulf Coast terminals, we handle refined products and crude oil on behalf of, and provide integrated terminaling services to, customers engaged in the distribution and marketing of refined products and crude oil.\nMidwest Terminals and Pipeline Operations. In Missouri and Arkansas, we own and operate the Razorback pipeline and terminals in Mount Vernon, Missouri, at the origin of the pipeline and in Rogers, Arkansas, at the terminus of the pipeline. We refer to these two terminals collectively as the Razorback terminals. The Razorback pipeline is a 67-mile, 8-inch diameter interstate common carrier pipeline that transports light refined product from our terminal at Mount Vernon, where it is interconnected with a pipeline system owned by a third party, to our terminal at Rogers. The Razorback pipeline has a capacity of approximately 30,000 barrels per day. The razorback terminals have approximately\n\t\t\n0.4 million barrels of aggregate active storage capacity. Our Rogers facility is the only refined products terminal located in Northwest Arkansas.\nWe also own and operate a terminal facility in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma with approximately 0.2 million barrels of aggregate active storage capacity. Our Oklahoma City terminal receives gasolines and diesel fuels from a pipeline system owned by a third party for delivery via our truck rack for redistribution to locations throughout the Oklahoma City region.\nWe leased a portion of land in Cushing, Oklahoma and constructed storage tanks and associated infrastructure on the property for the receipt of crude oil by truck and pipeline, the blending of crude oil and the storage of approximately 1.0 million barrels of crude oil.\nBrownsville, Texas Operations. We own and operate a refined product terminal with approximately 0.8 million barrels of aggregate active storage capacity and related ancillary facilities in Brownsville independent of the Frontera joint venture, as well as the Diamondback pipeline which handles liquid product movements between south Texas and Mexico. At our Brownsville terminal we handle refined petroleum products, chemicals, vegetable oils, naphtha, wax and propane on behalf of, and provide integrated terminaling services to, customers engaged in the distribution and marketing of refined products and natural gas liquids.\nThe Diamondback pipeline consists of an 8\u201d pipeline that previously transported propane approximately 16 miles from our Brownsville facilities to the United States/Mexico border and a 6\u201d pipeline, which runs parallel to the 8\u201d pipeline that can be used by us in the future to transport additional refined products to Matamoros, Mexico. The 8\u201d pipeline has a capacity of approximately 20,000 barrels per day. The 6\u201d pipeline has a capacity of approximately 12,000 barrels per day. Operations on the Diamondback pipeline were shut down in the fourth quarter of 2017; however, we expect to recommission the Diamondback pipeline and resume operations by the end of 2019.\nIn 2018 and prior thereto, we also operated and maintained the United States portion of a 174-mile refined products pipeline owned by a third party. This pipeline connects our Brownsville terminal complex to a pipeline in Mexico that delivers to a third party terminal located in Reynosa, Mexico and terminates at the third party's refinery, located in Cadereyta, Nuevo Leon, Mexico, a suburb of the large industrial city of Monterrey. Our services for this pipeline terminated on August 23, 2018, and a third party has taken operatorship of the pipeline.\nRiver Operations. Our River terminals are composed of 12 refined product terminals located along the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers with approximately 2.7 million barrels of aggregate active storage capacity. Our River operations also include a dock facility in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, which is the only direct waterborne connection between the Colonial pipeline and Mississippi River waterborne transportation. At our River terminals, we handle gasolines, diesel fuels, heating oil, chemicals and fertilizers on behalf of, and provide integrated terminaling services to, customers engaged in the distribution and marketing of refined products and industrial and commercial end-users.\nSoutheast Operations. Our Southeast terminals consist of 22 refined product terminals located along the Colonial and Plantation pipelines in Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia with an aggregate active storage capacity of approximately 12.0 million barrels. At our Southeast terminals, we handle gasolines, diesel fuels, ethanol, biodiesel, jet fuel and heating oil on behalf of, and provide integrated terminaling services to, customers engaged in the distribution and marketing of refined products. Our Southeast terminals primarily receive products from the Plantation and Colonial pipelines on behalf of our customers and distribute products primarily to trucks with the exception of the Collins bulk storage terminal. The Collins terminal, currently going through expansions, is the only independent terminal capable of storing and redelivering product to, from and between the Colonial and Plantation pipelines.\nWest Coast Operations. Our West Coast terminals consist of two refined product terminals with approximately 5.3 million barrels of aggregate active storage capacity. The terminals are strategically located in close proximity to three San Francisco Bay refineries and the origin of the North California products pipeline distribution system. At our West Coast terminals, we handle crude oil, gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, gasoline blend stocks, fuel oil, Avgas and ethanol on behalf of, and provide integrated terminaling services to, customers engaged in the distribution and marketing of refined products. We acquired the West Coast terminals in December 2017.\n\t\t\nInvestment in Frontera. On April 1, 2011, we contributed approximately 1.5 million barrels of light petroleum product storage capacity, as well as related ancillary facilities, to the Frontera joint venture, in exchange for a cash payment of approximately $25.6 million and a 50% ownership interest in the Frontera joint venture. An affiliate of PEMEX, Mexico's state owned petroleum company, acquired the remaining 50% ownership interest in Frontera for a cash payment of approximately $25.6 million. We operate the Frontera assets under an operations and reimbursement agreement between us and Frontera. Frontera has approximately 1.7 million barrels of aggregate active storage capacity. Our 50% ownership interest does not allow us to control Frontera, but does allow us to exercise significant influence over its operations. Accordingly, we account for our investment in Frontera under the equity method of accounting.\nInvestment in BOSTCO. On December 20, 2012, we acquired a 42.5% Class A ownership interest in BOSTCO from Kinder Morgan Battleground Oil, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Kinder Morgan. BOSTCO is a terminal facility on the Houston Ship Channel designed to handle residual fuel, feedstocks, distillates and other black oils. BOSTCO has approximately 7.1 million barrels of aggregate active storage capacity. Our investment in BOSTCO entitles us to appoint a member to the Board of Managers of BOSTCO, to vote our proportionate ownership share on general governance matters and to certain rights of approval over significant changes in, or expansion of, BOSTCO's business. Kinder Morgan is responsible for managing BOSTCO's day-to-day operations. Our 42.5% Class A ownership interest does not allow us to control BOSTCO, but does allow us to exercise significant influence over its operations. Accordingly, we account for our investment in BOSTCO under the equity method of accounting.\nNATURE OF REVENUE AND EXPENSES\nWe derive revenue from our terminal and pipeline transportation operations by charging fees for providing integrated terminaling, transportation and related services. We have several significant customer relationships that made up 85% of the total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. These relationships include: NGL Energy Partners LP, Castleton Commodities International LLC, RaceTrac Petroleum Inc., Glencore Ltd., Tesoro, Musket Corporation, BP, Associated Asphalt, Magellan Pipeline Company, L.P., United States Government, Valero Marketing and Supply Company, PMI Trading Ltd., Exxon Mobil Oil Corporation, World Fuel Services Corporation, Chevron Corporation, Shell and Andeavor.\nThe fees we charge, our other sources of revenue and our direct costs and expenses are described below.\nTerminaling services fees. Our terminaling services agreements are structured as either throughput agreements or storage agreements. Our throughput agreements contain provisions that require our customers to make minimum payments, which are based on contractually established minimum volume of throughput of the customer's product at our facilities over a stipulated period of time. Due to this minimum payment arrangement, we recognize a fixed amount of revenue from the customer over a certain period of time, even if the customer throughputs less than the minimum volume of product during that period. In addition, if a customer throughputs a volume of product exceeding the minimum volume, we would recognize additional revenue on this incremental volume. Our storage agreements require our customers to make minimum payments based on the volume of storage capacity available to the customer under the agreement, which results in a fixed amount of recognized revenue. We refer to the fixed amount of revenue recognized pursuant to our terminaling services agreements as being firm commitments.\u201d Revenue recognized in excess of firm commitments and revenue recognized based solely on the volume of product distributed or injected are referred to as ancillary.\u201d In addition, ancillary\u201d revenue also includes fees received from ancillary services including heating and mixing of stored products, product transfer, railcar handling, butane blending, proceeds from the sale of product gains, wharfage and vapor recovery.\nPipeline transportation fees. We earn pipeline transportation fees at our Diamondback pipeline either based on the volume of product transported or under capacity reservation agreements. Revenue associated with the capacity reservation is recognized ratably over the respective term, regardless of whether the capacity is actually utilized. We earn pipeline transportation fees at our Razorback pipeline based on an allocation of the aggregate fees charged under the capacity agreement with our customer who has contracted for 100% of our Razorback system.\nManagement fees and reimbursed costs. We manage and operate certain tank capacity at our Port Everglades South terminal for a major oil company and receive a reimbursement of its proportionate share of operating and maintenance costs. We manage and operate the Frontera joint venture and receive a management fee based on our costs\n\t\t\nincurred. We manage and operate rail sites at certain Southeast terminals on behalf of a major oil company and receive reimbursement for operating and maintenance costs We lease land under operating leases and thereafter receive a fee as the lessor or sublessor from third parties and, in certain cases, our affiliates. We also managed and operated for an affiliate of PEMEX, Mexico's state-owned petroleum company, a products pipeline connected to our Brownsville terminal facility and received a management fee through August 23, 2018.\nDirect operating costs and expenses. The direct operating costs and expenses of our operations include the directly related wages and employee benefits, utilities, communications, maintenance and repairs, property taxes, rent, vehicle expenses, environmental compliance costs, materials and supplies needed to operate our terminals and pipelines.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses include direct general and administrative expenses for costs and expenses of employees performing engineering, health, safety and environmental services, third party accounting costs associated with annual and quarterly reports and tax return and Schedule K-1 preparation and distribution, legal fees and independent director fees. General and administrative expenses also include fees paid to ArcLight under the omnibus agreement to cover the costs of centralized corporate functions such as legal, accounting, treasury, insurance administration and claims processing, information technology, human resources, credit, payroll, taxes and other corporate services.\nInsurance expenses. Insurance expenses include charges for insurance premiums to cover costs of insuring activities such as property, casualty, pollution, automobile, directors' and officers' liability, and other insurable risks.\nSIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS SINCE THE FILING OF OUR PRIOR YEAR FORM 10-K\nTAKE-PRIVATE TRANSACTION\nOn February 26, 2019, an affiliate of ArcLight completed its previously announced acquisition of all of the Partnership's outstanding publicly traded common units not already held by ArcLight and its affiliates by way of our merger (the Merger\u201d) with a wholly owned subsidiary of TLP Finance Holdings, LLC ( TLP Finance\u201d), an indirect controlled subsidiary of Arclight. At the effective time of the Merger, each of the Partnership's general partner units issued and outstanding immediately prior to the acquisition effective time was converted into (i)(a) one Partnership common unit, and (i)(b) in aggregate, a non-economic general partner interest in the Partnership, (ii) each of the Partnership's incentive distribution rights issued and outstanding immediately prior to the acquisition effective time was converted into 100 Partnership common units, (iii) our general partner distributed its common units in the Partnership (the Transferred GP Units\u201d) to TLP Acquisition Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( TLP Holdings\u201d), and TLP Holdings contributed the Transferred GP Units to TLP Finance, (iv) the Partnership converted into the Company (a Delaware limited liability company) pursuant to Section 17-219 of the Delaware Limited Partnership Act and changed its name to TransMontaigne Partners LLC\u201d, and all of our common units owned by TLP Finance were converted into limited liability company interests, (v) the non-economic interest in the Company owned by our general partner was automatically cancelled and ceased to exist and our general partner merged with and into the Company with the Company surviving, and (vi) the Company became 100% owned by TLP Finance (the transactions described in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv), collectively with the Merger, the Take-Private Transaction\u201d).\nAs a result of the Take-Private Transaction, our common units ceased to be publicly traded, and our common units are no longer listed on the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE\u201d). Our currently outstanding 6.125% senior unsecured notes due in 2026 remain outstanding, and the Company is voluntarily filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the covenants contained in those notes.\nEXPANSION OF ASSETS\nExpansion of our Brownsville operations. The Frontera joint venture has waived its right of first refusal to participate in our previously announced Brownsville terminal expansion. Accordingly, our Brownsville expansion project will be 100% constructed and owned by the Company. The project, which is underpinned by new long-term agreements, includes the construction of approximately 630,000 barrels of additional liquids storage capacity and the conversion of our Diamondback Pipeline to transport diesel and gasoline to the U.S./Mexico border. The Diamondback\n\t\t\nPipeline is comprised of an 8\u201d pipeline that previously transported propane approximately 16 miles from our Brownsville facilities to the U.S./Mexico border, as well as a 6\u201d pipeline, which runs parallel to the 8\u201d pipeline, that has been idle and can be used to transport additional refined products. We expect the first tanks of the additional liquids storage capacity under construction to be placed into commercial service during the first quarter of 2019. We expect to recommission the Diamondback Pipeline and resume operations on both the 8\u201d pipeline and the previously idle 6\u201d pipeline by the end of 2019, with the remaining additional liquids storage capacity being placed into commercial service at the same time. The anticipated aggregate cost of the terminal expansion and pipeline recommissioning is estimated to be approximately $55 million.\nExpansion of our Collins terminal. Our Collins, Mississippi terminal complex is strategically located for the bulk storage market and is the only independent terminal capable of receiving from, delivering to, and transferring refined petroleum products between the Colonial and Plantation pipeline systems. We continue to implement the design and construction of approximately 870,000 barrels of new storage capacity supported by the execution of a new long-term, fee-based terminaling services agreement with a third party customer, which constitutes the beginning of a Phase II buildout. To facilitate our further expansion of tankage at our Collins terminal, we also entered into an agreement with Colonial Pipeline Company for significant improvements to the Colonial Pipeline receipt and delivery manifolds and our related receipt and delivery facilities. The improvements will result in significant increased flexibility for our Collins terminal customers including the simultaneous receipt and delivery of gasoline from and to Colonial's Line 1 at full line rates including the ability to receive and deliver segregated batches at these rates; a dedicated and segregated line for the receipt and delivery of distillates from and to Colonial's Line 2; and a dedicated and segregated line for the receipt and delivery of jet fuel from and to Colonial's Line 2. The anticipated cost of the approximately 870,000 barrels of new storage capacity and our share of the improvements to the pipeline connections is approximately $55 million, with expected annual cash returns in the low-teens. We are currently in active discussions with several other existing and prospective customers regarding additional future capacity at our Collins terminal. We expect the first of the new tanks to come online in the first quarter of 2019 and the Colonial Pipeline Company improvements to come online in the second quarter of 2019.\nExpansion of our West Coast terminals. On December 15, 2017, we acquired the West Coast terminals from a third party for a total purchase price of approximately $276.8 million. The West Coast terminals consist of two waterborne refined product and crude oil terminals located in the San Francisco Bay Area refining complex with a total of 64 storage tanks with approximately 5.3 million barrels of active storage capacity. The West Coast terminals have access to domestic and international crude oil and refined products markets through marine, pipeline, truck and rail logistics capabilities.\nPursuant to a new long-term terminaling services agreement, we have begun the construction of an additional 125,000 barrels of storage capacity at our Richmond West Coast terminal. The cost of constructing this new capacity is expected to be approximately $8 million. We are also pursuing other high-return investment opportunities similar to this at these terminals. The first of the new tanks began to come online in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nA summary of the significant accounting policies that we have adopted and followed in the preparation of our historical consolidated financial statements is detailed in Note 1 of Notes to consolidated financial statements. Certain of these accounting policies require the use of estimates. The following estimates, in management's opinion, are subjective in nature, require the exercise of judgment and involve complex analyses: useful lives of our plant and equipment, accrued environmental obligations and business combination estimates and assumptions. These estimates are based on our knowledge and understanding of current conditions and actions we may take in the future. Changes in these estimates will occur as a result of the passage of time and the occurrence of future events. Subsequent changes in these estimates may have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations (see Note 1 of Notes to consolidated financial statements).\nUseful lives of plant and equipment. We calculate depreciation using the straight-line method, based on estimated useful lives of our assets. These estimates are based on various factors including age (in the case of acquired assets), manufacturing specifications, technological advances and historical data concerning useful lives of similar\n\t\t\nassets. Uncertainties that impact these estimates include changes in laws and regulations relating to restoration, economic conditions and supply and demand in the area. When assets are put into service, we make estimates with respect to useful lives that we believe to be reasonable. However, subsequent events could cause us to change our estimates, thus impacting the future calculation of depreciation. Estimated useful lives are 15 to 25 years for terminals and pipelines and 3 to 25 years for furniture, fixtures and equipment.\nAccrued environmental obligations. At December 31, 2018, we have an accrued liability of approximately $1.6 million representing our best estimate of the undiscounted future payments we expect to pay for environmental costs to remediate existing conditions. Estimates of our environmental obligations are subject to change due to a number of factors and judgments involved in the estimation process, including the early stage of investigation at certain sites, the lengthy time frames required to complete remediation, technology changes affecting remediation methods, alternative remediation methods and strategies and changes in environmental laws and regulations. Changes in our estimates and assumptions may occur as a result of the passage of time and the occurrence of future events.\nCosts incurred to remediate existing contamination at the terminals have been, and are expected in the future to be, insignificant. Pursuant to agreements, an affiliate of NGL Energy Partners LP retained certain liabilities and indemnified us against certain potential environmental claims, losses and expenses associated with the operation of the acquired terminal facilities and occurring before our date of acquisition, up to a maximum liability for these indemnification obligations (not to exceed $15.0 million for the Florida and Midwest terminals acquired on May 27, 2005, not to exceed $15.0 million for the Brownsville and River facilities acquired on December 31, 2006, not to exceed $15.0 million for the Southeast terminals acquired on December 31, 2007 and not to exceed $2.5 million for the Pensacola terminal acquired on March 1, 2011). The forgoing environmental indemnifications to us remain in place and were not affected by the Take-Private Transaction.\nBusiness combination estimates and assumptions. The application of business combination and impairment accounting requires us to use significant estimates and assumptions in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities. The acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed to allocate the proper amount of the purchase price consideration between goodwill and the assets that are depreciated and amortized. We record intangible assets separately from goodwill and amortize intangible assets with finite lives over their estimated useful life as determined by management. We do not amortize goodwill but instead periodically assess goodwill for impairment.\nFor all material acquisitions, we engage the services of an independent appraiser to assist us in determining the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities, including goodwill; however, the ultimate determination of those values is the responsibility of our management. We base our estimates on assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain. These valuations require the use of management's assumptions, which would not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur.\n\t\t\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS-YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, 2017 AND 2016\nANALYSIS OF REVENUE\nTotal revenue. We derive revenue from our terminal and pipeline transportation operations by charging fees for providing integrated terminaling, transportation and related services. Our total revenue by category was as follows (in thousands):\n\nSee discussion below for a detailed analysis of terminaling services fees, pipeline transportation fees, management fees and reimbursed costs and other revenue included in the table above.\nWe operate our business and report our results of operations in six principal business segments: (i) Gulf Coast terminals, (ii) Midwest terminals and pipeline system, (iii) Brownsville terminals, (iv) River terminals, (v) Southeast terminals and (vi) West Coast terminals. The aggregate revenue of each of our business segments was as follows (in thousands):\n\nTotal revenue by business segment is presented and further analyzed below by category of revenue.\nTerminaling services fees. Our terminaling services agreements are structured as either throughput agreements or storage agreements. Our throughput agreements contain provisions that require our customers to make minimum payments, which are based on contractually established minimum volume of throughput of the customer's product at our facilities over a stipulated period of time. Due to this minimum payment arrangement, we recognize a fixed amount of revenue from the customer over a certain period of time, even if the customer throughputs less than the minimum volume of product during that period. In addition, if a customer throughputs a volume of product exceeding the minimum volume, we would recognize additional revenue on this incremental volume. Our storage agreements require our customers to make minimum payments based on the volume of storage capacity available to the customer under the agreement, which results in a fixed amount of recognized revenue.\nWe refer to the fixed amount of revenue recognized pursuant to our terminaling services agreements as being firm commitments.\u201d Revenue recognized in excess of firm commitments and revenue recognized based solely on the volume of product distributed or injected are referred to as ancillary.\u201d In addition ancillary\u201d revenue also includes fees\n\t\t\nreceived from ancillary services including heating and mixing of stored products, product transfer, railcar handling, butane blending, proceeds from the sale of product gains, wharfage and vapor recovery.\n\nThe increase in terminaling services fees at our Gulf Coast terminals for the year ended December 31, 2018 results from an increase in ancillary revenue. The increase in terminaling services fees at our Gulf Coast terminals for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes an increase of approximately $1.4 million resulting from re-contracting capacity at Port Manatee, Florida in July 2016 and November 2016, an increase of approximately $1.4 million resulting from increased throughput by various customers and $0.7 million resulting from contracting refurbished capacity at Port Manatee and Jacksonville, Florida in May 2017.\nThe increase in terminaling services fees at our Southeast terminals for the year ended December 31, 2018 includes an increase of approximately $3.0 million resulting from placing into service approximately 2.0 million barrels of new tank capacity at our Collins terminal in various stages beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016 through the second quarter of 2017, and an increase in ancillary revenue.\nThe increase in terminaling services fees at our West Coast terminals for the year ended December 31, 2018 is a result of the West Coast terminals acquisition on December 15, 2017.\nIncluded in terminaling services fees for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 are fees charged to affiliates of approximately $11.0 million, $1.9 million and $3.4 million, respectively.\nThe firm commitments\u201d and ancillary\u201d revenue included in terminaling services fees were as follows (in thousands):\n\nThe remaining terms on the terminaling services agreements that generated firm commitments\u201d for the year ended December 31, 2018 were as follows (in thousands):\n\n_____________________________\n\t\t\n(1) We have a terminaling services agreement with a third party relating to our Southeast terminals that will continue in effect through February 1, 2023, after which it shall automatically continue unless and until the third party provides at least 24 months' prior notice of its intent to terminate the agreement. Effective at any time from and after July 31, 2040, we have the right to terminate the agreement by providing at least 24 months' prior notice of our intent to terminate the agreement. We do not believe the third party will terminate the agreement prior to July 31, 2040; therefore we have presented the firm commitments related to this terminaling services agreement in the 5 years or more remaining category in the table above.\nPipeline transportation fees. We earned pipeline transportation fees at our Diamondback pipeline either based on the volume of product transported or under capacity reservation agreements. Revenue associated with the capacity reservation is recognized ratably over the respective term, regardless of whether the capacity is actually utilized. We earn pipeline transportation fees at our Razorback pipeline based on an allocation of the aggregate fees charged under the capacity agreement with our customer who has contracted for 100% of our Razorback system. We own the Razorback and Diamondback pipelines, and we leased the Ella-Brownsville pipeline from a third party through December 31, 2017. The pipeline transportation fees by business segments were as follows (in thousands):\n\nThe decrease in pipeline transportation fees at our Brownsville terminals for the year ended December 31, 2018 is attributable to suspending operations on the Ella-Brownsville and Diamondback pipelines at the end of 2017 in connection with the expansion of our Brownville operations. The Diamondback Pipeline consists of an 8\u201d pipeline that previously transported propane approximately 16 miles from our Brownsville facilities to the U.S./Mexico border and a 6\u201d pipeline, which runs parallel to the 8\u201d pipeline that has been idle and can be used to transport additional refined products. We expect to recommission and resume operations on both the 8\u201d pipeline and the previously idle 6\u201d pipeline by the end of 2019.\nIncluded in pipeline transportation fees for each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 are fees charged to affiliates of approximately $nil.\n\t\t\nManagement fees and reimbursed costs. We manage and operate certain tank capacity at our Port Everglades South terminal for a major oil company and receive a reimbursement of its proportionate share of operating and maintenance costs. We manage and operate the Frontera joint venture and receive a management fee based on our costs incurred. We manage and operate rail sites at certain Southeast terminals on behalf of a major oil company and receive reimbursement for operating and maintenance costs. We lease land under operating leases and thereafter receive a fee as the lessor or sublessor from third parties and, in certain cases, our affiliates. We also managed and operated for an affiliate of PEMEX, Mexico's state-owned petroleum company, a products pipeline connected to our Brownsville terminal facility and received a management fee through August 23, 2018. The management fees and reimbursed costs by business segments were as follows (in thousands):\n\nIncluded in management fees and reimbursed costs for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 are fees charged to affiliates of approximately $5.8 million, $5.3 million and $5.0 million, respectively.\nOther revenue. Other revenue includes payments to us for settlement of litigation and reimbursements for property damage caused by customers. Other revenue by business segments were as follows (in thousands):\n\nIncluded in Other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 is an approximately $1.9 million one-time payment to us at our Brownsville terminals related to the settlement of litigation with our LPG customer, an approximately $1.7 million one-time payment to us at our River terminals related to property damage caused by a customer and an approximately $0.9 million one-time payment to us at our Gulf Coast terminals related to property damage caused by a customer.\nIncluded in other revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 are amounts charged to affiliates of approximately $nil.\n\t\t\nANALYSIS OF COSTS AND EXPENSES\nThe direct operating costs and expenses of our operations include the direct wages and employee benefits, utilities, communications, repairs and maintenance, rent, property taxes, vehicle expenses, environmental compliance costs, materials and supplies. Consistent with historical trends, repairs and maintenance expenses can vary year-to-year based on the timing of scheduled maintenance and unforeseen circumstances necessitating repairs to our terminals and pipelines. The direct operating costs and expenses of our operations were as follows (in thousands):\n\nThe direct operating costs and expenses of our business segments were as follows (in thousands):\n\nThe decrease in direct operating costs and expenses at our Brownsville terminals for the year ended December 31, 2018 is primarily attributable to terminating our lease of the Ella-Brownsville pipeline from a third party on December 31, 2017 in connection with the expansion of our Brownville operations.\nThe increase in direct operating costs and expenses at our Southeast terminals is a result of the completion of our Phase I Collins terminal expansion project in various stages beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016 through the second quarter of 2017.\nThe increase in direct operating costs and expenses at our West Coast terminals is a result of the West Coast terminals acquisition on December 15, 2017.\nGeneral and administrative expenses include fees paid to ArcLight under the omnibus agreement to cover the costs of centralized corporate functions such as legal, accounting, treasury, insurance administration and claims processing, information technology, human resources, credit, payroll, taxes and other corporate services. General and administrative expenses also include direct general and administrative expenses for costs and expenses of employees performing engineering, health, safety and environmental services, third party accounting costs associated with annual and quarterly reports and tax return and Schedule K-1 preparation and distribution, legal fees and independent director\n\t\t\nfees. The general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were approximately $21.6 million, $19.4 million and $14.1 million, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 is primarily attributable to an increase in the omnibus fee beginning May 13, 2018 and costs associated with the Take-Private Transaction. The increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 is primarily attributable to the May 3, 2017 increase in the omnibus fee and costs for pursuing acquisition and other growth opportunities.\nInsurance expenses include charges for insurance premiums to cover costs of insuring activities such as property, casualty, pollution, automobile, directors' and officers' liability, and other insurable risks. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the insurance expense was approximately $5.0 million, $4.1 million and $4.1 million, respectively. The increase in insurance expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 is primarily attributable to the December 15, 2017 West Coast acquisition.\nEquity-based compensation expense includes expense associated with us reimbursing ArcLight for awards granted by them to certain key officers and employees who provide service to us that vest over future service periods and, prior to the consummation of the Take-Private Transaction, grants to the independent directors of our general partner under our long-term incentive plan (which was terminated, in relevant part, in connection with the Take-Private Transaction). Prior to the consummation of the Take-Private Transaction, we had the intent and ability to settle our reimbursement for the bonus awards by issuing additional common units, and accordingly, we accounted for the bonus awards as an equity award; following the Take-Private Transaction, we will settle our awards through cash compensation. The expenses associated with these reimbursements were approximately $3.5 million, $3.0 million and $3.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were approximately $49.5 million, $36.0 million and $32.4 million, respectively. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is primarily attributable to placing the Collins expansion project in service in various stages beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016 through the second quarter of 2017 and the December 15, 2017 West Coast acquisition.\nInterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was approximately $31.9 million, $10.5 million and $7.8 million, respectively. The increase in interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is primarily attributable to financing the December 15, 2017 acquisition of the West Coast terminals, the February 12, 2018 issuance of senior notes and increases in LIBOR based interest rates.\nANALYSIS OF INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES\nAt December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our investments in unconsolidated affiliates include a 42.5% Class A ownership interest in BOSTCO and a 50% ownership interest in Frontera. BOSTCO is a terminal facility located on the Houston Ship Channel that encompasses approximately 7.1 million barrels of distillate, residual and other black oil product storage. Class A and Class B ownership interests share in cash distributions on a 96.5% and 3.5% basis, respectively. Class B ownership interests do not have voting rights and are not required to make capital investments. Frontera is a terminal facility located in Brownsville, Texas that encompasses approximately 1.7 million barrels of light petroleum product storage, as well as related ancillary facilities.\nThe following table summarizes our investments in unconsolidated affiliates:\n\n\t\t\nEarnings from investments in unconsolidated affiliates were as follows (in thousands):\n\nThe decrease in earnings from our investment in BOSTCO for the year ended December 31, 2017 is primarily attributable to increased dredging costs and the terminal being offline revenue for a few days due to Hurricane Harvey. There was no damage to the terminal as a result of Hurricane Harvey.\nAdditional capital investments in unconsolidated affiliates were as follows (in thousands):\n\nCash distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates were as follows (in thousands):\n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur primary liquidity needs are to fund our working capital requirements, distributions to equity owners, approved investments, approved capital projects and approved future expansion, development and acquisition opportunities. We expect to fund any investments, capital projects and future expansion, development and acquisition opportunities with cash flows from operations and additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities were as follows (in thousands):\n\nThe increase in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 is primarily attributable to increased revenue related to the acquisition of the West Coast terminals in December 2017. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 is primarily attributable to increased revenue related to placing 2.0 million barrels of new tank capacity at our Collins terminal into service in various stages\n\t\t\nbeginning in the fourth quarter of 2016 through the second quarter of 2017, re-contracting of available storage capacity throughout 2017 and the timing of working capital requirements.\nThe decrease in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 and the increase in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes a change of $276.8 million for the December 15, 2017 acquisition of the West Coast terminals.\nAdditional investments and expansion capital projects at our terminals have been approved that currently are, or will be, under construction with estimated completion dates that extend through the fourth quarter of 2019. At December 31, 2018, the remaining expenditures to complete the approved projects are estimated to be approximately $70 million. These expenditures primarily relate to the construction costs associated with our Collins, Phase II terminal expansion and our expansion of our Brownsville operations.\nOur Collins Phase II terminal expansion includes the construction of an additional approximately 870,000 barrels of new storage capacity and significant improvements to the Colonial Pipeline receipt and delivery manifolds. Total capital expenditures for this project are expected to be approximately $55 million. Approximately 870,000 barrels were placed into commercial service in the first quarter of 2019, with the manifold improvements to be placed into commercial service in the second quarter of 2019.\nOur expansion of our Brownsville operations includes the construction of approximately 630,000 barrels of additional liquids storage capacity and the conversion of our Diamondback Pipeline to transport diesel and gasoline to the U.S./Mexico border. We expect the first tanks of the additional liquids storage capacity under construction to be placed into commercial service during the first quarter of 2019. We expect to recommission the Diamondback Pipeline and resume operations on both the 8\u201d pipeline and the previously idle 6\u201d pipeline by the end of 2019, with the remaining additional liquids storage capacity being placed into commercial service at the same time. The anticipated aggregate cost of the terminal expansion and pipeline recommissioning is estimated to be approximately $55 million.\nNet cash used by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 and net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 changed primarily a result of funding the $276.8 million December 15, 2017 acquisition of the West Coast terminals.\nThird amended and restated senior secured credit facility. On March 13, 2017, we entered into the third amended and restated senior secured revolving credit facility, or our revolving credit facility,\u201d which provided for a maximum borrowing line of credit equal to $600 million. On December 14, 2017 we amended our revolving credit facility, which increased the maximum borrowing line of credit to $850 million, in connection with the acquisition of the West Coast terminals. At our request, the maximum borrowing line of credit may be increased by an additional $250 million, subject to the approval of the administrative agent and the receipt of additional commitments from one or more lenders. The terms of our revolving credit facility include covenants that restrict our ability to make cash distributions, acquisitions and investments, including investments in joint ventures. We may make distributions of cash to the extent of our available cash\u201d as defined in our LLC agreement. We may make acquisitions and investments that meet the definition of permitted acquisitions\u201d; other investments\u201d which may not exceed 5% of consolidated net tangible assets\u201d; and additional future permitted JV investments\u201d up to $175 million, which may include additional investments in BOSTCO. The principal balance of loans and any accrued and unpaid interest are due and payable in full on the maturity date, March 13, 2022.\nWe may elect to have loans under our revolving credit facility bear interest either (i) at a rate of LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.75% to 2.75% depending on the total leverage ratio then in effect, or (ii) at the base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.75% to 1.75% depending on the total leverage ratio then in effect. We also pay a commitment fee on the unused amount of commitments, ranging from 0.375% to 0.5% per annum, depending on the total leverage ratio then in effect. Our obligations under our revolving credit facility are secured by a first priority security interest in favor of the lenders in the majority of our assets, including our investments in unconsolidated affiliates. At December 31, 2018, our outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility were $306 million.\nOur revolving credit facility also contains customary representations and warranties (including those relating to organization and authorization, compliance with laws, absence of defaults, material agreements and litigation) and\n\t\t\ncustomary events of default (including those relating to monetary defaults, covenant defaults, cross defaults and bankruptcy events). The primary financial covenants contained in our revolving credit facility are (i) a total leverage ratio test (not to exceed 5.25 to 1.0), (ii) a senior secured leverage ratio test (not to exceed 3.75 to 1.0), and (iii) a minimum interest coverage ratio test (not less than 3.0 to 1.0; however while any Qualified Senior Notes are outstanding not less than 2.75 to 1.0). These financial covenants are based on a non-GAAP, defined financial performance measure within our revolving credit facility known as Consolidated EBITDA.\u201d As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under our revolving credit facility.\nIf we were to fail either financial performance covenant, or any other covenant contained in our revolving credit facility, we would seek a waiver from our lenders under such facility. If we were unable to obtain a waiver from our lenders and the default remained uncured after any applicable grace period, we would be in breach of our revolving credit facility, and the lenders would be entitled to declare all outstanding borrowings immediately due and payable.\n\n___________________________________\n (1) Reflects the calculation of Consolidated EBITDA and Consolidated interest expense in accordance with the definition for such financial metrics in our revolving credit facility. \n (2) Reflects percentage of completion pro forma credit related to the Collins Phase II terminal expansion and the Brownsville terminal expansion that qualify as a Material Project\u201d under the terms of our revolving credit facility. \n (3) Consolidated interest expense, used in the calculation of the interest coverage ratio, excludes unrealized gains and losses recognized on our derivative instruments. \n\t\t\nTermination of shelf registration. On September 2, 2016, the SEC declared effective a universal shelf registration statement, which replaced our prior shelf registration statement that previously expired. Prior to the Take-Private Transaction, the shelf registration statement allowed us to issue common units and debt securities. In February 2018, we used the shelf registration statement to issue senior notes (see Note 21 of Notes to consolidated financial statements). In connection with the Take-Private Transaction, the Company prepared and filed a post-effective amendment to its Form S-3 registration statement in effect to deregister all securities of the Partnership unissued but issuable thereunder. The senior notes remain outstanding and the Company is voluntarily filing pursuant to the covenants contained in the senior notes.\nContractual obligations and contingencies. We have contractual obligations that are required to be settled in cash. The amounts of our contractual obligations at December 31, 2018 are as follows (in thousands):\n\n (1) Assumes that our outstanding revolving credit facility debt at December 31, 2018 remains outstanding until its maturity date and we incur interest expense at the weighted average interest rate on our borrowings outstanding for the three months ended December 31, 2018, which is 5.75% per year. \n (2) Assumes that senior notes at December 31, 2018 remain outstanding until their maturity date and we incur interest expense at the coupon rate of 6.125%. \nWe believe that our future cash expected to be provided by operating activities, available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, and our relationship with institutional lenders should enable us to meet our committed capital and our essential liquidity requirements for the next twelve months.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect or change on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. The term off-balance sheet arrangement\u201d generally means any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with us is a party, under which we have (i) any obligation arising under a guarantee contract, derivative instrument or variable interest; or (ii) a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support for such assets.",

    "summary": "The provided segment is from the Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) section of an Annual Report, focusing on a company that engages in terminaling and pipeline transportation of refined petroleum products and other liquids. The company was formed in February 2005, converted into a Delaware limited liability company after a \"Take-Private Transaction,\" and is wholly owned by TLP Finance Holdings, LLC, under the indirect control of ArcLight. Their services include handling and storage without taking ownership of the commodities, thereby not being directly exposed to commodity price fluctuations.\n\nThey operate in several geographical segments with numerous terminals and pipeline systems. The Gulf Coast, Midwest, Brownsville (Texas), River, Southeast, and West Coast operations are described, along with their capacities and services. The company also has investments in the Frontera joint venture and BOSTCO, which they account for using the equity method.\n\nRevenue arises from terminaling and pipeline transportation fees, with significant customer relationships contributing to 85% of the total revenue. They provide fixed minimum payment arrangements with customers, resulting in steady income. Management fees and reimbursed costs from managing assets and operations for third parties form another source of revenue.\n\nOperating expenses, general and administrative expenses, insurance expenses, and interest expenses are addressed, with explanations for variability and the impacts of recent acquisitions and expansions. The company remains compliant with covenants under their secured credit facility, and they have no off-balance sheet arrangements that would materially affect their financial condition.\n\nKey financial figures for recent years (not specified) include total revenues rising from $164,924,000 to $183,272,000, and then $228,093,000. Major developments include the \"Take-Private Transaction,\" the expansion of assets, the acquisition of West Coast terminals, and the impact of critical accounting policies and estimates on reported finances. The report details the financial performance covenant tests and reconciliations of Consolidated EBITDA to cash flows provided by operating activities.\n\nLastly, the company outlines its liquidity and capital resources, expecting to fund investments and projects from cash flows and additional borrowings. Their revolving credit facility is discussed, with its terms, conditions, and financial covenants. They also enumerate their contractual obligations, such as the additions to property and equipment, operating leases, revolving credit facility debt, and interest expenses.\n\nNote: Specific values, dates, and other figures should be checked against the source report, as the summary may not include all specific details due to its condensed nature."
