Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe statements in this discussion regarding the industry outlook and our expectations regarding the future performance of our business and the other non-historical statements are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described in Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Part I-Item 1A - \"Risk Factors.\" You should read the following discussion together with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Part II-Item 8 - \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nOverview\nOn December 31, 2015, CIFC Corp. entered into a series of transactions (the \"Reorganization Transaction\") to become a subsidiary of CIFC LLC, a publicly traded limited liability company. CIFC LLC (together with its subsidiaries, \"CIFC,\" we\u201d or \"us\") is a Delaware limited liability company headquartered in New York City. We are a private debt manager specializing in secured U.S. corporate loan strategies. Our primary business is to provide investment management services for institutional investors, including pension funds, hedge funds, asset management firms, banks, insurance companies and other types of investors around the world.\nFee Earning Assets Under Management ( Fee Earning AUM\u201d or AUM\u201d) refers to principal balance, net asset value or value of assets managed by us on which we earn management and/or incentive fees. Our AUM is primarily comprised of Collateralized Loan Obligations (\"CLOs\"). In addition, we manage credit funds and other loan-based products (together, \"Non-CLO products\" and together with CLOs, \"Funds\"). We manage these credit products through opportunistic investment strategies where we seek to generate current income and/or capital appreciation, primarily through senior secured corporate loan investments ( SSCLs\u201d) and, to a lesser extent, other investments. We also manage Collateralized Debt Obligations ( CDOs\u201d), which we do not expect to issue in the future.\nWe have three primary sources of revenue: management fees, incentive fees and investment income. Management fees are generally based on a percentage of AUM of the Funds. Incentive fees are earned based on the performance of the Funds. Investment income represents interest income and realized/unrealized gains and losses on investments in the products sponsored by us and third parties.\nAs of December 31, 2015, DFR Holdings LLC (\"DFR Holdings\") owned approximately 74% of the Company's outstanding shares (approximately 70% on a fully diluted basis).\nRecent Developments\nReorganization Transaction\nOn December 31, 2015, CIFC completed a series of transactions to change our top-level form of organization from a corporation to a limited liability company that is taxed as a partnership rather than a corporation for U.S. Federal income tax purposes and allows us to minimize entity-level taxation on investment income. These tax efficiencies may enable us to increase distributions to shareholders and/or investment in our business. As part of the Reorganization Transaction, CIFC Corp. distributed ownership of certain of its subsidiary entities holding certain investment assets to CIFC LLC and retained non-voting Series A Preferred Units (\"Preferred Units\") issued by certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of CIFC LLC (see Related Party Transactions below).\nEach share of common stock of CIFC Corp. outstanding immediately prior to the Reorganization Transaction was converted into the right to receive one common share representing a limited liability company interest in CIFC LLC. Further, CIFC LLC assumed all obligations under the CIFC Corp. 2011 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the \"Stock Incentive Plan\"). All the terms and conditions that were in effect immediately prior to the Reorganization Transaction under each outstanding equity award assumed by CIFC LLC will continue in full force and effect after the Reorganization Transaction, except that the interests issuable under each such award will be common shares of CIFC LLC instead of common stock of CIFC Corp.\nCIFC Corp. remains the issuer and primary obligor of our Junior Subordinated Notes and the Senior Notes (see below). Further, CIFC LLC and certain other subsidiaries of CIFC LLC have provided full and unconditional guarantees of the obligations of CIFC Corp. under the Junior Subordinated Notes and the Senior Notes.\nExecutive Overview\nThe past year proved to be the most challenging for the leveraged credit market since the end of the financial crisis. Commodity prices came under pressure over the summer and risk assets sold off starting in August. The U.S. High Yield Market was down 5% and the U.S. Corporate Loan market recorded its first negative total return since 2008.\nOur balance sheet investments in CIFC-managed funds outperformed their respective benchmarks. Both the Senior Secured Corporate Loan Fund and the Tactical Income Fund produced positive returns vis-\u00e0-vis losses in both the CS Loan Index and the LSTA Loan Index. The pronounced weakness in the CLO market led to a decline in mark-to-market valuation of our balance sheet CLO investments. Consequently, net investment income dropped to $1.9 million compared with $14.1 million in 2014. Excluding investment income, we increased ENI EBITDA by $7.2 million or 26% year-over-year.\nIn 2015, we were successful in sponsoring 5 new CLOs for a combined AUM of $2.6 billion. Strong equity sponsorship allowed us to issue all 5 transactions on a non-risk retention compliant basis. We are well capitalized to issue risk retention compliant CLOs. We successfully completed a 10-year $40 million senior unsecured bond offering in the fourth quarter to further bolster our capacity to invest in risk retention compliant CLOs. We have $210.4 million of cash and investments on our balance sheet, most of which will be available for risk retention compliance over the next 3 years.\nOur total return corporate credit loan business has outperformed the various leveraged loan indices (S&P LSTA, CS LL & JPM LL) since inception, for three consecutive years. We successfully launched three new funds; including our first white-labeled loan funds in Korea and Switzerland. The AUM of our credit fund platform now exceeds $1.0 billion. Our loan portfolios continue to perform well and defaults continue to be substantially lower compared to the loan indices. We have maintained our rigorous underwriting process and actively managed risk across well-diversified portfolios. We first started to cut our energy exposure in late August and early September of 2014 and continue to be defensively positioned. We remain underweight the sector with current exposure below 3%.\nCLO issuance has been slow during the course of the first two months of 2016. Forecasts from various banks expect market conditions to improve in the second half of the year. We are well positioned to access the market once conditions become more compelling. Loan prepayment rates have slowed significantly. We expect loan prepayment rates to remain lower until CLO new issuance volumes return, increasing the duration of our existing CLO AUM. We are taking advantage of lower loan prices to build par in our 2.0 CLOs. We expect the current investment opportunity to drive improved returns and with that, potentially higher incentive fees on our existing CLOs in the future.\nFee Earning AUM\nFee Earning AUM or AUM refers to the assets managed by the Company on which we receive management fees and/or incentive fees. Generally, with respect to CLOs, management fees are paid to the Company based on the aggregate collateral balance at par plus principal cash, and with respect to Non-CLO funds, the value of the assets in such funds. The following table summarizes Fee Earning AUM:\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands, except # of Accounts) (1)(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Number of Accounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fee Earning AUM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Number of Accounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fee Earning AUM\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Post 2011 CLOs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,860,519\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,402,986\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Legacy CLOs (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,559,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,960,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total CLOs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,419,585\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,363,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit Funds (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,062,712\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>593,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Loan-Based Products (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>573,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>719,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Non-CLOs (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,635,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,312,626\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Loan-Based AUM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,055,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,676,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ABS and Corporate Bond CDOs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>592,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>687,555\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Fee Earning AUM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,648,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,364,044\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nExplanatory Notes:\n_________________________________\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Fee Earning AUM attributable to ABS and Corporate Bond CDO products is expected to continue to decline as these funds run-off per their contractual terms.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 37: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Fee Earning AUM is based on the latest available monthly report issued by the trustee or fund administrator prior to the end of the period, and may not tie back to the Consolidated GAAP financial statements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 38: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>Legacy CLOs represent all managed CLOs issued prior to 2011, including CLOs acquired since 2011 but issued prior to 2011.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 39: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(4)\n</td> <td>Management fees for Non-CLO products vary by fund and may not be similar to a CLO.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFee Earning AUM activities are as follows:\nTable 40: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total loan-based AUM -

All CDOs and certain CLOs we manage have passed their reinvestment periods (see table below). Therefore, proceeds from paydowns are required to repay the CLO's or CDO's liabilities. As expected, AUM on these CLOs and CDOs continued to decline during the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition, 9 CLOs were called during 2015, which generated additional incentive fees. This, along with redemptions from other loan-based products, reduced AUM by $2.7 billion, resulting in an overall net increase in AUM of $0.3 billion.\nLoan-based AUM\nSince 2012, CIFC has raised $11.4 billion of new AUM through organic growth, which has more than offset the run-off from Legacy CLOs (including acquired CLOs). Our Legacy CLO AUM of $2.6 billion is less than a fifth of our total CLO AUM of $12.4 billion and we anticipate it will run off over the next three years.\nThe structure of the CLOs we manage affects the management fees paid to us.

Consolidated VIEs includes certain CLOs and warehouses we manage.\nIn February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standard Update \"ASU\" 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810) - Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis (\"ASU 2015-02\"). The amendments changed the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. We elected to early adopt this guidance on a modified retroactive basis (as of January 1, 2015) (\"Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\"-Note 3). The adoption of ASU 2015-02 resulted in the deconsolidation of 30 CLOs and the Senior Secured Corporate Loan Fund on a modified retrospective basis on January 1, 2015. As of December 31, 2015 the Company consolidated 2 CLOs and 2 credit funds.

unconsolidated CLOs, CDOs and Non-CLO products and net investment income from investments in unconsolidated entities. Year-over-year total net revenues decreased significantly due to the deconsolidation of 30 CLOs and the Senior Secured Corporate Loan Fund as of January 1, 2015. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2015-02, revenues from these assets were eliminated in consolidation.\nTotal Expenses\nEmployee compensation and benefits-The increase primarily relates to contractual fee sharing arrangements which required the Company to pay certain former employees incentive fees collected on CLOs acquired from Columbus Nova Credit Investments Management, LLC (\"CNCIM\"). During 2015, we received higher incentive fees on such CLOs. The increase was partially offset by a reduction in incentive-based compensation compared to the prior year.\nShare based compensation-During 2015, we expensed a full year of amortization on 1.3 million of RSUs and 0.4 million of stock options granted during 2014. In addition, in 2015, we recognized additional expenses from the acceleration of vesting terms on certain restricted stock unit awards granted to the Company's Co-Presidents (\"Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\"-Note 12).\nProfessional fees-Year over year, professional fees increased primarily in relation to expenses incurred for the Reorganization Transaction and to support the growth and diversification of the business.\nGeneral and administrative expenses-In 2014, we recorded a $0.6 million expense for the settlement of litigation with a former employee.\nDepreciation and amortization-In 2015, we had lower amortization expense for intangible assets since these management contracts were either impaired or written off in the prior year.\nImpairments of intangible assets-During the year ended December 31, 2015, we received notice from holders of certain CLOs exercising their right to call those CLOs for redemption. As a result of these calls, we recorded impairment charges of $1.8 million to fully impair intangible assets associated with these management contracts.\nConsolidated Entities - Expenses and Interest Expenses-Year-over-year total expenses from the Consolidated Entities decreased significantly primarily due to the deconsolidation of 30 CLOs and the Senior Secured Corporate Loan Fund as of January 1, 2015. As of December 31, 2015 the Company consolidated 2 CLOs and 2 credit funds and as of December 31, 2014, we consolidated 31 CLOs, 1 warehouse, and 2 credit funds. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2015-02, expenses from these entities were eliminated in consolidation.\nNet other income (expense) and gain (loss)-Subsequent to the adoption of ASU 2015-02, we deconsolidated 30 CLOs and the Senior Secured Corporate Loan Fund on a modified retrospective basis on January 1, 2015. As such, the balances are not comparable year over year.\nNet gain (loss) on investment-Net gain (loss) on investment includes the unrealized appreciation or depreciation and realized gains and losses on the investments in CLOs, warehouses and credit funds which we are not required to consolidate. In general, the decrease primarily related to an increase in unrealized losses as a result of significant declines in the market value of loans and CLO securities compared to the prior year. See Non-GAAP Measures section for further discussion.\nNet (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in Consolidated Entities-Subsequent to the adoption of ASU 2015-02, we deconsolidated 30 CLOs and the Senior Secured Corporate Loan Fund on a modified retrospective basis on January 1, 2015. As such, the balances are not comparable year over year. As of December 31, 2015, we consolidated 2 CLOs and 2 credit funds, and as of December 31, 2014, we consolidated 31 CLOs, 1 warehouse, and 2 credit funds.\nIncome tax expense/benefit-CIFC's Provision for Taxes for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $25.2 million and $22.2 million, respectively. This resulted in an effective tax rate of 96.3% and 225.3%, respectively, based on our Income (loss) before income taxes of $26.2 million and $9.8 million, respectively.\nThe primary factor that contributed to the fluctuation in the effective tax rate is that pre-tax book income (loss) includes $0.6 million for 2015 and $(20.7) million for 2014 of income/(loss) from consolidated VIEs and VOEs. Income/(loss) from consolidated VIEs and VOEs is included in the pre-tax income/(loss) but is not included in the calculation of taxable income. The effective tax rate in 2015 and 2014 was impacted by the write-down of deferred tax assets of $6.3 million and $6.4 million, respectively, resulting from tax law changes enacted by New York City in 2015 and New York State in 2014. These tax law changes were effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015. The 2015 effective tax rate was further impacted by the reversal of the deferred tax assets in connection with the Reorganization Transaction (see \"Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\"-Note 15).\nWe expect a reduction in our effective tax rate going forward as the result of the Reorganization Transaction. Inclusion of consolidated VIEs and VOEs in the pretax income/(loss) is expected to continue to impact the effective tax rate for future years.\nENI and Deconsolidated Non-GAAP Statements (Non-GAAP Measures)\nENI and ENI EBITDA\nENI is a non-GAAP financial measure of profitability which management uses in addition to GAAP Net income (loss) attributable to CIFC LLC to measure the performance of our core business (excluding non-core products). We believe ENI reflects the nature and substance of the business, the economic results driven by management and incentive fee revenues from the management of client funds and earnings on our investments. ENI represents GAAP Net income (loss) attributable to CIFC LLC excluding (i) income taxes, (ii) merger and acquisition related items including fee-sharing arrangements, amortization and impairments of intangible assets and gain (loss) on contingent consideration for earn-outs, (iii) non-cash compensation related to profits interests granted by CIFC Parent Holdings LLC (\"CIFC Parent\") in June 2011, (iv) revenues attributable to non-core investment products, (v) advances for fund organizational expenses, and (vi) certain other items as detailed.\nENI EBITDA is also a non-GAAP financial measure that management considers, in addition to GAAP Net income (loss) attributable to CIFC LLC, to evaluate our core performance. ENI EBITDA represents ENI before corporate interest expense and depreciation of fixed assets, a non-cash item.\nENI and ENI EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies, as they are non-GAAP financial measures that are not based on a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and therefore may be defined differently by other companies. In addition, ENI and ENI EBITDA should be considered an addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table presents our components of ENI for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (1):\nTable 46: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands, except per share amounts)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Fees from CLOs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,709\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subordinated Fees from CLOs\n</td> <td>34,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management Fees from Non-CLO products\n</td> <td>3,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,705\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total management Fees\n</td> <td>62,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Incentive Fees\n</td> <td>22,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income (2)\n</td> <td>1,866\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,273\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(87)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total adjusted net revenues\n</td> <td>86,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88,811\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,356\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employee compensation and benefits\n</td> <td>26,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,308\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(406\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Share-based compensation\n</td> <td>5,348\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,579\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional services\n</td> <td>7,846\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>587\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>9,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(255\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>1,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate interest expense\n</td> <td>3,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(428\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total adjusted expenses\n</td> <td>55,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ENI\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,357\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4,738\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: Corporate interest expense\n</td> <td>3,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(428\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: Depreciation of fixed assets\n</td> <td>1,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ENI EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5,051\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ENI per share -

Further, since its launch in the fourth quarter of 2014, we recognized incentive fees for the first time from the Warehouse Fund. Management fees increased by $5.2 million or 9% as a result of increased AUM of credit funds year over year, and a full year of fees from CLOs issued in 2014. Net investment income decreased by $12.3 million or 87% related to an increase of $13.5 million in unrealized losses, as a result of significant declines in the market value of loans and CLO securities compared to the prior year.\nAdjusted expenses-Total adjusted expenses increased by $2.4 million or 5% primarily due to increases in adjusted Share based compensation and adjusted Professional fees. These increases were offset by decreases in adjusted Corporate interest expense and adjusted Employee compensation and benefits.\nAdjusted share based compensation increased as we recognized (i) a full year of amortization on equity awards granted during 2014 and (ii) additional expenses from the acceleration of vesting terms on certain restricted stock unit awards granted to the Company's Co-Presidents (\"Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\"-Note 12). Further, adjusted Professional fees increased to support the growth and diversification of the business. These increases were partially offset by the reduction of adjusted Corporate interest expense primarily related to the conversion of the Company's Convertible Notes in July 2014 and adjusted Employee compensation and benefits from a reduction in incentive-based compensation compared to the prior year.\nThe following is a reconciliation of GAAP Net income (loss) attributable to CIFC LLC to ENI:\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP Net income (loss) attributable to CIFC LLC\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reconciling and other items:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>25,239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization and impairment of intangibles\n</td> <td>8,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,149\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management fee sharing arrangements (1)\n</td> <td>(11,521\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,716\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (gain)/loss on contingent liabilities and other\n</td> <td>2,210\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employee compensation costs (2)\n</td> <td>5,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,610\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management fees attributable to non-core funds\n</td> <td>(654\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(814\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (3)\n</td> <td>2,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>395\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total reconciling items\n</td> <td>31,023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,714\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ENI\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,357\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: Corporate interest expense\n</td> <td>3,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: Depreciation of fixed assets\n</td> <td>1,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ENI EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nExplanatory Notes:\n______________________________\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>We share management fees on certain of the acquired CLOs we manage (shared with the party that sold the funds to CIFC, or an affiliate thereof).

These covenants also limit CIFC Corp.'s ability to make distributions to its related parties, including CIFC LLC.\nCovenants-Senior Notes-On November 2, 2015, CIFC Corp. issued $40.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 8.5% unsecured senior notes due October 30, 2025 (the Senior Notes\u201d) and guaranteed by CIFC LLC and certain subsidiaries. Under the terms of the related indenture, certain consolidated entities such as consolidated CLOs, Warehouses and Funds (\"Investment Vehicles\") do not guarantee the notes. Further, the indenture provides that entities holding at least 90% of the Company's consolidated total assets are guarantors. The Company may designate entities within its corporate structure as non-guarantor entities (\"Unrestricted Entities\" and together with Investment Vehicles, \"Non-Guarantor\"). The Senior Notes indenture includes certain restrictive covenants including a restricted payments covenant that restricts the Company's ability to pay dividends or make distributions in respect of our equity securities, subject to a number of exceptions and conditions.\nPrior to October 30, 2020 (the \"Non-call Date\"), we, at our option, may redeem all or a portion of the notes subject at a redemption price equal to (i) the principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus (ii) accrued and unpaid interest through the date of redemption plus (iii) a make whole payment. Any time on and after October 30, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 and thereafter, we, at our option, may redeem, all or a portion of the notes at a redemption price equal to 104.250%, 102.834%, 101.417%, or 100.000%, respectively, of the aggregate principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. Further, upon a change of control event, as defined by the indenture, the issuer must offer to repurchase the notes at 101%.\nTotal debt issuance costs related to the issuance of the Senior Notes of $2.1 million was capitalized and recorded as a contra liability, resulting in a reduction of the total principal balance. Debt issuance costs are amortized over the term of the notes. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded an aggregate interest expense of $0.5 million related to these notes.\nLease Commitments-The future minimum commitments under our lease agreement are as follows:\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017\n</td> <td>1,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018\n</td> <td>1,680\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019\n</td> <td>1,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020\n</td> <td>1,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>3,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,904\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsolidated VIEs-Although we consolidate all the assets and liabilities of the Consolidated VIEs (including the Consolidated CLOs, warehouses and other investment products), our maximum exposure to loss is limited to our investments and beneficial interests in the Consolidated VIEs and the receivables of management fees from the Consolidated VIEs. All of these items are eliminated upon consolidation. The assets of each of the Consolidated VIEs are administered by the trustee of each fund solely as collateral to satisfy the obligations of the Consolidated VIEs. If we were to liquidate, the assets of the Consolidated VIEs would not be available to our general creditors, and as a result, we do not consider them our assets. Additionally, the investors in the debt and residual interests of the Consolidated VIEs have no recourse to our general assets. Therefore, this debt is not our obligation.\nRelated Party Transactions\nDFR Holdings-As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, DFR Holdings owned approximately 18.8 million of the Company's shares. Accordingly, DFR Holdings received quarterly distributions from CIFC (\"Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\"-Note 12). In addition, the DFR Warrants provide DFR Holdings the right to purchase 2.0 million of the Company's voting common shares which were scheduled to expire on September 24, 2015. On September 24, 2015, the terms of the warrants were extended to January 24, 2017 in exchange for cash of $0.4 million (\"Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\"-Note 12).\nIn August 2014, we entered into a consulting agreement with DFR Holdings whereby DFR Holdings agreed to provide CIFC with ongoing advisory services such as the participation in financial, tax and strategic planning/budgeting, investor interface, new product initiatives, fund raising and recruiting. During both the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we expensed $2.0 million in connection with the consulting agreement.\nIn addition, pursuant to the Third Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement with DFR Holdings dated December 2, 2013, the Company agreed to nominate to the Board six directors designated by DFR Holdings (the \"DFR Designees\"). The number of directors that can be designated by DFR Holdings will be reduced in the event that DFR Holdings decreases its ownership (on a diluted basis) in CIFC. If DFR Holdings' ownership falls below 5%, it will lose the right to designate any director. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the DFR Designees earned an aggregate $0.7 million and $0.8 million, respectively, related to their services as directors of CIFC.\nRelated party transactions in 2014 included $1.9 million of interest expense paid to DFR Holdings on the Convertible Notes which were subsequently converted into 4,132,231 shares.\nOther-As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, a board member held $1.0 million of income notes in one of the Company's sponsored CLOs, CIFC Funding 2013-II, Ltd., through an entity in which he is a 50% equity holder.\nFunds-All CIFC general partner's investments in credit funds are related party transactions (\"Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\"- Note 2). As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, key employees and directors of CIFC (including related entities) invested an aggregate of $4.7 million in four CIFC managed funds. Key employees are not charged management or incentive fees, where applicable, on their investment. Directors were charged management and/or incentive fees, where applicable, similar to certain other investors. For all periods presented in 2015 and 2014, these fees were de minimis.\nInvestment in Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries of CIFC LLC-As part of the Reorganization Transaction, CIFC Corp. made a non-cash distribution in kind of certain of its subsidiary entities holding certain investment assets (e.g. investments in CLOs and Funds) to other wholly-owned subsidiaries of CIFC LLC. CIFC Corp. (i) made a non-cash distribution in kind of $110.0 million (of which $42.0 million was cash held by CIFC Corp.) and (ii) retained 85,000 non-voting Series A Preferred Units (\"Preferred Units\") issued by certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of CIFC LLC with a par value of $85.0 million. The Preferred Units will pay annual distributions of 3.5%, must be redeemed or retired by January 29, 2026, and at the election of the holder, are callable four years after issuance at par plus accrued and unpaid distributions. As of December 31, 2015, CIFC Corp.'s investment in the Preferred Units was reported in \"Investment in wholly-owned subsidiaries of CIFC LLC\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheet of CIFC Corp. This is an intercompany transaction and has been eliminated upon consolidation of CIFC LLC's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSenior Notes-During 2015, CIFC Corp. issued $40.0 million of Senior Notes which were fully and unconditionally guaranteed by CIFC LLC and certain subsidiaries (\"Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\"-Note 18).\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we did not maintain any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance, special purpose or VIEs, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Further, as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we did not guarantee any obligations of unconsolidated entities, enter into any commitments or express intent to provide additional funding to any such entities.\nSubsequent Events\nSubsequent to year end, our Board declared an aggregate cash distribution of $0.34 per share; composed of a quarterly cash distribution of $0.10 per share and a special distribution of $0.24 per share issued in order to defray a portion of the U.S. Federal income tax liability of shareholders arising from the Reorganization Transaction. The distribution will be paid on April 15, 2016 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on April 1, 2016.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur significant accounting policies are disclosed in Item 8 - \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\"-Note 3. Our most critical accounting policies involve judgments and estimates that could affect our reported assets and liabilities, as well as our reported revenues and expenses. These accounting policies and estimates are discussed below. We believe that all of the judgments and estimates inherent in our financial statements were reasonable as of the date thereof, based upon information available to us at the time. We rely on management's experience and analysis of historical and current market data in order to arrive at what we believe to be reasonable estimates. Under varying conditions, we could report materially different amounts arising under these critical accounting policies.\nFair Value Measurements and Presentation-The degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market parameters. For financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that trade actively and have quoted market prices or observable market parameters, there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value. When observable market prices and parameters are not fully available, management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value. In addition, changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data. For example, reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable. Therefore, when market data is not available, we would use valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value measurement.\nSee \"Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\"-Notes 3 and 5 for a complete discussion on how we determine the fair value of financial and non-financial assets and financial liabilities and the related measurement techniques and estimates involved.\nVariable Interest Entities- In February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued ASU 2015-02. The amendments changed the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. We adopted this guidance on a modified retroactive basis as of January 1, 2015 (\"Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\"-Note 3).\nAssessing if an entity is a variable interest entity and if we are the primary beneficiary (\"PB\") involves judgment and analysis on a structure-by-structure basis. Generally, we determine whether we are the PB of a VIE through a qualitative assessment; however, when deemed necessary, a quantitative assessment may also be performed. This consolidation assessment is performed upon inception of the relationship and reconsidered on an ongoing basis. In the PB determination for CLOs, to determine significance, we evaluated our right to receive and obligation to absorb the VIEs' expected future gains and losses. The expected future gains and losses of the VIEs are determined based on internally developed discounted cash flow models that utilize both observable and unobservable inputs. Significant inputs to the models include the structure of the VIEs and estimates related to loan default rates, recovery rates, projected call dates, prepayment rates and discount rates. In the PB determination for warehouses, we consolidate warehouses when (i) our investment management services meet the power criteria and when (ii) we have contributed significant equity providing us with the right to receive potentially significant gains and the obligation to absorb potentially significant losses of the warehouse (the economic criteria).\nBusiness Combinations-We are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values. The estimates used to determine the fair value of long-lived assets, such as intangible assets, can be complex and require significant judgments. We use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation firms, when necessary, to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired long-lived assets. This includes estimates and judgments as to the expectations of future cash flows of the acquired business, the allocation of these cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, and the estimated useful lives of intangible assets. If actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates, this could result in possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill or require acceleration of the amortization expense of intangible assets with finite lives. We periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate. Contingent consideration for business combinations and contingent liabilities assumed in business combinations are remeasured at fair value at each reporting date with changes in fair value recorded within net gain (loss) on investments, loans, derivatives and liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nGoodwill-Goodwill represents the excess cost of a business combination over the fair value of the net assets acquired. We review goodwill periodically, at least on an annual basis, considering factors such as our projected cash flows and revenues and earnings multiples of comparable companies, to determine whether the carrying value of goodwill is impaired. If goodwill is deemed to be impaired, the difference between the carrying amount reflected in the financial statements and the estimated fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs. We have one reporting unit for which goodwill is tested for impairment. In evaluating the recoverability of goodwill, we derive the fair value of our reporting unit utilizing both the income and market approaches. Under the income approach, we make various assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair value of the reporting unit. Under the market approach, we determine the fair value of the reporting unit based on multiples of EBITDA of comparable publicly-traded companies.\nWe must make various assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair value of the reporting unit. Key assumptions used in the income approach include, but are not limited to, the discount rate, revenue growth rates over the next five years and the terminal growth rate. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, or if we change our reporting structure, we may be required to record impairment charges. A portion or all of goodwill may become impaired in future periods if we are not successful in achieving our expected cash flow levels, if global economic conditions deteriorate from current levels or if other events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable.\nWe completed our annual impairment reviews for 2015 and 2014 and determined that the goodwill recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet was not impaired. The underlying assumptions and estimates used in the impairment test are made as of a point in time (the date of our goodwill impairment test). Subsequent changes in these assumptions and estimates could change the result of the impairment test. Based on the reviews performed for 2015 and 2014, we concluded that our sole reporting unit had an estimated fair value in excess of carrying value. If our reporting unit's expected revenue growth over the next five years falls below our current expected growth rate, a portion or all of our goodwill may be impaired in future periods.\nIntangible Assets-Intangible assets are comprised of assets with finite lives acquired in a business combination. The largest component of our intangible assets are those associated with the CLO investment management contracts. The intangible assets associated with CLO investment management contracts are amortized over their useful lives, either on a straight line basis or based on a ratio of expected discounted cash flows of the contracts. We consider our own assumptions in the underlying management fee projections which include the structure of the CLOs and estimates related to loan default rates, recoveries and discount rates. A change in those projections could have a significant impact on our amortization expense.\nIntangible assets with finite lives are tested for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment charge is recorded if the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value. Impairment testing for the intangible assets associated with our CLO investment management\ncontracts includes a comparison of the estimated remaining undiscounted cash flows related to those CLO management contracts to the carrying value of the intangible asset. If the carrying value of the intangible asset is less than the estimated remaining undiscounted cash flows, no further testing is performed, and the intangible asset is not deemed impaired. If the carrying value of the intangible asset is greater than the estimated remaining undiscounted cash flows, then further analysis is performed to determine if the asset is impaired, including an analysis of the estimated remaining discounted cash flows.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we received notices from holders of certain CLOs exercising their rights to call the CLOs for redemption. As a result of these calls, we recorded a $1.8 million expense to fully impair the intangible assets associated with these management contracts.\nIncome Taxes-CIFC LLC is a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and is not subject to U.S. income taxes. CIFC Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company is subject to federal, state and local corporate income taxes at the entity level and the related tax provisions are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCurrent federal income taxes are recognized based on amounts estimated to be payable or recoverable as a result of taxable operations for the current year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future income tax consequences (temporary differences) attributable to the difference between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective income tax basis using tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period when the change is enacted. When evaluating the realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider, among other matters, estimates of expected future taxable income, nature of current and cumulative losses, existing and projected book/tax differences, and forecasts of our business operations. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\nNet deferred tax assets have been recognized based on management's belief that taxable income of the appropriate character, more likely than not, will be sufficient to realize the benefits of these assets over time. In the event that actual results differ from our expectations, we may be required to record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, which may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe record uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740 on the basis of a two-step process whereby (1) we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority.\nRecent Accounting Updates\nFor a discussion of the impact of new accounting pronouncements on our financial condition or results of operations, see \"Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\"-Note 3. For segment reporting discussion, see \"Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\"-Note 1.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe statements in this discussion regarding the industry outlook and our expectations regarding the future performance of our business and the other non-historical statements are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described in Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Part I-Item 1A - \"Risk Factors.\" You should read the following discussion together with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Part II-Item 8 - \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nOverview\nOn December 31, 2015, CIFC Corp. entered into a series of transactions (the \"Reorganization Transaction\") to become a subsidiary of CIFC LLC, a publicly traded limited liability company. CIFC LLC (together with its subsidiaries, \"CIFC,\" we\u201d or \"us\") is a Delaware limited liability company headquartered in New York City. We are a private debt manager specializing in secured U.S. corporate loan strategies. Our primary business is to provide investment management services for institutional investors, including pension funds, hedge funds, asset management firms, banks, insurance companies and other types of investors around the world.\nFee Earning Assets Under Management ( Fee Earning AUM\u201d or AUM\u201d) refers to principal balance, net asset value or value of assets managed by us on which we earn management and/or incentive fees. Our AUM is primarily comprised of Collateralized Loan Obligations (\"CLOs\"). In addition, we manage credit funds and other loan-based products (together, \"Non-CLO products\" and together with CLOs, \"Funds\"). We manage these credit products through opportunistic investment strategies where we seek to generate current income and/or capital appreciation, primarily through senior secured corporate loan investments ( SSCLs\u201d) and, to a lesser extent, other investments. We also manage Collateralized Debt Obligations ( CDOs\u201d), which we do not expect to issue in the future.\nWe have three primary sources of revenue: management fees, incentive fees and investment income. Management fees are generally based on a percentage of AUM of the Funds. Incentive fees are earned based on the performance of the Funds. Investment income represents interest income and realized/unrealized gains and losses on investments in the products sponsored by us and third parties.\nAs of December 31, 2015, DFR Holdings LLC (\"DFR Holdings\") owned approximately 74% of the Company's outstanding shares (approximately 70% on a fully diluted basis).\nRecent Developments\nReorganization Transaction\nOn December 31, 2015, CIFC completed a series of transactions to change our top-level form of organization from a corporation to a limited liability company that is taxed as a partnership rather than a corporation for U.S. Federal income tax purposes and allows us to minimize entity-level taxation on investment income. These tax efficiencies may enable us to increase distributions to shareholders and/or investment in our business. As part of the Reorganization Transaction, CIFC Corp. distributed ownership of certain of its subsidiary entities holding certain investment assets to CIFC LLC and retained non-voting Series A Preferred Units (\"Preferred Units\") issued by certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of CIFC LLC (see Related Party Transactions below).\nEach share of common stock of CIFC Corp. outstanding immediately prior to the Reorganization Transaction was converted into the right to receive one common share representing a limited liability company interest in CIFC LLC. Further, CIFC LLC assumed all obligations under the CIFC Corp. 2011 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the \"Stock Incentive Plan\"). All the terms and conditions that were in effect immediately prior to the Reorganization Transaction under each outstanding equity award assumed by CIFC LLC will continue in full force and effect after the Reorganization Transaction, except that the interests issuable under each such award will be common shares of CIFC LLC instead of common stock of CIFC Corp.\nCIFC Corp. remains the issuer and primary obligor of our Junior Subordinated Notes and the Senior Notes (see below). Further, CIFC LLC and certain other subsidiaries of CIFC LLC have provided full and unconditional guarantees of the obligations of CIFC Corp. under the Junior Subordinated Notes and the Senior Notes.\nExecutive Overview\nThe past year proved to be the most challenging for the leveraged credit market since the end of the financial crisis. Commodity prices came under pressure over the summer and risk assets sold off starting in August. The U.S. High Yield Market was down 5% and the U.S. Corporate Loan market recorded its first negative total return since 2008.\nOur balance sheet investments in CIFC-managed funds outperformed their respective benchmarks. Both the Senior Secured Corporate Loan Fund and the Tactical Income Fund produced positive returns vis-\u00e0-vis losses in both the CS Loan Index and the LSTA Loan Index. The pronounced weakness in the CLO market led to a decline in mark-to-market valuation of our balance sheet CLO investments. Consequently, net investment income dropped to $1.9 million compared with $14.1 million in 2014. Excluding investment income, we increased ENI EBITDA by $7.2 million or 26% year-over-year.\nIn 2015, we were successful in sponsoring 5 new CLOs for a combined AUM of $2.6 billion. Strong equity sponsorship allowed us to issue all 5 transactions on a non-risk retention compliant basis. We are well capitalized to issue risk retention compliant CLOs. We successfully completed a 10-year $40 million senior unsecured bond offering in the fourth quarter to further bolster our capacity to invest in risk retention compliant CLOs. We have $210.4 million of cash and investments on our balance sheet, most of which will be available for risk retention compliance over the next 3 years.\nOur total return corporate credit loan business has outperformed the various leveraged loan indices (S&P LSTA, CS LL & JPM LL) since inception, for three consecutive years. We successfully launched three new funds; including our first white-labeled loan funds in Korea and Switzerland. The AUM of our credit fund platform now exceeds $1.0 billion. Our loan portfolios continue to perform well and defaults continue to be substantially lower compared to the loan indices. We have maintained our rigorous underwriting process and actively managed risk across well-diversified portfolios. We first started to cut our energy exposure in late August and early September of 2014 and continue to be defensively positioned. We remain underweight the sector with current exposure below 3%.\nCLO issuance has been slow during the course of the first two months of 2016. Forecasts from various banks expect market conditions to improve in the second half of the year. We are well positioned to access the market once conditions become more compelling. Loan prepayment rates have slowed significantly. We expect loan prepayment rates to remain lower until CLO new issuance volumes return, increasing the duration of our existing CLO AUM. We are taking advantage of lower loan prices to build par in our 2.0 CLOs. We expect the current investment opportunity to drive improved returns and with that, potentially higher incentive fees on our existing CLOs in the future.\nFee Earning AUM\nFee Earning AUM or AUM refers to the assets managed by the Company on which we receive management fees and/or incentive fees. Generally, with respect to CLOs, management fees are paid to the Company based on the aggregate collateral balance at par plus principal cash, and with respect to Non-CLO funds, the value of the assets in such funds. The following table summarizes Fee Earning AUM:\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands, except # of Accounts) (1)(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Number of Accounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fee Earning AUM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Number of Accounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fee Earning AUM\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Post 2011 CLOs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,860,519\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,402,986\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Legacy CLOs (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,559,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,960,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total CLOs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,419,585\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,363,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit Funds (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,062,712\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>593,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Loan-Based Products (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>573,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>719,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Non-CLOs (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,635,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,312,626\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Loan-Based AUM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,055,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,676,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ABS and Corporate Bond CDOs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>592,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>687,555\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Fee Earning AUM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,648,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,364,044\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nExplanatory Notes:\n_________________________________\n (1) Fee Earning AUM attributable to ABS and Corporate Bond CDO products is expected to continue to decline as these funds run-off per their contractual terms. \n (2) Fee Earning AUM is based on the latest available monthly report issued by the trustee or fund administrator prior to the end of the period, and may not tie back to the Consolidated GAAP financial statements. \n (3) Legacy CLOs represent all managed CLOs issued prior to 2011, including CLOs acquired since 2011 but issued prior to 2011. \n (4) Management fees for Non-CLO products vary by fund and may not be similar to a CLO. \nFee Earning AUM activities are as follows:\nTable 40: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total loan-based AUM -

All CDOs and certain CLOs we manage have passed their reinvestment periods (see table below). Therefore, proceeds from paydowns are required to repay the CLO's or CDO's liabilities. As expected, AUM on these CLOs and CDOs continued to decline during the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition, 9 CLOs were called during 2015, which generated additional incentive fees. This, along with redemptions from other loan-based products, reduced AUM by $2.7 billion, resulting in an overall net increase in AUM of $0.3 billion.\nLoan-based AUM\nSince 2012, CIFC has raised $11.4 billion of new AUM through organic growth, which has more than offset the run-off from Legacy CLOs (including acquired CLOs). Our Legacy CLO AUM of $2.6 billion is less than a fifth of our total CLO AUM of $12.4 billion and we anticipate it will run off over the next three years.\nThe structure of the CLOs we manage affects the management fees paid to us.

the \"first optional call date\" and subject to satisfaction of certain conditions. \n (2) Termination of reinvestment period refers to the date after which we can no longer use certain principal collections to purchase additional collateral, and such collections are instead used to repay the outstanding amounts of certain debt securities issued by the CLO. \n (3) Represents the contractual maturity of the CLO. Generally, the actual maturity of the deal is expected to occur before the contractual maturity. \nResults of Consolidated Operations\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the financial statements of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, the entities in which we have a controlling interest (\"Consolidated Funds\") and variable interest entities (\"VIEs\" or \"Consolidated VIEs\") for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary (together with the Consolidated Funds, the \"Consolidated Entities\"). Consolidated VIEs includes certain CLOs and warehouses we manage.\nIn February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standard Update \"ASU\" 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810) - Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis (\"ASU 2015-02\"). The amendments changed the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. We elected to early adopt this guidance on a modified retroactive basis (as of January 1, 2015) (\"Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\"-Note 3). The adoption of ASU 2015-02 resulted in the deconsolidation of 30 CLOs and the Senior Secured Corporate Loan Fund on a modified retrospective basis on January 1, 2015. As of December 31, 2015 the Company consolidated 2 CLOs and 2 credit funds. Year over year, our Consolidated Statements of Operations will not be comparative for certain individual line items.\nThe following table presents our comparative Consolidated Statements of Operations

unconsolidated CLOs, CDOs and Non-CLO products and net investment income from investments in unconsolidated entities. Year-over-year total net revenues decreased significantly due to the deconsolidation of 30 CLOs and the Senior Secured Corporate Loan Fund as of January 1, 2015. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2015-02, revenues from these assets were eliminated in consolidation.\nTotal Expenses\nEmployee compensation and benefits-The increase primarily relates to contractual fee sharing arrangements which required the Company to pay certain former employees incentive fees collected on CLOs acquired from Columbus Nova Credit Investments Management, LLC (\"CNCIM\"). During 2015, we received higher incentive fees on such CLOs. The increase was partially offset by a reduction in incentive-based compensation compared to the prior year.\nShare based compensation-During 2015, we expensed a full year of amortization on 1.3 million of RSUs and 0.4 million of stock options granted during 2014. In addition, in 2015, we recognized additional expenses from the acceleration of vesting terms on certain restricted stock unit awards granted to the Company's Co-Presidents (\"Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\"-Note 12).\nProfessional fees-Year over year, professional fees increased primarily in relation to expenses incurred for the Reorganization Transaction and to support the growth and diversification of the business.\nGeneral and administrative expenses-In 2014, we recorded a $0.6 million expense for the settlement of litigation with a former employee.\nDepreciation and amortization-In 2015, we had lower amortization expense for intangible assets since these management contracts were either impaired or written off in the prior year.\nImpairments of intangible assets-During the year ended December 31, 2015, we received notice from holders of certain CLOs exercising their right to call those CLOs for redemption. As a result of these calls, we recorded impairment charges of $1.8 million to fully impair intangible assets associated with these management contracts.\nConsolidated Entities - Expenses and Interest Expenses-Year-over-year total expenses from the Consolidated Entities decreased significantly primarily due to the deconsolidation of 30 CLOs and the Senior Secured Corporate Loan Fund as of January 1, 2015. As of December 31, 2015 the Company consolidated 2 CLOs and 2 credit funds and as of December 31, 2014, we consolidated 31 CLOs, 1 warehouse, and 2 credit funds. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2015-02, expenses from these entities were eliminated in consolidation.\nNet other income (expense) and gain (loss)-Subsequent to the adoption of ASU 2015-02, we deconsolidated 30 CLOs and the Senior Secured Corporate Loan Fund on a modified retrospective basis on January 1, 2015. As such, the balances are not comparable year over year.\nNet gain (loss) on investment-Net gain (loss) on investment includes the unrealized appreciation or depreciation and realized gains and losses on the investments in CLOs, warehouses and credit funds which we are not required to consolidate. In general, the decrease primarily related to an increase in unrealized losses as a result of significant declines in the market value of loans and CLO securities compared to the prior year. See Non-GAAP Measures section for further discussion.\nNet (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in Consolidated Entities-Subsequent to the adoption of ASU 2015-02, we deconsolidated 30 CLOs and the Senior Secured Corporate Loan Fund on a modified retrospective basis on January 1, 2015. As such, the balances are not comparable year over year. As of December 31, 2015, we consolidated 2 CLOs and 2 credit funds, and as of December 31, 2014, we consolidated 31 CLOs, 1 warehouse, and 2 credit funds.\nIncome tax expense/benefit-CIFC's Provision for Taxes for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $25.2 million and $22.2 million, respectively. This resulted in an effective tax rate of 96.3% and 225.3%, respectively, based on our Income (loss) before income taxes of $26.2 million and $9.8 million, respectively.\nThe primary factor that contributed to the fluctuation in the effective tax rate is that pre-tax book income (loss) includes $0.6 million for 2015 and $(20.7) million for 2014 of income/(loss) from consolidated VIEs and VOEs. Income/(loss) from consolidated VIEs and VOEs is included in the pre-tax income/(loss) but is not included in the calculation of taxable income. The effective tax rate in 2015 and 2014 was impacted by the write-down of deferred tax assets of $6.3 million and $6.4 million, respectively, resulting from tax law changes enacted by New York City in 2015 and New York State in 2014. These tax law changes were effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015. The 2015 effective tax rate was further impacted by the reversal of the deferred tax assets in connection with the Reorganization Transaction (see \"Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\"-Note 15).\nWe expect a reduction in our effective tax rate going forward as the result of the Reorganization Transaction. Inclusion of consolidated VIEs and VOEs in the pretax income/(loss) is expected to continue to impact the effective tax rate for future years.\nENI and Deconsolidated Non-GAAP Statements (Non-GAAP Measures)\nENI and ENI EBITDA\nENI is a non-GAAP financial measure of profitability which management uses in addition to GAAP Net income (loss) attributable to CIFC LLC to measure the performance of our core business (excluding non-core products). We believe ENI reflects the nature and substance of the business, the economic results driven by management and incentive fee revenues from the management of client funds and earnings on our investments. ENI represents GAAP Net income (loss) attributable to CIFC LLC excluding (i) income taxes, (ii) merger and acquisition related items including fee-sharing arrangements, amortization and impairments of intangible assets and gain (loss) on contingent consideration for earn-outs, (iii) non-cash compensation related to profits interests granted by CIFC Parent Holdings LLC (\"CIFC Parent\") in June 2011, (iv) revenues attributable to non-core investment products, (v) advances for fund organizational expenses, and (vi) certain other items as detailed.\nENI EBITDA is also a non-GAAP financial measure that management considers, in addition to GAAP Net income (loss) attributable to CIFC LLC, to evaluate our core performance. ENI EBITDA represents ENI before corporate interest expense and depreciation of fixed assets, a non-cash item.\nENI and ENI EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies, as they are non-GAAP financial measures that are not based on a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and therefore may be defined differently by other companies. In addition, ENI and ENI EBITDA should be considered an addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table presents our components of ENI for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (1):\nTable 46: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands, except per share amounts)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Fees from CLOs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,709\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subordinated Fees from CLOs\n</td> <td>34,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management Fees from Non-CLO products\n</td> <td>3,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,705\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total management Fees\n</td> <td>62,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Incentive Fees\n</td> <td>22,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income (2)\n</td> <td>1,866\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,273\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(87)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total adjusted net revenues\n</td> <td>86,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88,811\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,356\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employee compensation and benefits\n</td> <td>26,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,308\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(406\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Share-based compensation\n</td> <td>5,348\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,579\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional services\n</td> <td>7,846\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>587\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>9,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(255\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>1,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate interest expense\n</td> <td>3,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(428\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total adjusted expenses\n</td> <td>55,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ENI\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,357\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4,738\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: Corporate interest expense\n</td> <td>3,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(428\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: Depreciation of fixed assets\n</td> <td>1,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ENI EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5,051\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ENI per share -

Further, since its launch in the fourth quarter of 2014, we recognized incentive fees for the first time from the Warehouse Fund. Management fees increased by $5.2 million or 9% as a result of increased AUM of credit funds year over year, and a full year of fees from CLOs issued in 2014. Net investment income decreased by $12.3 million or 87% related to an increase of $13.5 million in unrealized losses, as a result of significant declines in the market value of loans and CLO securities compared to the prior year.\nAdjusted expenses-Total adjusted expenses increased by $2.4 million or 5% primarily due to increases in adjusted Share based compensation and adjusted Professional fees. These increases were offset by decreases in adjusted Corporate interest expense and adjusted Employee compensation and benefits.\nAdjusted share based compensation increased as we recognized (i) a full year of amortization on equity awards granted during 2014 and (ii) additional expenses from the acceleration of vesting terms on certain restricted stock unit awards granted to the Company's Co-Presidents (\"Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\"-Note 12). Further, adjusted Professional fees increased to support the growth and diversification of the business. These increases were partially offset by the reduction of adjusted Corporate interest expense primarily related to the conversion of the Company's Convertible Notes in July 2014 and adjusted Employee compensation and benefits from a reduction in incentive-based compensation compared to the prior year.\nThe following is a reconciliation of GAAP Net income (loss) attributable to CIFC LLC to ENI:\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP Net income (loss) attributable to CIFC LLC\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reconciling and other items:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>25,239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization and impairment of intangibles\n</td> <td>8,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,149\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management fee sharing arrangements (1)\n</td> <td>(11,521\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,716\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (gain)/loss on contingent liabilities and other\n</td> <td>2,210\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employee compensation costs (2)\n</td> <td>5,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,610\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management fees attributable to non-core funds\n</td> <td>(654\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(814\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (3)\n</td> <td>2,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>395\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total reconciling items\n</td> <td>31,023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,714\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ENI\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,357\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: Corporate interest expense\n</td> <td>3,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: Depreciation of fixed assets\n</td> <td>1,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ENI EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nExplanatory Notes:\n______________________________\n (1) We share management fees on certain of the acquired CLOs we manage (shared with the party that sold the funds to CIFC, or an affiliate thereof).

Notes:\n________________________________\n (1) As a result of the Reorganization Transaction (see Related Parties below), CIFC Corp. made a non-cash distribution in kind of certain of its subsidiary entities holding certain investment assets (e.g. investments in CLOs and Funds) to CIFC LLC. As such, as of December 31, 2015, CIFC Corp. did not consolidate any CLOs. \n (2) Pursuant to the adoption of ASU 2015-03, the carrying values of recourse debt has been presented net of debt issuance costs. \n (3) March Junior Subordinated Notes bear interest at an annual rate of three month LIBOR plus 2.58% until maturity on October 30, 2035. Prior to April 30, 2015, these notes bore interest at an annual rate of 1%. \n (4) October Junior Subordinated Notes bear interest at an annual rate of three month LIBOR plus 3.50% and mature on October 30, 2035. \n (5) The Senior Notes bear interest at 8.5% and mature on October 30, 2025. \n (6) Pursuant to the adoption of ASU 2014-13, Long-term debt of the Consolidated CLOs has been remeasured in accordance with the new guidance (\"Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\"-Notes 3 and 5). The subordinated notes of the Consolidated CLOs do not have a stated interest rate and have been excluded from the calculation of the weighted average borrowing rate. As of December 31, 2015, long-term debt of the Consolidated CLOs includes $153.1 million of other investment products. \n (7) Long-term debt of warehouses not held by the Company is recorded at fair value. The fair value excludes the preferred shares of warehouses not held by the Company. As warehouses are generally terminated before the end of their terms, they are excluded from the calculation of the weighted average remaining maturity. \nCovenants-Junior Subordinated Notes-The Junior Subordinated Notes contain certain restrictive covenants including a restricted payments covenant that restricts our ability to pay dividends or make distributions in respect of our equity securities, subject to a number of exceptions and conditions. These covenants also limit CIFC Corp.'s ability to make distributions to its related parties, including CIFC LLC.\nCovenants-Senior Notes-On November 2, 2015, CIFC Corp. issued $40.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 8.5% unsecured senior notes due October 30, 2025 (the Senior Notes\u201d) and guaranteed by CIFC LLC and certain subsidiaries. Under the terms of the related indenture, certain consolidated entities such as consolidated CLOs, Warehouses and Funds (\"Investment Vehicles\") do not guarantee the notes. Further, the indenture provides that entities holding at least 90% of the Company's consolidated total assets are guarantors. The Company may designate entities within its corporate structure as non-guarantor entities (\"Unrestricted Entities\" and together with Investment Vehicles, \"Non-Guarantor\"). The Senior Notes indenture includes certain restrictive covenants including a restricted payments covenant that restricts the Company's ability to pay dividends or make distributions in respect of our equity securities, subject to a number of exceptions and conditions.\nPrior to October 30, 2020 (the \"Non-call Date\"), we, at our option, may redeem all or a portion of the notes subject at a redemption price equal to (i) the principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus (ii) accrued and unpaid interest through the date of redemption plus (iii) a make whole payment. Any time on and after October 30, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 and thereafter, we, at our option, may redeem, all or a portion of the notes at a redemption price equal to 104.250%, 102.834%, 101.417%, or 100.000%, respectively, of the aggregate principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. Further, upon a change of control event, as defined by the indenture, the issuer must offer to repurchase the notes at 101%.\nTotal debt issuance costs related to the issuance of the Senior Notes of $2.1 million was capitalized and recorded as a contra liability, resulting in a reduction of the total principal balance. Debt issuance costs are amortized over the term of the notes. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded an aggregate interest expense of $0.5 million related to these notes.\nLease Commitments-The future minimum commitments under our lease agreement are as follows:\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017\n</td> <td>1,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018\n</td> <td>1,680\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019\n</td> <td>1,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020\n</td> <td>1,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>3,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,904\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsolidated VIEs-Although we consolidate all the assets and liabilities of the Consolidated VIEs (including the Consolidated CLOs, warehouses and other investment products), our maximum exposure to loss is limited to our investments and beneficial interests in the Consolidated VIEs and the receivables of management fees from the Consolidated VIEs. All of these items are eliminated upon consolidation. The assets of each of the Consolidated VIEs are administered by the trustee of each fund solely as collateral to satisfy the obligations of the Consolidated VIEs. If we were to liquidate, the assets of the Consolidated VIEs would not be available to our general creditors, and as a result, we do not consider them our assets. Additionally, the investors in the debt and residual interests of the Consolidated VIEs have no recourse to our general assets. Therefore, this debt is not our obligation.\nRelated Party Transactions\nDFR Holdings-As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, DFR Holdings owned approximately 18.8 million of the Company's shares. Accordingly, DFR Holdings received quarterly distributions from CIFC (\"Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\"-Note 12). In addition, the DFR Warrants provide DFR Holdings the right to purchase 2.0 million of the Company's voting common shares which were scheduled to expire on September 24, 2015. On September 24, 2015, the terms of the warrants were extended to January 24, 2017 in exchange for cash of $0.4 million (\"Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\"-Note 12).\nIn August 2014, we entered into a consulting agreement with DFR Holdings whereby DFR Holdings agreed to provide CIFC with ongoing advisory services such as the participation in financial, tax and strategic planning/budgeting, investor interface, new product initiatives, fund raising and recruiting. During both the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we expensed $2.0 million in connection with the consulting agreement.\nIn addition, pursuant to the Third Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement with DFR Holdings dated December 2, 2013, the Company agreed to nominate to the Board six directors designated by DFR Holdings (the \"DFR Designees\"). The number of directors that can be designated by DFR Holdings will be reduced in the event that DFR Holdings decreases its ownership (on a diluted basis) in CIFC. If DFR Holdings' ownership falls below 5%, it will lose the right to designate any director. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the DFR Designees earned an aggregate $0.7 million and $0.8 million, respectively, related to their services as directors of CIFC.\nRelated party transactions in 2014 included $1.9 million of interest expense paid to DFR Holdings on the Convertible Notes which were subsequently converted into 4,132,231 shares.\nOther-As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, a board member held $1.0 million of income notes in one of the Company's sponsored CLOs, CIFC Funding 2013-II, Ltd., through an entity in which he is a 50% equity holder.\nFunds-All CIFC general partner's investments in credit funds are related party transactions (\"Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\"- Note 2). As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, key employees and directors of CIFC (including related entities) invested an aggregate of $4.7 million in four CIFC managed funds. Key employees are not charged management or incentive fees, where applicable, on their investment. Directors were charged management and/or incentive fees, where applicable, similar to certain other investors. For all periods presented in 2015 and 2014, these fees were de minimis.\nInvestment in Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries of CIFC LLC-As part of the Reorganization Transaction, CIFC Corp. made a non-cash distribution in kind of certain of its subsidiary entities holding certain investment assets (e.g. investments in CLOs and Funds) to other wholly-owned subsidiaries of CIFC LLC. CIFC Corp. (i) made a non-cash distribution in kind of $110.0 million (of which $42.0 million was cash held by CIFC Corp.) and (ii) retained 85,000 non-voting Series A Preferred Units (\"Preferred Units\") issued by certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of CIFC LLC with a par value of $85.0 million. The Preferred Units will pay annual distributions of 3.5%, must be redeemed or retired by January 29, 2026, and at the election of the holder, are callable four years after issuance at par plus accrued and unpaid distributions. As of December 31, 2015, CIFC Corp.'s investment in the Preferred Units was reported in \"Investment in wholly-owned subsidiaries of CIFC LLC\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheet of CIFC Corp. This is an intercompany transaction and has been eliminated upon consolidation of CIFC LLC's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSenior Notes-During 2015, CIFC Corp. issued $40.0 million of Senior Notes which were fully and unconditionally guaranteed by CIFC LLC and certain subsidiaries (\"Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\"-Note 18).\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we did not maintain any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance, special purpose or VIEs, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Further, as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we did not guarantee any obligations of unconsolidated entities, enter into any commitments or express intent to provide additional funding to any such entities.\nSubsequent Events\nSubsequent to year end, our Board declared an aggregate cash distribution of $0.34 per share; composed of a quarterly cash distribution of $0.10 per share and a special distribution of $0.24 per share issued in order to defray a portion of the U.S. Federal income tax liability of shareholders arising from the Reorganization Transaction. The distribution will be paid on April 15, 2016 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on April 1, 2016.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur significant accounting policies are disclosed in Item 8 - \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\"-Note 3. Our most critical accounting policies involve judgments and estimates that could affect our reported assets and liabilities, as well as our reported revenues and expenses. These accounting policies and estimates are discussed below. We believe that all of the judgments and estimates inherent in our financial statements were reasonable as of the date thereof, based upon information available to us at the time. We rely on management's experience and analysis of historical and current market data in order to arrive at what we believe to be reasonable estimates. Under varying conditions, we could report materially different amounts arising under these critical accounting policies.\nFair Value Measurements and Presentation-The degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market parameters. For financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that trade actively and have quoted market prices or observable market parameters, there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value. When observable market prices and parameters are not fully available, management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value. In addition, changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data. For example, reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable. Therefore, when market data is not available, we would use valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value measurement.\nSee \"Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\"-Notes 3 and 5 for a complete discussion on how we determine the fair value of financial and non-financial assets and financial liabilities and the related measurement techniques and estimates involved.\nVariable Interest Entities- In February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued ASU 2015-02. The amendments changed the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. We adopted this guidance on a modified retroactive basis as of January 1, 2015 (\"Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\"-Note 3).\nAssessing if an entity is a variable interest entity and if we are the primary beneficiary (\"PB\") involves judgment and analysis on a structure-by-structure basis. Generally, we determine whether we are the PB of a VIE through a qualitative assessment; however, when deemed necessary, a quantitative assessment may also be performed. This consolidation assessment is performed upon inception of the relationship and reconsidered on an ongoing basis. In the PB determination for CLOs, to determine significance, we evaluated our right to receive and obligation to absorb the VIEs' expected future gains and losses. The expected future gains and losses of the VIEs are determined based on internally developed discounted cash flow models that utilize both observable and unobservable inputs. Significant inputs to the models include the structure of the VIEs and estimates related to loan default rates, recovery rates, projected call dates, prepayment rates and discount rates. In the PB determination for warehouses, we consolidate warehouses when (i) our investment management services meet the power criteria and when (ii) we have contributed significant equity providing us with the right to receive potentially significant gains and the obligation to absorb potentially significant losses of the warehouse (the economic criteria).\nBusiness Combinations-We are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values. The estimates used to determine the fair value of long-lived assets, such as intangible assets, can be complex and require significant judgments. We use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation firms, when necessary, to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired long-lived assets. This includes estimates and judgments as to the expectations of future cash flows of the acquired business, the allocation of these cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, and the estimated useful lives of intangible assets. If actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates, this could result in possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill or require acceleration of the amortization expense of intangible assets with finite lives. We periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate. Contingent consideration for business combinations and contingent liabilities assumed in business combinations are remeasured at fair value at each reporting date with changes in fair value recorded within net gain (loss) on investments, loans, derivatives and liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nGoodwill-Goodwill represents the excess cost of a business combination over the fair value of the net assets acquired. We review goodwill periodically, at least on an annual basis, considering factors such as our projected cash flows and revenues and earnings multiples of comparable companies, to determine whether the carrying value of goodwill is impaired. If goodwill is deemed to be impaired, the difference between the carrying amount reflected in the financial statements and the estimated fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs. We have one reporting unit for which goodwill is tested for impairment. In evaluating the recoverability of goodwill, we derive the fair value of our reporting unit utilizing both the income and market approaches. Under the income approach, we make various assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair value of the reporting unit. Under the market approach, we determine the fair value of the reporting unit based on multiples of EBITDA of comparable publicly-traded companies.\nWe must make various assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair value of the reporting unit. Key assumptions used in the income approach include, but are not limited to, the discount rate, revenue growth rates over the next five years and the terminal growth rate. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, or if we change our reporting structure, we may be required to record impairment charges. A portion or all of goodwill may become impaired in future periods if we are not successful in achieving our expected cash flow levels, if global economic conditions deteriorate from current levels or if other events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable.\nWe completed our annual impairment reviews for 2015 and 2014 and determined that the goodwill recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet was not impaired. The underlying assumptions and estimates used in the impairment test are made as of a point in time (the date of our goodwill impairment test). Subsequent changes in these assumptions and estimates could change the result of the impairment test. Based on the reviews performed for 2015 and 2014, we concluded that our sole reporting unit had an estimated fair value in excess of carrying value. If our reporting unit's expected revenue growth over the next five years falls below our current expected growth rate, a portion or all of our goodwill may be impaired in future periods.\nIntangible Assets-Intangible assets are comprised of assets with finite lives acquired in a business combination. The largest component of our intangible assets are those associated with the CLO investment management contracts. The intangible assets associated with CLO investment management contracts are amortized over their useful lives, either on a straight line basis or based on a ratio of expected discounted cash flows of the contracts. We consider our own assumptions in the underlying management fee projections which include the structure of the CLOs and estimates related to loan default rates, recoveries and discount rates. A change in those projections could have a significant impact on our amortization expense.\nIntangible assets with finite lives are tested for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment charge is recorded if the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value. Impairment testing for the intangible assets associated with our CLO investment management\ncontracts includes a comparison of the estimated remaining undiscounted cash flows related to those CLO management contracts to the carrying value of the intangible asset. If the carrying value of the intangible asset is less than the estimated remaining undiscounted cash flows, no further testing is performed, and the intangible asset is not deemed impaired. If the carrying value of the intangible asset is greater than the estimated remaining undiscounted cash flows, then further analysis is performed to determine if the asset is impaired, including an analysis of the estimated remaining discounted cash flows.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we received notices from holders of certain CLOs exercising their rights to call the CLOs for redemption. As a result of these calls, we recorded a $1.8 million expense to fully impair the intangible assets associated with these management contracts.\nIncome Taxes-CIFC LLC is a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and is not subject to U.S. income taxes. CIFC Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company is subject to federal, state and local corporate income taxes at the entity level and the related tax provisions are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCurrent federal income taxes are recognized based on amounts estimated to be payable or recoverable as a result of taxable operations for the current year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future income tax consequences (temporary differences) attributable to the difference between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective income tax basis using tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period when the change is enacted. When evaluating the realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider, among other matters, estimates of expected future taxable income, nature of current and cumulative losses, existing and projected book/tax differences, and forecasts of our business operations. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\nNet deferred tax assets have been recognized based on management's belief that taxable income of the appropriate character, more likely than not, will be sufficient to realize the benefits of these assets over time. In the event that actual results differ from our expectations, we may be required to record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, which may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe record uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740 on the basis of a two-step process whereby (1) we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority.\nRecent Accounting Updates\nFor a discussion of the impact of new accounting pronouncements on our financial condition or results of operations, see \"Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\"-Note 3. For segment reporting discussion, see \"Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\"-Note 1.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe statements in this discussion regarding the industry outlook and our expectations regarding the future performance of our business and the other non-historical statements are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described in Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Part I-Item 1A - \"Risk Factors.\" You should read the following discussion together with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Part II-Item 8 - \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nOverview\nOn December 31, 2015, CIFC Corp. entered into a series of transactions (the \"Reorganization Transaction\") to become a subsidiary of CIFC LLC, a publicly traded limited liability company. CIFC LLC (together with its subsidiaries, \"CIFC,\" we\u201d or \"us\") is a Delaware limited liability company headquartered in New York City. We are a private debt manager specializing in secured U.S. corporate loan strategies. Our primary business is to provide investment management services for institutional investors, including pension funds, hedge funds, asset management firms, banks, insurance companies and other types of investors around the world.\nFee Earning Assets Under Management ( Fee Earning AUM\u201d or AUM\u201d) refers to principal balance, net asset value or value of assets managed by us on which we earn management and/or incentive fees. Our AUM is primarily comprised of Collateralized Loan Obligations (\"CLOs\"). In addition, we manage credit funds and other loan-based products (together, \"Non-CLO products\" and together with CLOs, \"Funds\"). We manage these credit products through opportunistic investment strategies where we seek to generate current income and/or capital appreciation, primarily through senior secured corporate loan investments ( SSCLs\u201d) and, to a lesser extent, other investments. We also manage Collateralized Debt Obligations ( CDOs\u201d), which we do not expect to issue in the future.\nWe have three primary sources of revenue: management fees, incentive fees and investment income. Management fees are generally based on a percentage of AUM of the Funds. Incentive fees are earned based on the performance of the Funds. Investment income represents interest income and realized/unrealized gains and losses on investments in the products sponsored by us and third parties.\nAs of December 31, 2015, DFR Holdings LLC (\"DFR Holdings\") owned approximately 74% of the Company's outstanding shares (approximately 70% on a fully diluted basis).\nRecent Developments\nReorganization Transaction\nOn December 31, 2015, CIFC completed a series of transactions to change our top-level form of organization from a corporation to a limited liability company that is taxed as a partnership rather than a corporation for U.S. Federal income tax purposes and allows us to minimize entity-level taxation on investment income. These tax efficiencies may enable us to increase distributions to shareholders and/or investment in our business. As part of the Reorganization Transaction, CIFC Corp. distributed ownership of certain of its subsidiary entities holding certain investment assets to CIFC LLC and retained non-voting Series A Preferred Units (\"Preferred Units\") issued by certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of CIFC LLC (see Related Party Transactions below).\nEach share of common stock of CIFC Corp. outstanding immediately prior to the Reorganization Transaction was converted into the right to receive one common share representing a limited liability company interest in CIFC LLC. Further, CIFC LLC assumed all obligations under the CIFC Corp. 2011 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the \"Stock Incentive Plan\"). All the terms and conditions that were in effect immediately prior to the Reorganization Transaction under each outstanding equity award assumed by CIFC LLC will continue in full force and effect after the Reorganization Transaction, except that the interests issuable under each such award will be common shares of CIFC LLC instead of common stock of CIFC Corp.\nCIFC Corp. remains the issuer and primary obligor of our Junior Subordinated Notes and the Senior Notes (see below). Further, CIFC LLC and certain other subsidiaries of CIFC LLC have provided full and unconditional guarantees of the obligations of CIFC Corp. under the Junior Subordinated Notes and the Senior Notes.\nExecutive Overview\nThe past year proved to be the most challenging for the leveraged credit market since the end of the financial crisis. Commodity prices came under pressure over the summer and risk assets sold off starting in August. The U.S. High Yield Market was down 5% and the U.S. Corporate Loan market recorded its first negative total return since 2008.\nOur balance sheet investments in CIFC-managed funds outperformed their respective benchmarks. Both the Senior Secured Corporate Loan Fund and the Tactical Income Fund produced positive returns vis-\u00e0-vis losses in both the CS Loan Index and the LSTA Loan Index. The pronounced weakness in the CLO market led to a decline in mark-to-market valuation of our balance sheet CLO investments. Consequently, net investment income dropped to $1.9 million compared with $14.1 million in 2014. Excluding investment income, we increased ENI EBITDA by $7.2 million or 26% year-over-year.\nIn 2015, we were successful in sponsoring 5 new CLOs for a combined AUM of $2.6 billion. Strong equity sponsorship allowed us to issue all 5 transactions on a non-risk retention compliant basis. We are well capitalized to issue risk retention compliant CLOs. We successfully completed a 10-year $40 million senior unsecured bond offering in the fourth quarter to further bolster our capacity to invest in risk retention compliant CLOs. We have $210.4 million of cash and investments on our balance sheet, most of which will be available for risk retention compliance over the next 3 years.\nOur total return corporate credit loan business has outperformed the various leveraged loan indices (S&P LSTA, CS LL & JPM LL) since inception, for three consecutive years. We successfully launched three new funds; including our first white-labeled loan funds in Korea and Switzerland. The AUM of our credit fund platform now exceeds $1.0 billion. Our loan portfolios continue to perform well and defaults continue to be substantially lower compared to the loan indices. We have maintained our rigorous underwriting process and actively managed risk across well-diversified portfolios. We first started to cut our energy exposure in late August and early September of 2014 and continue to be defensively positioned. We remain underweight the sector with current exposure below 3%.\nCLO issuance has been slow during the course of the first two months of 2016. Forecasts from various banks expect market conditions to improve in the second half of the year. We are well positioned to access the market once conditions become more compelling. Loan prepayment rates have slowed significantly. We expect loan prepayment rates to remain lower until CLO new issuance volumes return, increasing the duration of our existing CLO AUM. We are taking advantage of lower loan prices to build par in our 2.0 CLOs. We expect the current investment opportunity to drive improved returns and with that, potentially higher incentive fees on our existing CLOs in the future.\nFee Earning AUM\nFee Earning AUM or AUM refers to the assets managed by the Company on which we receive management fees and/or incentive fees. Generally, with respect to CLOs, management fees are paid to the Company based on the aggregate collateral balance at par plus principal cash, and with respect to Non-CLO funds, the value of the assets in such funds. The following table summarizes Fee Earning AUM:\n\nExplanatory Notes:\n_________________________________\n (1) Fee Earning AUM attributable to ABS and Corporate Bond CDO products is expected to continue to decline as these funds run-off per their contractual terms. \n (2) Fee Earning AUM is based on the latest available monthly report issued by the trustee or fund administrator prior to the end of the period, and may not tie back to the Consolidated GAAP financial statements. \n (3) Legacy CLOs represent all managed CLOs issued prior to 2011, including CLOs acquired since 2011 but issued prior to 2011. \n (4) Management fees for Non-CLO products vary by fund and may not be similar to a CLO. \nFee Earning AUM activities are as follows:\n\nExplanatory Note:\n_________________________________\n(1) Includes changes in collateral balances of CLOs between periods and market value or portfolio value changes in certain Non-CLO products.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we sponsored the issuance of five new CLOs, launched four new funds and increased subscriptions to existing funds for an aggregate of $3.0 billion of new Fee Earning AUM. All CDOs and certain CLOs we manage have passed their reinvestment periods (see table below). Therefore, proceeds from paydowns are required to repay the CLO's or CDO's liabilities. As expected, AUM on these CLOs and CDOs continued to decline during the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition, 9 CLOs were called during 2015, which generated additional incentive fees. This, along with redemptions from other loan-based products, reduced AUM by $2.7 billion, resulting in an overall net increase in AUM of $0.3 billion.\nLoan-based AUM\nSince 2012, CIFC has raised $11.4 billion of new AUM through organic growth, which has more than offset the run-off from Legacy CLOs (including acquired CLOs). Our Legacy CLO AUM of $2.6 billion is less than a fifth of our total CLO AUM of $12.4 billion and we anticipate it will run off over the next three years.\nThe structure of the CLOs we manage affects the management fees paid to us. The following table summarizes select details of the structure of each of the CLOs we manage:\n\nExplanatory Notes:\n_________________________________\n (1) CLOs are generally callable by equity holders (or the subordinated note holders of the CLO) once per quarter beginning on the \"first optional call date\" and subject to satisfaction of certain conditions. \n (2) Termination of reinvestment period refers to the date after which we can no longer use certain principal collections to purchase additional collateral, and such collections are instead used to repay the outstanding amounts of certain debt securities issued by the CLO. \n (3) Represents the contractual maturity of the CLO. Generally, the actual maturity of the deal is expected to occur before the contractual maturity. \nResults of Consolidated Operations\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the financial statements of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, the entities in which we have a controlling interest (\"Consolidated Funds\") and variable interest entities (\"VIEs\" or \"Consolidated VIEs\") for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary (together with the Consolidated Funds, the \"Consolidated Entities\"). Consolidated VIEs includes certain CLOs and warehouses we manage.\nIn February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standard Update \"ASU\" 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810) - Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis (\"ASU 2015-02\"). The amendments changed the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. We elected to early adopt this guidance on a modified retroactive basis (as of January 1, 2015) (\"Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\"-Note 3). The adoption of ASU 2015-02 resulted in the deconsolidation of 30 CLOs and the Senior Secured Corporate Loan Fund on a modified retrospective basis on January 1, 2015. As of December 31, 2015 the Company consolidated 2 CLOs and 2 credit funds. Year over year, our Consolidated Statements of Operations will not be comparative for certain individual line items.\nThe following table presents our comparative Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\n\nTotal Net Revenues-GAAP net revenues include management and incentive fees from unconsolidated CLOs, CDOs and Non-CLO products and net investment income from investments in unconsolidated entities. Year-over-year total net revenues decreased significantly due to the deconsolidation of 30 CLOs and the Senior Secured Corporate Loan Fund as of January 1, 2015. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2015-02, revenues from these assets were eliminated in consolidation.\nTotal Expenses\nEmployee compensation and benefits-The increase primarily relates to contractual fee sharing arrangements which required the Company to pay certain former employees incentive fees collected on CLOs acquired from Columbus Nova Credit Investments Management, LLC (\"CNCIM\"). During 2015, we received higher incentive fees on such CLOs. The increase was partially offset by a reduction in incentive-based compensation compared to the prior year.\nShare based compensation-During 2015, we expensed a full year of amortization on 1.3 million of RSUs and 0.4 million of stock options granted during 2014. In addition, in 2015, we recognized additional expenses from the acceleration of vesting terms on certain restricted stock unit awards granted to the Company's Co-Presidents (\"Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\"-Note 12).\nProfessional fees-Year over year, professional fees increased primarily in relation to expenses incurred for the Reorganization Transaction and to support the growth and diversification of the business.\nGeneral and administrative expenses-In 2014, we recorded a $0.6 million expense for the settlement of litigation with a former employee.\nDepreciation and amortization-In 2015, we had lower amortization expense for intangible assets since these management contracts were either impaired or written off in the prior year.\nImpairments of intangible assets-During the year ended December 31, 2015, we received notice from holders of certain CLOs exercising their right to call those CLOs for redemption. As a result of these calls, we recorded impairment charges of $1.8 million to fully impair intangible assets associated with these management contracts.\nConsolidated Entities - Expenses and Interest Expenses-Year-over-year total expenses from the Consolidated Entities decreased significantly primarily due to the deconsolidation of 30 CLOs and the Senior Secured Corporate Loan Fund as of January 1, 2015. As of December 31, 2015 the Company consolidated 2 CLOs and 2 credit funds and as of December 31, 2014, we consolidated 31 CLOs, 1 warehouse, and 2 credit funds. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2015-02, expenses from these entities were eliminated in consolidation.\nNet other income (expense) and gain (loss)-Subsequent to the adoption of ASU 2015-02, we deconsolidated 30 CLOs and the Senior Secured Corporate Loan Fund on a modified retrospective basis on January 1, 2015. As such, the balances are not comparable year over year.\nNet gain (loss) on investment-Net gain (loss) on investment includes the unrealized appreciation or depreciation and realized gains and losses on the investments in CLOs, warehouses and credit funds which we are not required to consolidate. In general, the decrease primarily related to an increase in unrealized losses as a result of significant declines in the market value of loans and CLO securities compared to the prior year. See Non-GAAP Measures section for further discussion.\nNet (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in Consolidated Entities-Subsequent to the adoption of ASU 2015-02, we deconsolidated 30 CLOs and the Senior Secured Corporate Loan Fund on a modified retrospective basis on January 1, 2015. As such, the balances are not comparable year over year. As of December 31, 2015, we consolidated 2 CLOs and 2 credit funds, and as of December 31, 2014, we consolidated 31 CLOs, 1 warehouse, and 2 credit funds.\nIncome tax expense/benefit-CIFC's Provision for Taxes for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $25.2 million and $22.2 million, respectively. This resulted in an effective tax rate of 96.3% and 225.3%, respectively, based on our Income (loss) before income taxes of $26.2 million and $9.8 million, respectively.\nThe primary factor that contributed to the fluctuation in the effective tax rate is that pre-tax book income (loss) includes $0.6 million for 2015 and $(20.7) million for 2014 of income/(loss) from consolidated VIEs and VOEs. Income/(loss) from consolidated VIEs and VOEs is included in the pre-tax income/(loss) but is not included in the calculation of taxable income. The effective tax rate in 2015 and 2014 was impacted by the write-down of deferred tax assets of $6.3 million and $6.4 million, respectively, resulting from tax law changes enacted by New York City in 2015 and New York State in 2014. These tax law changes were effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015. The 2015 effective tax rate was further impacted by the reversal of the deferred tax assets in connection with the Reorganization Transaction (see \"Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\"-Note 15).\nWe expect a reduction in our effective tax rate going forward as the result of the Reorganization Transaction. Inclusion of consolidated VIEs and VOEs in the pretax income/(loss) is expected to continue to impact the effective tax rate for future years.\nENI and Deconsolidated Non-GAAP Statements (Non-GAAP Measures)\nENI and ENI EBITDA\nENI is a non-GAAP financial measure of profitability which management uses in addition to GAAP Net income (loss) attributable to CIFC LLC to measure the performance of our core business (excluding non-core products). We believe ENI reflects the nature and substance of the business, the economic results driven by management and incentive fee revenues from the management of client funds and earnings on our investments. ENI represents GAAP Net income (loss) attributable to CIFC LLC excluding (i) income taxes, (ii) merger and acquisition related items including fee-sharing arrangements, amortization and impairments of intangible assets and gain (loss) on contingent consideration for earn-outs, (iii) non-cash compensation related to profits interests granted by CIFC Parent Holdings LLC (\"CIFC Parent\") in June 2011, (iv) revenues attributable to non-core investment products, (v) advances for fund organizational expenses, and (vi) certain other items as detailed.\nENI EBITDA is also a non-GAAP financial measure that management considers, in addition to GAAP Net income (loss) attributable to CIFC LLC, to evaluate our core performance. ENI EBITDA represents ENI before corporate interest expense and depreciation of fixed assets, a non-cash item.\nENI and ENI EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies, as they are non-GAAP financial measures that are not based on a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and therefore may be defined differently by other companies. In addition, ENI and ENI EBITDA should be considered an addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table presents our components of ENI for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (1):\n\nExplanatory Notes:\n______________________________\n (1) Amounts in this table can be derived by taking the deconsolidated non-GAAP Statement of Operations and adjusting balances using the ENI reconciliation.  (2)Net investment income for the respective periods include: \n (3) GAAP weighted average shares outstanding was used as ENI weighted average shares outstanding. \nFor the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nAdjusted net revenues-Year over year incentive fees increased by $4.7 million or 27% as a result of increases in CLOs called during 2015. Further, since its launch in the fourth quarter of 2014, we recognized incentive fees for the first time from the Warehouse Fund. Management fees increased by $5.2 million or 9% as a result of increased AUM of credit funds year over year, and a full year of fees from CLOs issued in 2014. Net investment income decreased by $12.3 million or 87% related to an increase of $13.5 million in unrealized losses, as a result of significant declines in the market value of loans and CLO securities compared to the prior year.\nAdjusted expenses-Total adjusted expenses increased by $2.4 million or 5% primarily due to increases in adjusted Share based compensation and adjusted Professional fees. These increases were offset by decreases in adjusted Corporate interest expense and adjusted Employee compensation and benefits.\nAdjusted share based compensation increased as we recognized (i) a full year of amortization on equity awards granted during 2014 and (ii) additional expenses from the acceleration of vesting terms on certain restricted stock unit awards granted to the Company's Co-Presidents (\"Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\"-Note 12). Further, adjusted Professional fees increased to support the growth and diversification of the business. These increases were partially offset by the reduction of adjusted Corporate interest expense primarily related to the conversion of the Company's Convertible Notes in July 2014 and adjusted Employee compensation and benefits from a reduction in incentive-based compensation compared to the prior year.\nThe following is a reconciliation of GAAP Net income (loss) attributable to CIFC LLC to ENI:\n\nExplanatory Notes:\n______________________________\n (1) We share management fees on certain of the acquired CLOs we manage (shared with the party that sold the funds to CIFC, or an affiliate thereof). Management fees are presented on a gross basis for GAAP and on a net basis for ENI. \n (2) Employee compensation and benefits has been adjusted for non-cash compensation related to profits interests granted to CIFC employees by CIFC Parent and sharing of incentive fees with certain former employees established in connection with our acquisition of certain CLOs from CNCIM. \n (3) In 2015, Other predominately includes professional fees related to the Reorganization Transaction. \nDeconsolidated Non-GAAP Statements\nThe Deconsolidated Non-GAAP Statements represent the Consolidated GAAP statements adjusted to eliminate the impact of the Consolidated Entities. On the Consolidated Statement of Operations, we have reclassified the sum of Net results of Consolidated Entities, Net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in Consolidated Entities and Net gain (loss) on investments to the Deconsolidated Non-GAAP line items that represent its characteristics: management fees and incentive fees, and interest income. On the Balance Sheets, we have excluded amounts related to all consolidated entities. Management uses these Non-GAAP statements in addition to Consolidated GAAP Statements to measure the performance of our core asset management business.\nThe following table presents the reconciliation from CIFC LLC GAAP to Deconsolidated Non-GAAP Statement of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\n\nExplanatory Note:\n______________________________\n (1) On December 31, 2015, we completed the Reorganization Transaction to become a publicly traded limited liability company. For the year ended December 31, 2015, total Net income (loss) was attributable to CIFC Corp., and effective December 31, 2015, Net income (loss) is attributable to CIFC LLC. \nThe following table presents the reconciliation from CIFC LLC GAAP to Deconsolidated Non-GAAP Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2015 and 2014:\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur operating cash flows are composed of revenues from management fees, incentive fees and investment income net of compensation expense, general and administrative expense and income taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2015, our primary use of cash included $56.9 million of net investments, primarily in CLO equity and debt. As of December 31, 2015, we held total Deconsolidated Non-GAAP cash and investments of $210.4 million composed of cash of $58.0 million and investments of $152.4 million with no debt maturing until October 2025.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we issued $40.0 million of Senior Notes, made distributions to our shareholders of $10.1 million, paid down contingent liabilities (related to fee sharing arrangements) of $3.6 million and repurchased treasury shares for $1.2 million.\nThe table below is a reconciliation of selected cash flows data for the year ended December 31, 2015 from GAAP to Non-GAAP:\n\nOur investments as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 are as follows ($ in thousands):\n\nExplanatory Notes:\n________________________________\n (1) Pursuant to GAAP, investments in consolidated CLOs, warehouses and certain Non-CLO products are eliminated from \"Investments\" on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. \n (2) From time to time, we establish warehouses,\u201d entities designed to accumulate assets in advance of sponsoring new CLOs or other funds managed by us. To establish a warehouse, we contribute equity capital to a newly formed entity which is typically levered (three to five times) and begins accumulating assets. When the related CLO or fund is sponsored, typically three to nine months later, the warehouse is terminated,\u201d with it concurrently repaying the related financing and returning to CIFC our equity contribution, net of gains and losses, if any. Starting in the fourth quarter of 2014, most warehouse investments that we manage have been made through the Warehouse Fund, a closed-end structured credit fund. \n (3) Primarily includes investment in CIFC's Tactical Income Fund, which may be redeemed with 60 day's notice on the last day of each calendar quarter. \nOther Sources and Uses of Funds\nLong-Term Debt-The following table summarizes the long-term debt of CIFC LLC and CIFC Corp. (1):\n\nExplanatory Notes:\n________________________________\n (1) As a result of the Reorganization Transaction (see Related Parties below), CIFC Corp. made a non-cash distribution in kind of certain of its subsidiary entities holding certain investment assets (e.g. investments in CLOs and Funds) to CIFC LLC. As such, as of December 31, 2015, CIFC Corp. did not consolidate any CLOs. \n (2) Pursuant to the adoption of ASU 2015-03, the carrying values of recourse debt has been presented net of debt issuance costs. \n (3) March Junior Subordinated Notes bear interest at an annual rate of three month LIBOR plus 2.58% until maturity on October 30, 2035. Prior to April 30, 2015, these notes bore interest at an annual rate of 1%. \n (4) October Junior Subordinated Notes bear interest at an annual rate of three month LIBOR plus 3.50% and mature on October 30, 2035. \n (5) The Senior Notes bear interest at 8.5% and mature on October 30, 2025. \n (6) Pursuant to the adoption of ASU 2014-13, Long-term debt of the Consolidated CLOs has been remeasured in accordance with the new guidance (\"Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\"-Notes 3 and 5). The subordinated notes of the Consolidated CLOs do not have a stated interest rate and have been excluded from the calculation of the weighted average borrowing rate. As of December 31, 2015, long-term debt of the Consolidated CLOs includes $153.1 million of other investment products. \n (7) Long-term debt of warehouses not held by the Company is recorded at fair value. The fair value excludes the preferred shares of warehouses not held by the Company. As warehouses are generally terminated before the end of their terms, they are excluded from the calculation of the weighted average remaining maturity. \nCovenants-Junior Subordinated Notes-The Junior Subordinated Notes contain certain restrictive covenants including a restricted payments covenant that restricts our ability to pay dividends or make distributions in respect of our equity securities, subject to a number of exceptions and conditions. These covenants also limit CIFC Corp.'s ability to make distributions to its related parties, including CIFC LLC.\nCovenants-Senior Notes-On November 2, 2015, CIFC Corp. issued $40.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 8.5% unsecured senior notes due October 30, 2025 (the Senior Notes\u201d) and guaranteed by CIFC LLC and certain subsidiaries. Under the terms of the related indenture, certain consolidated entities such as consolidated CLOs, Warehouses and Funds (\"Investment Vehicles\") do not guarantee the notes. Further, the indenture provides that entities holding at least 90% of the Company's consolidated total assets are guarantors. The Company may designate entities within its corporate structure as non-guarantor entities (\"Unrestricted Entities\" and together with Investment Vehicles, \"Non-Guarantor\"). The Senior Notes indenture includes certain restrictive covenants including a restricted payments covenant that restricts the Company's ability to pay dividends or make distributions in respect of our equity securities, subject to a number of exceptions and conditions.\nPrior to October 30, 2020 (the \"Non-call Date\"), we, at our option, may redeem all or a portion of the notes subject at a redemption price equal to (i) the principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus (ii) accrued and unpaid interest through the date of redemption plus (iii) a make whole payment. Any time on and after October 30, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 and thereafter, we, at our option, may redeem, all or a portion of the notes at a redemption price equal to 104.250%, 102.834%, 101.417%, or 100.000%, respectively, of the aggregate principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. Further, upon a change of control event, as defined by the indenture, the issuer must offer to repurchase the notes at 101%.\nTotal debt issuance costs related to the issuance of the Senior Notes of $2.1 million was capitalized and recorded as a contra liability, resulting in a reduction of the total principal balance. Debt issuance costs are amortized over the term of the notes. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded an aggregate interest expense of $0.5 million related to these notes.\nLease Commitments-The future minimum commitments under our lease agreement are as follows:\n\nConsolidated VIEs-Although we consolidate all the assets and liabilities of the Consolidated VIEs (including the Consolidated CLOs, warehouses and other investment products), our maximum exposure to loss is limited to our investments and beneficial interests in the Consolidated VIEs and the receivables of management fees from the Consolidated VIEs. All of these items are eliminated upon consolidation. The assets of each of the Consolidated VIEs are administered by the trustee of each fund solely as collateral to satisfy the obligations of the Consolidated VIEs. If we were to liquidate, the assets of the Consolidated VIEs would not be available to our general creditors, and as a result, we do not consider them our assets. Additionally, the investors in the debt and residual interests of the Consolidated VIEs have no recourse to our general assets. Therefore, this debt is not our obligation.\nRelated Party Transactions\nDFR Holdings-As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, DFR Holdings owned approximately 18.8 million of the Company's shares. Accordingly, DFR Holdings received quarterly distributions from CIFC (\"Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\"-Note 12). In addition, the DFR Warrants provide DFR Holdings the right to purchase 2.0 million of the Company's voting common shares which were scheduled to expire on September 24, 2015. On September 24, 2015, the terms of the warrants were extended to January 24, 2017 in exchange for cash of $0.4 million (\"Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\"-Note 12).\nIn August 2014, we entered into a consulting agreement with DFR Holdings whereby DFR Holdings agreed to provide CIFC with ongoing advisory services such as the participation in financial, tax and strategic planning/budgeting, investor interface, new product initiatives, fund raising and recruiting. During both the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we expensed $2.0 million in connection with the consulting agreement.\nIn addition, pursuant to the Third Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement with DFR Holdings dated December 2, 2013, the Company agreed to nominate to the Board six directors designated by DFR Holdings (the \"DFR Designees\"). The number of directors that can be designated by DFR Holdings will be reduced in the event that DFR Holdings decreases its ownership (on a diluted basis) in CIFC. If DFR Holdings' ownership falls below 5%, it will lose the right to designate any director. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the DFR Designees earned an aggregate $0.7 million and $0.8 million, respectively, related to their services as directors of CIFC.\nRelated party transactions in 2014 included $1.9 million of interest expense paid to DFR Holdings on the Convertible Notes which were subsequently converted into 4,132,231 shares.\nOther-As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, a board member held $1.0 million of income notes in one of the Company's sponsored CLOs, CIFC Funding 2013-II, Ltd., through an entity in which he is a 50% equity holder.\nFunds-All CIFC general partner's investments in credit funds are related party transactions (\"Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\"- Note 2). As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, key employees and directors of CIFC (including related entities) invested an aggregate of $4.7 million in four CIFC managed funds. Key employees are not charged management or incentive fees, where applicable, on their investment. Directors were charged management and/or incentive fees, where applicable, similar to certain other investors. For all periods presented in 2015 and 2014, these fees were de minimis.\nInvestment in Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries of CIFC LLC-As part of the Reorganization Transaction, CIFC Corp. made a non-cash distribution in kind of certain of its subsidiary entities holding certain investment assets (e.g. investments in CLOs and Funds) to other wholly-owned subsidiaries of CIFC LLC. CIFC Corp. (i) made a non-cash distribution in kind of $110.0 million (of which $42.0 million was cash held by CIFC Corp.) and (ii) retained 85,000 non-voting Series A Preferred Units (\"Preferred Units\") issued by certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of CIFC LLC with a par value of $85.0 million. The Preferred Units will pay annual distributions of 3.5%, must be redeemed or retired by January 29, 2026, and at the election of the holder, are callable four years after issuance at par plus accrued and unpaid distributions. As of December 31, 2015, CIFC Corp.'s investment in the Preferred Units was reported in \"Investment in wholly-owned subsidiaries of CIFC LLC\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheet of CIFC Corp. This is an intercompany transaction and has been eliminated upon consolidation of CIFC LLC's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSenior Notes-During 2015, CIFC Corp. issued $40.0 million of Senior Notes which were fully and unconditionally guaranteed by CIFC LLC and certain subsidiaries (\"Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\"-Note 18).\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we did not maintain any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance, special purpose or VIEs, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Further, as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we did not guarantee any obligations of unconsolidated entities, enter into any commitments or express intent to provide additional funding to any such entities.\nSubsequent Events\nSubsequent to year end, our Board declared an aggregate cash distribution of $0.34 per share; composed of a quarterly cash distribution of $0.10 per share and a special distribution of $0.24 per share issued in order to defray a portion of the U.S. Federal income tax liability of shareholders arising from the Reorganization Transaction. The distribution will be paid on April 15, 2016 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on April 1, 2016.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur significant accounting policies are disclosed in Item 8 - \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\"-Note 3. Our most critical accounting policies involve judgments and estimates that could affect our reported assets and liabilities, as well as our reported revenues and expenses. These accounting policies and estimates are discussed below. We believe that all of the judgments and estimates inherent in our financial statements were reasonable as of the date thereof, based upon information available to us at the time. We rely on management's experience and analysis of historical and current market data in order to arrive at what we believe to be reasonable estimates. Under varying conditions, we could report materially different amounts arising under these critical accounting policies.\nFair Value Measurements and Presentation-The degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market parameters. For financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that trade actively and have quoted market prices or observable market parameters, there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value. When observable market prices and parameters are not fully available, management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value. In addition, changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data. For example, reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable. Therefore, when market data is not available, we would use valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value measurement.\nSee \"Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\"-Notes 3 and 5 for a complete discussion on how we determine the fair value of financial and non-financial assets and financial liabilities and the related measurement techniques and estimates involved.\nVariable Interest Entities- In February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued ASU 2015-02. The amendments changed the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. We adopted this guidance on a modified retroactive basis as of January 1, 2015 (\"Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\"-Note 3).\nAssessing if an entity is a variable interest entity and if we are the primary beneficiary (\"PB\") involves judgment and analysis on a structure-by-structure basis. Generally, we determine whether we are the PB of a VIE through a qualitative assessment; however, when deemed necessary, a quantitative assessment may also be performed. This consolidation assessment is performed upon inception of the relationship and reconsidered on an ongoing basis. In the PB determination for CLOs, to determine significance, we evaluated our right to receive and obligation to absorb the VIEs' expected future gains and losses. The expected future gains and losses of the VIEs are determined based on internally developed discounted cash flow models that utilize both observable and unobservable inputs. Significant inputs to the models include the structure of the VIEs and estimates related to loan default rates, recovery rates, projected call dates, prepayment rates and discount rates. In the PB determination for warehouses, we consolidate warehouses when (i) our investment management services meet the power criteria and when (ii) we have contributed significant equity providing us with the right to receive potentially significant gains and the obligation to absorb potentially significant losses of the warehouse (the economic criteria).\nBusiness Combinations-We are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values. The estimates used to determine the fair value of long-lived assets, such as intangible assets, can be complex and require significant judgments. We use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation firms, when necessary, to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired long-lived assets. This includes estimates and judgments as to the expectations of future cash flows of the acquired business, the allocation of these cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, and the estimated useful lives of intangible assets. If actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates, this could result in possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill or require acceleration of the amortization expense of intangible assets with finite lives. We periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate. Contingent consideration for business combinations and contingent liabilities assumed in business combinations are remeasured at fair value at each reporting date with changes in fair value recorded within net gain (loss) on investments, loans, derivatives and liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nGoodwill-Goodwill represents the excess cost of a business combination over the fair value of the net assets acquired. We review goodwill periodically, at least on an annual basis, considering factors such as our projected cash flows and revenues and earnings multiples of comparable companies, to determine whether the carrying value of goodwill is impaired. If goodwill is deemed to be impaired, the difference between the carrying amount reflected in the financial statements and the estimated fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs. We have one reporting unit for which goodwill is tested for impairment. In evaluating the recoverability of goodwill, we derive the fair value of our reporting unit utilizing both the income and market approaches. Under the income approach, we make various assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair value of the reporting unit. Under the market approach, we determine the fair value of the reporting unit based on multiples of EBITDA of comparable publicly-traded companies.\nWe must make various assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair value of the reporting unit. Key assumptions used in the income approach include, but are not limited to, the discount rate, revenue growth rates over the next five years and the terminal growth rate. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, or if we change our reporting structure, we may be required to record impairment charges. A portion or all of goodwill may become impaired in future periods if we are not successful in achieving our expected cash flow levels, if global economic conditions deteriorate from current levels or if other events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable.\nWe completed our annual impairment reviews for 2015 and 2014 and determined that the goodwill recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet was not impaired. The underlying assumptions and estimates used in the impairment test are made as of a point in time (the date of our goodwill impairment test). Subsequent changes in these assumptions and estimates could change the result of the impairment test. Based on the reviews performed for 2015 and 2014, we concluded that our sole reporting unit had an estimated fair value in excess of carrying value. If our reporting unit's expected revenue growth over the next five years falls below our current expected growth rate, a portion or all of our goodwill may be impaired in future periods.\nIntangible Assets-Intangible assets are comprised of assets with finite lives acquired in a business combination. The largest component of our intangible assets are those associated with the CLO investment management contracts. The intangible assets associated with CLO investment management contracts are amortized over their useful lives, either on a straight line basis or based on a ratio of expected discounted cash flows of the contracts. We consider our own assumptions in the underlying management fee projections which include the structure of the CLOs and estimates related to loan default rates, recoveries and discount rates. A change in those projections could have a significant impact on our amortization expense.\nIntangible assets with finite lives are tested for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment charge is recorded if the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value. Impairment testing for the intangible assets associated with our CLO investment management\ncontracts includes a comparison of the estimated remaining undiscounted cash flows related to those CLO management contracts to the carrying value of the intangible asset. If the carrying value of the intangible asset is less than the estimated remaining undiscounted cash flows, no further testing is performed, and the intangible asset is not deemed impaired. If the carrying value of the intangible asset is greater than the estimated remaining undiscounted cash flows, then further analysis is performed to determine if the asset is impaired, including an analysis of the estimated remaining discounted cash flows.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we received notices from holders of certain CLOs exercising their rights to call the CLOs for redemption. As a result of these calls, we recorded a $1.8 million expense to fully impair the intangible assets associated with these management contracts.\nIncome Taxes-CIFC LLC is a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and is not subject to U.S. income taxes. CIFC Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company is subject to federal, state and local corporate income taxes at the entity level and the related tax provisions are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCurrent federal income taxes are recognized based on amounts estimated to be payable or recoverable as a result of taxable operations for the current year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future income tax consequences (temporary differences) attributable to the difference between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective income tax basis using tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period when the change is enacted. When evaluating the realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider, among other matters, estimates of expected future taxable income, nature of current and cumulative losses, existing and projected book/tax differences, and forecasts of our business operations. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\nNet deferred tax assets have been recognized based on management's belief that taxable income of the appropriate character, more likely than not, will be sufficient to realize the benefits of these assets over time. In the event that actual results differ from our expectations, we may be required to record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, which may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe record uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740 on the basis of a two-step process whereby (1) we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority.\nRecent Accounting Updates\nFor a discussion of the impact of new accounting pronouncements on our financial condition or results of operations, see \"Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\"-Note 3.

forward-looking statements that are based on industry outlook and company expectations for future performance but are subject to risks and uncertainties. \n\nCIFC LLC is a publicly traded Delaware limited liability company based in New York City specializing in secured U.S. corporate loans. It went through a reorganization at the end of 2015 that allowed it to operate with more tax efficiency and potentially increase shareholder distributions and investment in business. \n\nThe company's AUM is mostly composed of CLOs, with a focus on generating income and capital appreciation through investments predominantly in senior secured corporate loans (SSCLs). Revenue comes from management fees, incentive fees, and investment income.\n\nAs of December 31, 2015, DFR Holdings LLC owned a significant portion of the company's shares.\n\nRecent market conditions have been the most challenging since the financial crisis, with declines in the high yield and corporate loan markets. Despite this, CIFC's balance sheet investments outperformed benchmarks, with positive returns from certain funds.\n\nIn 2015, CIFC sponsored five new CLOs and successfully launched several new funds, bringing the AUM of its credit fund platform over $1.0 billion. The company remains well-capitalized, with a healthy balance of cash and investments to support future obligations and growth.\n\nLooking forward, projections for CLO issuance in 2016 are tentative, with banks forecasting improvement in the latter half of the year. CIFC is actively managing its portfolios to optimize performance and prepare for better market conditions.\n\nThe fee earning AUM consists of CLOs, credit funds, and other loan-based products, which have seen both increases and reductions throughout the year, leading to a net increase in overall AUM.\n\nCIFC has detailed its financial performance, including revenues and expenses for 2015 in comparison to 2014, which reflects the significant impact of deconsolidation of entities, ASU adoption, and reorganization activities. \n\nMoreover, information regarding the management of various funds and the structure of the company\u2019s CLOs is provided. More detailed financial statements have been included in the report with additional notes explaining specific items such as fee earning AUM and certain balance changes.\n\nRegarding liquidity and capital resources, the company reported on its long-term debt, lease commitments, consolidated VIEs, related party transactions, and off-balance sheet arrangements.\n\nIn terms of critical accounting policies, the report discusses fair value measurements, estimates for business combinations and goodwill, intangible assets, and income taxes. There are also notes on recent accounting updates.\n\nA series of recent events including a cash distribution to shareholders and strategic transactions are also mentioned. The company outlines a cautious but determined approach to weathering challenging market conditions and leveraging opportunities for future growth.\n\nLastly, detailed footnotes and sections highlight additional information on items such as accounting policies, consolidation adjustments, and reconciliation of long-term debt and capital structures."}
