Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto of DNO included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nForward-Looking Information\nThis annual report on Form 10-K, including this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d contains forward-looking statements regarding the plans and objectives of management for future operations. This information may involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause DNO's actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements, which involve assumptions and describe DNO's future plans, strategies and expectations, are generally identifiable by use of the words may,\u201d will,\u201d should,\u201d expect,\u201d anticipate,\u201d estimate,\u201d believe,\u201d intend\u201d or project,\u201d the negative of these words, other variations on these words or comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that may be incorrect, and DNO cannot assure investors that the projections included in these forward-looking statements will come to pass. DNO's actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors.\nDNO has based the forward-looking statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K on information available to it on the date of this annual report on Form 10-K, and DNO assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Although DNO undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, investors are advised to consult any additional disclosures that DNO may make directly to them or through reports that DNO in the future files with the SEC, including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.\nIntroduction\nDNO, a Delaware limited partnership, is a commodity pool that issues shares that may be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca. The investment objective of DNO is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares' per share NAV to inversely reflect the daily changes, in percentage terms, of the spot price of WTI light, sweet crude oil delivered to Cushing, Oklahoma, as measured by the daily changes in the price of the futures contract for WTI light, sweet crude oil traded on the NYMEX that is the near month contract to expire, except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, in which case it will be measured by the futures contract that is the next month contract to expire (the Benchmark Futures Contract\u201d), less DNO's expenses. Near month contract\u201d means the next contract traded on the NYMEX due to expire. Next month contract\u201d means the first contract traded on the NYMEX due to expire after the near month contract.\nDNO's investment objective is not for its NAV or market price of shares to equal, in dollar terms, the inverse of the spot price of WTI light, sweet crude oil or any particular futures contract based on WTI light, sweet crude oil, nor is DNO's investment objective for the percentage change in its NAV to reflect the inverse of the percentage change of the price of any particular futures contract as measured over a time period greater than one day. USCF believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in Futures Contracts and Other Crude Oil-Related Investments.\nDNO seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing so that the average daily percentage change in DNO's NAV for any period of 30 successive valuation days will be within plus/minus ten percent (10%) of the inverse of the average daily percentage change in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract over the same period.\nThe regulation of commodity interest trading in the United States and other countries is an evolving area of the law. The various statements made in this summary are subject to modification by legislative action and changes in the rules and regulations of the SEC, FINRA, CFTC, the NFA, the futures exchanges, clearing organizations and other regulatory bodies. Pending final resolution of all applicable regulatory requirements, some examples of how new rules and regulations could impact DNO are discussed in Item 1. Business\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>41 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPrice Movements\nCrude oil futures prices were volatile during the year ended December 31, 2017 and exhibited moderate daily swings along with an uneven upward trend during the year. The price of the Benchmark Futures Contract started the year at $53.720 per barrel. The high of the year was on December 29, 2017 when the price reached $60.420 per barrel. The low of the year was on June 21, 2017 when the price dropped to $42.530 per barrel. The year ended with the Benchmark Futures Contract at $60.420 per barrel, an increase of approximately 12.47% over the year. DNO's per share NAV began the year at $61.96 and ended the year at $56.56 on December 31, 2017, a decrease of approximately (8.72)% over the year. DNO's per share NAV reached its high for the year on June 21, 2017 at $80.19 and reached its low for the year on December 29, 2017 at $56.56. Since DNO's investment objective is to track the inverse of the daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract, the decrease in DNO's per share NAV reflects the inverse of the increase in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract. The Benchmark Futures Contract prices listed above began with the February 2017 contracts and ended with the February 2018 contracts. The increase of approximately 12.47% on the Benchmark Futures Contract listed above is a hypothetical return only and could not actually be achieved by an investor holding Futures Contracts. An investment in Futures Contracts would need to be rolled forward during the time period described in order to simulate such a result. Furthermore, the change in the nominal price of these differing Futures Contracts, measured from the start of the year to the end of the year, does not represent the actual benchmark results that DNO seeks to track, which are more fully described below in the section titled Tracking DNO's Benchmark.\u201d\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the crude oil futures market was in a state of contango, meaning that the price of the near month crude Oil Futures Contract was lower than the price of the next month crude Oil Futures Contract, or contracts further away from expiration. On days when the market is in backwardation, the price of the near month crude Oil Futures Contract is typically higher than the price of the next month crude Oil Futures Contract or contracts further away from expiration. For a discussion of the impact of backwardation and contango on total returns, see Term Structure of Crude Oil Prices and the Impact on Total Returns\u201d below.\nValuation of Futures Contracts and the Computation of the Per Share NAV\nThe per share NAV of DNO's shares is calculated once each NYSE Arca trading day. The per share NAV for a particular trading day is released after 4:00 p.m. New York time. Trading during the core trading session on the NYSE Arca typically closes at 4:00 p.m. New York time. The Administrator uses the NYMEX closing price (determined at the earlier of the close of the NYMEX or 2:30 p.m. New York time) for the contracts held on the NYMEX, but calculates or determines the value of all other DNO investments, including ICE Futures contracts or other futures contracts, as of the earlier of the close of the NYSE Arca or 4:00 p.m. New York time.\nResults of Operations and the Crude Oil Market\nResults of Operations. On September 24, 2009, DNO listed its shares on the NYSE Arca under the ticker symbol DNO.\u201d On that day, DNO established its initial offering price at $50.00 per share and issued 200,000 shares to the initial Authorized Participant, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., in exchange for $10,000,000 in cash.\nSince its initial offering of 25,000,000 shares, DNO has not registered any subsequent offerings of its shares. As of December 31, 2017, DNO had issued 4,200,000 shares, 200,000 of which were outstanding. As of December 31, 2017, there were 20,800,000 shares registered but not yet issued.\nMore shares may have been issued by DNO than are outstanding due to the redemption of shares. Unlike funds that are registered under the 1940 Act, shares that have been redeemed by DNO cannot be resold by DNO. As a result, DNO contemplates that additional offerings of its shares will be registered with the SEC in the future in anticipation of additional issuances and redemptions.\nAs of December 31, 2017, DNO had the following Authorized Participants: BNP Paribas Prime Brokerage, Inc., BNP Paribas Securities Corp., Citadel Securities LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Credit Suisse Securities USA LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Goldman Sachs & Company, JP Morgan Securities Inc., Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corporation, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Nomura Securities International Inc., RBC Capital Markets LLC, SG Americas Securities LLC, UBS Securities LLC and Virtu Financial BD LLC.\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>42 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016; and for the Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to the Year Ended December 31,\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Per share net asset value, end of period </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>56.56 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>61.96 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>81.25 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Average daily total net assets </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,484,809 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,980,695 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,702,689 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Dividend and interest income earned on Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>81,805 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50,150 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,690 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Annualized yield based on average daily total net assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.78 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.30 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.05 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Management fee </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>62,909 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>101,884 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>124,216 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total fees and other expenses excluding management fees </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>100,491 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>154,552 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>140,970 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total amount of the expense waiver </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>84,752 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>129,082 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>109,915 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Expenses before allowance for the expense waiver </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>163,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>256,436 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>265,186 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Expenses after allowance for the expense waiver </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>78,648 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>127,354 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>155,271 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total commissions accrued to brokers </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,960 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50,645 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>51,218 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total commissions as annualized percentage of average total net assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.20 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.30 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.25 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commissions accrued as a result of rebalancing </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,774 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,839 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>48,836 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Percentage of commissions accrued as a result of rebalancing </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>94.34 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>98.41 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>95.35 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commissions accrued as a result of creation and redemption activity </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,186 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>806 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,382 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Percentage of commissions accrued as a result of creation and redemption activity </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.66 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.59 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.65 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPortfolio Expenses. DNO's expenses consist of investment management fees, brokerage fees and commissions, certain offering costs, licensing fees, registration fees, the fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF and expenses relating to tax accounting and reporting requirements. The management fee that DNO pays to USCF is calculated as a percentage of the total net assets of DNO. The fee is accrued daily and paid monthly.\nThe decrease in the per share NAV for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, was due primarily to higher prices for crude oil and the related decrease in the value of the crude oil futures contracts in which DNO held and traded; and the decrease in the per share NAV for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, was due primarily to higher prices for crude oil and the related decrease in the value of the crude oil futures contracts in which DNO held and traded.\nAverage interest rates earned on short-term investments held by DNO, including cash, cash equivalents and Treasuries, were higher during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016; and were higher during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. As a result, the amount of income earned by DNO as a percentage of average daily total net assets was higher during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016; and was higher during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. To the degree that the aggregate yield is higher, the net expense ratio, inclusive of income, will be lower.\nThe decrease in total fees and other expenses excluding management fees for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 was due primarily to DNO's smaller size as measured by total net assets and lower professional fees; and the increase in total fees and other expenses excluding management fees for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, was due primarily to higher professional fees.\nThe decrease in total commissions accrued to brokers for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, was due primarily to a lower number of futures contracts being held and traded; and the decrease in total commissions accrued to brokers for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, was due primarily to lower number of futures contracts being held and traded.\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>43 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Three Months Ended December 31, 2016;

As a result, the amount of income earned by DNO as a percentage of average daily total net assets was higher during the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016; and was higher during the three months ended December 31, 2016 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2015.

Specifically, USCF seeks to manage the portfolio such that over any rolling period of 30-valuation days, the average daily change in DNO's per share NAV is within a range of (90)% to (110)% ((0.9) to (1.1)) of the average daily change in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract. As an example, if the average daily movement of the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract for a particular 30-valuation day time period was 0.50% per day, USCF would attempt to manage the portfolio such that the average daily movement of the per share NAV during that same time period fell between (0.45)% and (0.55)% (i.e., between (0.9) and (1.1) of the benchmark's results). DNO's portfolio management goals do not include trying to make the nominal price of DNO's per share NAV equal to the inverse of the nominal price of the current Benchmark Futures Contract or the inverse of the spot price for WTI light, sweet crude oil. USCF believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in short positions in Futures Contracts and Other Crude Oil-Related Investments.\nFor the 30-valuation days ended December 31, 2017, the inverse of the simple average daily change in the Benchmark Futures Contract was (0.286)%, while the simple average daily change in the per share NAV of DNO over the same time period was (0.285)%. The average daily difference was 0.001% (or 0.1 basis points, where 1 basis point equals 1/100 of 1%). As a percentage of the inverse of the daily movement of the Benchmark Futures Contract, the average error in daily tracking by the per share NAV was 0.408%, meaning that over this time period DNO's tracking error was within the plus or minus 10% range established as its benchmark tracking goal. The first chart below shows the daily movement of DNO's per share NAV versus the daily movement of the Benchmark Futures Contract for the 30-valuation day period ended December 31, 2017, the last trading day in December. The second chart below shows the monthly total returns of DNO as compared to the monthly value of the Benchmark Futures Contract for the five years ended December 31, 2017.\nSince the commencement of the offering of DNO's shares to the public on September 24, 2009 to December 31, 2017, the inverse of the simple average daily change in the Benchmark Futures Contract was 0.029%, while the simple average daily change in the per share NAV of DNO over the same time period was 0.026%. The average daily difference was (0.003)% (or (0.3) basis points, where 1 basis point equals 1/100 of 1%). As a percentage of the inverse of the daily movement of the Benchmark Futures Contract, the average error in daily tracking by the per share NAV was (0.844)%, meaning that over this time period DNO's tracking error was within the plus or minus 10% range established as its benchmark tracking goal.\n*PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS\n*PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>45 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAn alternative tracking measurement of the return performance of DNO versus the inverse of the return of its Benchmark Futures Contract can be calculated by comparing the actual return of DNO, measured by changes in its per share NAV, versus the expected changes in its per share NAV under the assumption that DNO's returns had been exactly the same as inverse to the daily changes in its Benchmark Futures Contract.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the actual total return of DNO as measured by changes in its per share NAV was (8.72)%. This is based on an initial per share NAV of $61.96 as of December 31, 2016 and an ending per share NAV as of December 31, 2017 of $56.56. During this time period, DNO made no distributions to its shareholders. However, if DNO's daily changes in its per share NAV had instead exactly inversely tracked the changes in the daily total return of the Benchmark Futures Contract, DNO would have had an estimated per share NAV of $56.54 as of December 31, 2017, for a total return over the relevant time period of (8.75)%. The difference between the actual per share NAV total return of DNO of (8.72)% and the expected total return based on the inverse of changes in the daily return of the Benchmark Futures Contract of (8.75)% was an error over the time period of 0.03%, which is to say that DNO's actual total return outperformed the inverse of the benchmark result by that percentage. DNO incurs expenses primarily composed of the management fee, brokerage commissions for the buying and selling of futures contracts, and other expenses. The impact of these expenses, offset by interest and dividend income, and net of positive or negative execution, tends to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of DNO to track slightly lower than the inverse of the daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.\nBy comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2016, the actual total return of DNO as measured by changes in its per share NAV was (23.74)%. This was based on an initial per share NAV of $81.25 as of December 31, 2015 and an ending per share NAV as of December 31, 2016 of $61.96. During this time period, DNO made no distributions to its shareholders. However, if DNO's daily changes in its per share NAV had instead exactly inversely tracked the changes in the daily total return of the Benchmark Futures Contract, DNO would have had an estimated per share NAV of $62.16 as of December 31, 2016, for a total return over the relevant time period of (23.50)%. The difference between the actual per share NAV total return of DNO of (23.74)% and the expected total return based on the inverse of changes in the daily return of the Benchmark Futures Contract of (23.50)% was an error over the time period of (0.24)%, which is to say that DNO's actual total return underperformed the inverse of the benchmark result by that percentage. DNO incurs expenses primarily composed of the management fee, brokerage commissions for the buying and selling of futures contracts, and other expenses. The impact of these expenses, offset by interest and dividend income, and net of positive or negative execution, tended to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of DNO to track slightly lower than the inverse of the daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.\nBy comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2015, the actual total return of DNO as measured by changes in its per share NAV was 45.92%. This was based on an initial per share NAV of $55.68 on December 31, 2014 and an ending per share NAV as of December 31, 2015 of $81.25. During this time period, DNO made no distributions to its shareholders. However, if DNO's daily changes in its per share NAV had instead exactly inversely tracked the changes in the daily total return of the Benchmark Futures Contract, DNO would have had an estimated per share NAV of $81.68 as of December 31, 2015, for a total return over the relevant time period of 46.70%. The difference between the actual per share NAV total return of DNO of 45.92% and the expected total return based on the inverse of changes in the daily return of the Benchmark Futures Contract of 46.70% was an error over the time period of (0.78)%, which is to say that DNO's actual total return underperformed the inverse of the benchmark result by that percentage. DNO incurs expenses primarily composed of the management fee, brokerage commissions for the buying and selling of futures contracts, and other expenses. The impact of these expenses, offset by interest and dividend income, and net of positive or negative execution, tended to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of DNO to track slightly lower than the inverse of the daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.\nThere are currently three factors that have impacted or are most likely to impact DNO's ability to accurately inversely track its Benchmark Futures Contract.\nFirst, DNO may buy or sell its holdings in the then current Benchmark Futures Contract at a price other than the closing settlement price of that contract on the day during which DNO executes the trade. In that case, DNO may pay a price that is higher, or lower, than that of the Benchmark Futures Contract, which could cause the changes in the daily per share NAV of DNO to either be too high or too low relative to the inverse of the daily changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract. During the year ended December 31, 2017, USCF attempted to minimize the effect of these transactions by seeking to execute its purchase or sale of the Benchmark Futures Contract at, or as close as possible to, the end of the day settlement price. However, it may not always be possible for DNO to obtain the closing settlement price and there is no assurance that failure to obtain the closing settlement price in the future will not adversely impact DNO's attempt to inversely track the Benchmark Futures Contract over time.\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>46 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSecond, DNO incurs expenses primarily composed of the management fee, brokerage commissions for the buying and selling of futures contracts, and other expenses. The impact of these expenses tends to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of DNO to track slightly lower than the inverse of daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract. At the same time, DNO earns dividend and interest income on its cash, cash equivalents and Treasuries. DNO is not required to distribute any portion of its income to its shareholders and did not make any distributions to shareholders during the year ended December 31, 2017. Interest payments, and any other income, were retained within the portfolio and added to DNO's NAV. When this income exceeds the level of DNO's expenses for its management fee, brokerage commissions and other expenses (including ongoing registration fees, licensing fees and the fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF), DNO will realize a net yield that will tend to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of DNO to track slightly higher than the inverse of daily changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract. If short-term interest rates rise above the current levels, the level of deviation created by the yield would decrease. Conversely, if short-term interest rates were to decline, the amount of error created by the yield would increase. When short-term yields drop to a level lower than the combined expenses of the management fee and the brokerage commissions, then the tracking error becomes a negative number and would tend to cause the daily returns of the per share NAV to underperform the inverse of the daily returns of the Benchmark Futures Contract. USCF anticipates that interest rates may continue to increase over the near future from historical lows. However, it is anticipated that fees and expenses paid by DNO may continue to be higher than interest earned by DNO. As such, USCF anticipates that DNO will continue to underperform its benchmark until such a time when interest earned at least equals or exceeds the fees and expenses paid by DNO.\nThird, DNO may hold Other Crude Oil-Related Investments in its portfolio that may fail to closely track the inverse of the Benchmark Futures Contract's total return movements. In that case, the error in tracking the inverse of the Benchmark Futures Contract could result in daily changes in the per share NAV of DNO that are either too high, or too low, relative to the inverse of the daily changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract. During the year ended December 31, 2017, DNO did not hold any Other Crude Oil-Related Investments. If DNO increases in size, and due to its obligations to comply with regulatory limits, DNO may invest in Other Crude Oil-Related Investments which may have the effect of increasing transaction related expenses and may result in increased tracking error.\nTerm Structure of Crude Oil Futures Prices and the Impact on Total Returns. Several factors determine the total return from investing in futures contracts. One factor arises from rolling\u201d futures contracts that will expire at the end of the current month (the near\u201d or front\u201d month contract) forward each month prior to expiration. For a strategy that entails holding the near month contract, the price relationship between that futures contract and the next month futures contract will impact returns. For example, if the price of the near month futures contract is higher than the next futures month contract (a situation referred to as backwardation\u201d), then absent any other change, the price of a next month futures contract tends to rise in value as it becomes the near month futures contract and approaches expiration. Conversely, if the price of a near month futures contract is lower than the next month futures contract (a situation referred to as contango\u201d), then absent any other change, the price of a next month futures contract tends to decline in value as it becomes the near month futures contract and approaches expiration.\nAs an example, assume that the price of crude oil for immediate delivery, is $50 per barrel, and the value of a position in the near month futures contract is also $50. Over time, the price of crude oil will fluctuate based on a number of market factors, including demand for oil relative to supply. The value of the near month futures contract will likewise fluctuate in reaction to a number of market factors. If an investor seeks to maintain a position in a near month futures contract and not take delivery of physical barrels of crude oil, the investor must sell the current near month futures contract as it approaches expiration and invest in the next month futures contract. In order to continue holding a position in the current near month futures contract, this roll\u201d forward of the futures contract must be executed every month.\nContango and backwardation are natural market forces that have impacted the total return on an investment in DNO's shares during the past year relative to a hypothetical direct investment in crude oil. In the future, it is likely that the relationship between the market price of DNO's shares and changes in the spot prices of WTI light, sweet crude oil will continue to be impacted by contango and backwardation. It is important to note that this comparison ignores the potential costs associated with physically owning and storing crude oil, which could be substantial.\nIf the futures market is in backwardation, e.g., when the price of the near month futures contract is higher than the price of the next month futures contract, the investor would buy a next month futures contract for a lower price than the current near month futures contract. Assuming the price of the next month futures contract was $49 per barrel, or 2% cheaper than the $50 near month futures contract, then, hypothetically, and assuming no other changes (e.g., to either prevailing crude oil prices or the price relationship between the spot price, the near month contract and the next month contract, and, ignoring the impact of commission costs and the income earned on cash and/or cash equivalents), the value of the $49 next month futures contract would rise to $50 as it approaches expiration. In this example, the value of an investment in the next month futures contract would tend to outperform the spot price of crude oil. As a result, it would be possible for the new near month futures contract to rise 12% while the spot price of crude oil may have risen a lower amount, e.g., only 10%. Similarly, the spot price of crude oil could have fallen 10% while the value of an investment in the futures contract might have fallen another amount, e.g., only 8%. Over time, if backwardation remained constant, this difference between the spot price and the futures contract price would continue to increase.\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>47 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIf the futures market is in contango, an investor would be buying a next month futures contract for a higher price than the current near month futures contract. Again, assuming the near month futures contract is $50 per barrel, the price of the next month futures contract might be $51 per barrel, or 2% more expensive than the front month futures contract. Hypothetically, and assuming no other changes, the value of the $51 next month futures contract would fall to $50 as it approaches expiration. In this example, the value of an investment in the second month would tend to underperform the spot price of crude oil. As a result, it would be possible for the new near month futures contract to rise only 10% while the spot price of crude oil may have risen a higher amount, e.g., 12%. Similarly, the spot price of crude oil could have fallen 10% while the value of an investment in the second month futures contract might have fallen another amount, e.g., 12%. Over time, if contango remained constant, this difference between the spot price and the futures contract price would continue to increase.\nThe chart below compares the daily price of the near month crude oil futures contract to the price of 13th month crude oil futures contract (i.e., a contract one year forward) over the last 10 years. When the price of the near month futures contract is higher than the price of the 13th month futures contract, the market would be described as being in backwardation. When the price of the near month futures contract is lower than the 13th month futures contract, the market would be described as being in contango. Although the price of the near month futures contract and the price of the 13th month futures contract tend to move together, it can be seen that at times the near month futures contract prices are higher than the 13th month futures contract prices (backwardation) and, at other times, the near month futures contract prices are lower than the 13th month futures contract prices (contango).\n*PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>48 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAn alternative way to view the same data is to subtract the dollar price of the 13th month crude oil futures contract from the dollar price of the near month crude oil futures contract, as shown in the chart below. When the difference is positive, the market is in backwardation. When the difference is negative, the market is in contango. The crude oil market spent time in both backwardation and contango during the last ten years.\n*PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS\nAn investment in a portfolio that owned only the near month crude oil futures contract would likely produce a different result than an investment in a portfolio that owned an equal number of each of the near 12 months' of crude oil futures contracts. Generally speaking, when the crude oil futures market is in backwardation, a portfolio of only the near month crude oil futures contract may tend to have a higher total return than a portfolio of 12 months' of the crude oil futures contract. Conversely, if the crude oil futures market was in contango, the portfolio containing only 12 months' of crude oil futures contracts may tend to outperform the portfolio holding only the near month crude oil futures contract.\nHistorically, the crude oil futures markets have experienced periods of contango and backwardation, with backwardation being in place roughly as often as contango since oil futures trading started in 1982. Following the global financial crisis in the fourth quarter of 2008, the crude oil market moved into contango and remained in contango for a period of several years. During parts of 2009, the level of contango was unusually steep as a combination of slack U.S. and global demand for crude oil and issues involving the physical transportation and storage of crude oil at Cushing, Oklahoma, the primary pricing point for oil traded in the U.S., led to unusually high inventories of crude oil. A combination of improved transportation and storage capacity, along with growing demand for crude oil globally, moderated the inventory build-up and led to reduced levels of contango by 2011. However, at the end of November, 2014, global crude oil inventories grew rapidly after OPEC decided to defend its market share against U.S. shale-oil producers, resulting in another period during which the crude oil market remained primarily in contango, sometimes steep contango. This period of contango continued through December 31, 2016. In addition, the crude oil markets are expected to remain in contango until U.S. and global oil inventories decline significantly. If OPEC's recent cuts in oil production have their intended effect on the crude oil market then such a decline may occur in 2017.\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>49 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPeriods of contango or backwardation do not materially impact DNO's investment objective of having the daily percentage changes in its per share NAV track the daily percentage changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract since the impact of backwardation and contango tend to equally impact the daily percentage changes in price of both DNO's shares and the Benchmark Futures Contract. It is impossible to predict with any degree of certainty whether backwardation or contango will occur in the future. It is likely that both conditions will occur during different periods.\nCrude Oil Market. During the year ended December 31, 2017, crude oil prices have traded in a range between $42 to $60 as U.S. production growth threatened to overwhelm the impact of OPEC supply cuts. Prices rose during the third quarter as U.S. and global inventories declined. U.S. storage fell faster than the normal seasonal pace and dropped below prior-year inventory levels for the first time since 2014. U.S. production ramped up steadily throughout the year, returning to record levels last seen during summer 2015. However, production and rig count growth both appeared to level off towards the end of the quarter and may represent caution on the part of producers. Temporary disruptions also occurred as a result of hurricane Harvey. Looking ahead, expected demand growth appears strong while OPEC has stated it is prepared to take any action necessary to perpetuate the current trend towards a balanced market. Should global demand growth forecasts fail to be realized, or if OPEC is unable to counter growing U.S. production, there is a meaningful possibility that crude prices could fall again. On the other hand, increasing global tensions and the possibility of any number of conflicts escalating could lead to price shocks to the upside.\nCrude Oil Price Movements in Comparison to Other Energy Commodities and Investment Categories. USCF believes that investors frequently measure the degree to which prices or total returns of one investment or asset class move up or down in value in concert with another investment or asset class. Statistically, such a measure is usually done by measuring the correlation of the price movements of the two different investments or asset classes over some period of time. The correlation is scaled between 1 and -1, where 1 indicates that the two investment options move up or down in price or value together, known as positive correlation,\u201d and -1 indicates that they move in completely opposite directions, known as negative correlation.\u201d A correlation of 0 would mean that the movements of the two are neither positively nor negatively correlated, known as non-correlation.\u201d That is, the investment options sometimes move up and down together and other times move in opposite directions\nFor the ten-year time period between December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2017, the table below compares the monthly movements of crude oil prices versus the monthly movements of the prices of several other energy commodities, such as natural gas, diesel-heating oil, and unleaded gasoline, as well as several major non-commodity investment asset classes, such as large cap U.S. equities, U.S. government bonds and global equities. It can be seen that over this particular time period, the movement of crude oil on a monthly basis exhibited strong correlation with unleaded gasoline and diesel-heating oil, moderate correlation with the movements of large cap U.S. equities and global equities, limited correlation with natural gas, and moderate negative correlation with U.S. government bonds.\nTable 91: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>U.S. </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Gov't. </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Bonds </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Large </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(EFFAS </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Global </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Cap U.S. </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>U.S. </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Equities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Equities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Gov't. </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(FTSE </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Diesel- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Correlation Matrix </td> <td> </td> <td>(S&P </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Bond </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>World </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Unleaded </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Heating </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Natural </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Crude </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>December 31, 2007 - December 31, 2017* </td> <td> </td> <td>500) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Index) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Index) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Gasoline </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Oil </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Gas </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Oil </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Large Cap U.S. Equities (S&P 500) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.277 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.965 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.448 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.442 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.076 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.467 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>U.S. Gov't.

The results pictured above would have been different if a different range of dates had been selected. USCF believes that crude oil has historically not demonstrated a strong correlation with equities or bonds over long periods of time. However, USCF also believes that in the future it is possible that crude oil could have long term correlation results that indicate prices of crude oil more closely track the movements of equities or bonds. In addition, USCF believes that, when measured over time periods shorter than ten years, there will always be some periods where the correlation of crude oil to equities and bonds will be either more strongly positively correlated or more strongly negatively correlated than the long term historical results suggest.\nThe correlations between crude oil, natural gas, diesel-heating oil and gasoline are relevant because USCF endeavors to invest DNO's assets in Futures Contracts and Other Crude Oil-Related Investments so that daily changes in percentage terms in DNO's per share NAV correlate as closely as possible with the inverse of the daily changes in percentage terms in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract. If certain other fuel-based commodity futures contracts do not closely correlate with the Benchmark Futures Contract, then their use could lead to greater tracking error. As noted above, USCF also believes that the changes in percentage terms in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract will closely correlate with changes in percentage terms in the inverse of spot price of WTI light, sweet crude oil.\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>51 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies\nPreparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the application of appropriate accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. DNO's application of these policies involves judgments and actual results may differ from the estimates used.\nUSCF has evaluated the nature and types of estimates that it makes in preparing DNO's financial statements and related disclosures and has determined that the valuation of its investments, which are not traded on a United States or internationally recognized futures exchange (such as forward contracts and OTC swaps) involves a critical accounting policy. The values which are used by DNO for its Futures Contracts are provided by its commodity broker who uses market prices when available, while OTC swaps are valued based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that would be received from or paid to a third party in settlement of these derivative contracts prior to their delivery date and valued on a daily basis. In addition, DNO estimates interest and dividend income on a daily basis using prevailing rates earned on its cash and cash equivalents. These estimates are adjusted to the actual amount received on a monthly basis and the difference, if any, is not considered material.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nDNO has not made, and does not anticipate making, use of borrowings or other lines of credit to meet its obligations. DNO has met, and it is anticipated that DNO will continue to meet, its liquidity needs in the normal course of business from the proceeds of the sale of its investments, or from the Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents that it intends to hold at all times. DNO's liquidity needs include: redeeming shares, providing margin deposits for its existing Futures Contracts or the purchase of additional Futures Contracts and posting collateral for its OTC swaps, if applicable, and, except as noted below, payment of its expenses, summarized below under Contractual Obligations.\u201d\nDNO currently generates cash primarily from: (i) the sale of baskets consisting of 50,000 shares ( Creation Baskets\u201d) and (ii) income earned on Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents. DNO has allocated substantially all of its net assets to trading in Crude Oil Interests. DNO invests in Crude Oil Interests to the fullest extent possible without being leveraged or unable to satisfy its current or potential margin or collateral obligations with respect to its investments in Futures Contracts and Other Crude Oil-Related Investments. A significant portion of DNO's NAV is held in Treasuries, cash and cash equivalents that are used as margin and as collateral for its trading in Crude Oil Interests. The balance of the assets is held in DNO's account at its custodian bank and in Treasuries at the FCM. Income received from DNO's investments in money market funds and Treasuries is paid to DNO. During the year ended December 31, 2017, DNO's expenses exceeded the income DNO earned and the cash earned from the sale of Creation Baskets and the redemption of Redemption Baskets. During the year ended December 31, 2016, DNO's expenses exceeded the income DNO earned and the cash earned from the sale of Creation Baskets and the redemption of Redemption Baskets. To the extent expenses exceed income, DNO's NAV will be negatively impacted.\nDNO's investments in Crude Oil Interests may be subject to periods of illiquidity because of market conditions, regulatory considerations and other reasons. For example, most commodity exchanges limit the fluctuations in futures contracts prices during a single day by regulations referred to as daily limits.\u201d During a single day, no trades may be executed at prices beyond the daily limit. Once the price of a futures contract has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit, positions in the contracts can neither be taken nor liquidated unless the traders are willing to effect trades at or within the specified daily limit. Such market conditions could prevent DNO from promptly liquidating its positions in Futures Contracts. During the year ended December 31, 2017, DNO did not purchase or liquidate any of its positions while daily limits were in effect; however, DNO cannot predict whether such an event may occur in the future.\nSince the initial offering of shares, DNO has been responsible for expenses relating to: (i) management fees, (ii) brokerage fees and commissions, (iii) licensing fees for the use of intellectual property, (iv) ongoing registration expenses in connection with offers and sales of its shares subsequent to the initial offering, (v) other expenses, including tax reporting costs, (vi) fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF and (vii) other extraordinary expenses not in the ordinary course of business, while USCF has been responsible for expenses relating to the fees of DNO's Marketing Agent, Administrator and Custodian and registration expenses relating to the initial offering of shares. If USCF and DNO are unsuccessful in raising sufficient funds to cover these respective expenses or in locating any other source of funding, DNO will terminate and investors may lose all or part of their investment.\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>52 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nMarket Risk\nTrading in Futures Contracts and Other Crude Oil-Related Investments, such as forwards, involves DNO entering into contractual commitments to purchase or sell crude oil at a specified date in the future. The aggregate market value of the contracts will significantly exceed DNO's future cash requirements since DNO intends to close out its open positions prior to settlement. As a result, DNO is generally only subject to the risk of loss arising from the change in value of the contracts. DNO considers the fair value\u201d of its derivative instruments to be the unrealized gain or loss on the contracts. The market risk associated with DNO's commitments to purchase crude oil is limited to the aggregate market value of the contracts held. However, should DNO enter into a contractual commitment to sell crude oil, it would be required to make delivery of the crude oil at the contract price, repurchase the contract at prevailing prices or settle in cash. Since there are no limits on the future price of crude oil, the market risk to DNO could be unlimited.\nDNO's exposure to market risk depends on a number of factors, including the markets for crude oil, the volatility of interest rates and foreign exchange rates, the liquidity of the Futures Contracts and Other Crude Oil-Related Investments markets and the relationships among the contracts held by DNO. Drastic market occurrences could ultimately lead to the loss of all or substantially all of an investor's capital.\nCredit Risk\nWhen DNO enters into Futures Contracts and Other Crude Oil-Related Investments, it is exposed to the credit risk that the counterparty will not be able to meet its obligations. The counterparty for the Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX and on most other futures exchanges is the clearinghouse associated with the particular exchange. In general, in addition to margin required to be posted by the clearinghouse in connection with cleared trades, clearinghouses are backed by their members who may be required to share in the financial burden resulting from the nonperformance of one of their members and, therefore, this additional member support should significantly reduce credit risk. DNO is not currently a member of any clearinghouse. Some foreign exchanges are not backed by their clearinghouse members but may be backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions. There can be no assurance that any counterparty, clearinghouse, or their members or their financial backers will satisfy their obligations to DNO in such circumstances.\nUSCF attempts to manage the credit risk of DNO by following various trading limitations and policies. In particular, DNO generally posts margin and/or holds liquid assets that are approximately equal to the market value of its obligations to counterparties under the Futures Contracts and Other Crude Oil-Related Investments it holds. USCF has implemented procedures that include, but are not limited to, executing and clearing trades only with creditworthy parties and/or requiring the posting of collateral or margin by such parties for the benefit of DNO to limit its credit exposure. An FCM, when acting on behalf of DNO in accepting orders to purchase or sell Futures Contracts on United States exchanges, is required by CFTC regulations to separately account for and segregate as belonging to DNO, all assets of DNO relating to domestic Futures Contracts trading. FCMs are not allowed to commingle DNO's assets with their other assets. In addition, the CFTC requires commodity brokers to hold in a secure account DNO's assets related to foreign Futures Contracts trading.\nIn the future, DNO may purchase OTC swaps, see", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto of DNO included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nForward-Looking Information\nThis annual report on Form 10-K, including this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d contains forward-looking statements regarding the plans and objectives of management for future operations. This information may involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause DNO's actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements, which involve assumptions and describe DNO's future plans, strategies and expectations, are generally identifiable by use of the words may,\u201d will,\u201d should,\u201d expect,\u201d anticipate,\u201d estimate,\u201d believe,\u201d intend\u201d or project,\u201d the negative of these words, other variations on these words or comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that may be incorrect, and DNO cannot assure investors that the projections included in these forward-looking statements will come to pass. DNO's actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors.\nDNO has based the forward-looking statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K on information available to it on the date of this annual report on Form 10-K, and DNO assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Although DNO undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, investors are advised to consult any additional disclosures that DNO may make directly to them or through reports that DNO in the future files with the SEC, including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.\nIntroduction\nDNO, a Delaware limited partnership, is a commodity pool that issues shares that may be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca. The investment objective of DNO is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares' per share NAV to inversely reflect the daily changes, in percentage terms, of the spot price of WTI light, sweet crude oil delivered to Cushing, Oklahoma, as measured by the daily changes in the price of the futures contract for WTI light, sweet crude oil traded on the NYMEX that is the near month contract to expire, except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, in which case it will be measured by the futures contract that is the next month contract to expire (the Benchmark Futures Contract\u201d), less DNO's expenses. Near month contract\u201d means the next contract traded on the NYMEX due to expire. Next month contract\u201d means the first contract traded on the NYMEX due to expire after the near month contract.\nDNO's investment objective is not for its NAV or market price of shares to equal, in dollar terms, the inverse of the spot price of WTI light, sweet crude oil or any particular futures contract based on WTI light, sweet crude oil, nor is DNO's investment objective for the percentage change in its NAV to reflect the inverse of the percentage change of the price of any particular futures contract as measured over a time period greater than one day. USCF believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in Futures Contracts and Other Crude Oil-Related Investments.\nDNO seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing so that the average daily percentage change in DNO's NAV for any period of 30 successive valuation days will be within plus/minus ten percent (10%) of the inverse of the average daily percentage change in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract over the same period.\nThe regulation of commodity interest trading in the United States and other countries is an evolving area of the law. The various statements made in this summary are subject to modification by legislative action and changes in the rules and regulations of the SEC, FINRA, CFTC, the NFA, the futures exchanges, clearing organizations and other regulatory bodies. Pending final resolution of all applicable regulatory requirements, some examples of how new rules and regulations could impact DNO are discussed in Item 1. Business\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d in this annual report on Form 10-K.\n 41 \nPrice Movements\nCrude oil futures prices were volatile during the year ended December 31, 2017 and exhibited moderate daily swings along with an uneven upward trend during the year. The price of the Benchmark Futures Contract started the year at $53.720 per barrel. The high of the year was on December 29, 2017 when the price reached $60.420 per barrel. The low of the year was on June 21, 2017 when the price dropped to $42.530 per barrel. The year ended with the Benchmark Futures Contract at $60.420 per barrel, an increase of approximately 12.47% over the year. DNO's per share NAV began the year at $61.96 and ended the year at $56.56 on December 31, 2017, a decrease of approximately (8.72)% over the year. DNO's per share NAV reached its high for the year on June 21, 2017 at $80.19 and reached its low for the year on December 29, 2017 at $56.56. Since DNO's investment objective is to track the inverse of the daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract, the decrease in DNO's per share NAV reflects the inverse of the increase in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract. The Benchmark Futures Contract prices listed above began with the February 2017 contracts and ended with the February 2018 contracts. The increase of approximately 12.47% on the Benchmark Futures Contract listed above is a hypothetical return only and could not actually be achieved by an investor holding Futures Contracts. An investment in Futures Contracts would need to be rolled forward during the time period described in order to simulate such a result. Furthermore, the change in the nominal price of these differing Futures Contracts, measured from the start of the year to the end of the year, does not represent the actual benchmark results that DNO seeks to track, which are more fully described below in the section titled Tracking DNO's Benchmark.\u201d\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the crude oil futures market was in a state of contango, meaning that the price of the near month crude Oil Futures Contract was lower than the price of the next month crude Oil Futures Contract, or contracts further away from expiration. On days when the market is in backwardation, the price of the near month crude Oil Futures Contract is typically higher than the price of the next month crude Oil Futures Contract or contracts further away from expiration. For a discussion of the impact of backwardation and contango on total returns, see Term Structure of Crude Oil Prices and the Impact on Total Returns\u201d below.\nValuation of Futures Contracts and the Computation of the Per Share NAV\nThe per share NAV of DNO's shares is calculated once each NYSE Arca trading day. The per share NAV for a particular trading day is released after 4:00 p.m. New York time. Trading during the core trading session on the NYSE Arca typically closes at 4:00 p.m. New York time. The Administrator uses the NYMEX closing price (determined at the earlier of the close of the NYMEX or 2:30 p.m. New York time) for the contracts held on the NYMEX, but calculates or determines the value of all other DNO investments, including ICE Futures contracts or other futures contracts, as of the earlier of the close of the NYSE Arca or 4:00 p.m. New York time.\nResults of Operations and the Crude Oil Market\nResults of Operations. On September 24, 2009, DNO listed its shares on the NYSE Arca under the ticker symbol DNO.\u201d On that day, DNO established its initial offering price at $50.00 per share and issued 200,000 shares to the initial Authorized Participant, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., in exchange for $10,000,000 in cash.\nSince its initial offering of 25,000,000 shares, DNO has not registered any subsequent offerings of its shares. As of December 31, 2017, DNO had issued 4,200,000 shares, 200,000 of which were outstanding. As of December 31, 2017, there were 20,800,000 shares registered but not yet issued.\nMore shares may have been issued by DNO than are outstanding due to the redemption of shares. Unlike funds that are registered under the 1940 Act, shares that have been redeemed by DNO cannot be resold by DNO. As a result, DNO contemplates that additional offerings of its shares will be registered with the SEC in the future in anticipation of additional issuances and redemptions.\nAs of December 31, 2017, DNO had the following Authorized Participants: BNP Paribas Prime Brokerage, Inc., BNP Paribas Securities Corp., Citadel Securities LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Credit Suisse Securities USA LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Goldman Sachs & Company, JP Morgan Securities Inc., Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corporation, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Nomura Securities International Inc., RBC Capital Markets LLC, SG Americas Securities LLC, UBS Securities LLC and Virtu Financial BD LLC.\n 42 \nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016; and for the Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to the Year Ended December 31,\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Per share net asset value, end of period </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>56.56 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>61.96 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>81.25 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Average daily total net assets </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,484,809 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,980,695 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,702,689 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Dividend and interest income earned on Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>81,805 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50,150 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,690 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Annualized yield based on average daily total net assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.78 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.30 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.05 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Management fee </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>62,909 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>101,884 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>124,216 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total fees and other expenses excluding management fees </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>100,491 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>154,552 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>140,970 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total amount of the expense waiver </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>84,752 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>129,082 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>109,915 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Expenses before allowance for the expense waiver </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>163,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>256,436 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>265,186 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Expenses after allowance for the expense waiver </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>78,648 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>127,354 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>155,271 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total commissions accrued to brokers </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,960 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50,645 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>51,218 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total commissions as annualized percentage of average total net assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.20 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.30 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.25 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commissions accrued as a result of rebalancing </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,774 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,839 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>48,836 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Percentage of commissions accrued as a result of rebalancing </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>94.34 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>98.41 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>95.35 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commissions accrued as a result of creation and redemption activity </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,186 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>806 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,382 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Percentage of commissions accrued as a result of creation and redemption activity </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.66 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.59 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.65 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPortfolio Expenses.

The fee is accrued daily and paid monthly.\nThe decrease in the per share NAV for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, was due primarily to higher prices for crude oil and the related decrease in the value of the crude oil futures contracts in which DNO held and traded; and the decrease in the per share NAV for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, was due primarily to higher prices for crude oil and the related decrease in the value of the crude oil futures contracts in which DNO held and traded.\nAverage interest rates earned on short-term investments held by DNO, including cash, cash equivalents and Treasuries, were higher during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016; and were higher during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. As a result, the amount of income earned by DNO as a percentage of average daily total net assets was higher during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016; and was higher during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. To the degree that the aggregate yield is higher, the net expense ratio, inclusive of income, will be lower.\nThe decrease in total fees and other expenses excluding management fees for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 was due primarily to DNO's smaller size as measured by total net assets and lower professional fees; and the increase in total fees and other expenses excluding management fees for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, was due primarily to higher professional fees.\nThe decrease in total commissions accrued to brokers for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, was due primarily to a lower number of futures contracts being held and traded; and the decrease in total commissions accrued to brokers for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, was due primarily to lower number of futures contracts being held and traded.\n 43 \nFor the Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Three Months Ended December 31, 2016;

and the decrease in the per share NAV for the three months ended December 31, 2016, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2015, was due primarily to higher prices for crude oil and the related decrease in the value of the crude oil futures contracts in which DNO held and traded.\nAverage interest rates earned on short-term investments held by DNO, including cash, cash equivalents and Treasuries, were higher during the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016; and were higher during the three months ended December 31, 2016, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2015. As a result, the amount of income earned by DNO as a percentage of average daily total net assets was higher during the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016; and was higher during the three months ended December 31, 2016 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2015. To the degree that the aggregate yield is higher, the net expense ratio, inclusive of income, will be lower.\nThe decrease in total fees and other expenses excluding management fees for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016 was due to lower reporting and professional fees; and the decrease in total fees and other expenses excluding management fees for the three months ended December 31, 2016, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2015, was due primarily to DNO's smaller size as measured by total net assets.\nThe decrease in total commissions accrued to brokers for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016, was due primarily to a lower number of futures contracts being held and traded; and the decrease in total commissions accrued to brokers for the three months ended December 31, 2016, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2015, was due primarily to lower number of futures contracts being held and traded.\n 44 \nTracking DNO's Benchmark\nUSCF seeks to manage DNO's portfolio such that changes in its average daily per share NAV, on a percentage basis, closely inversely track the daily changes in the average price of the Benchmark Futures Contract, also on a percentage basis. Specifically, USCF seeks to manage the portfolio such that over any rolling period of 30-valuation days, the average daily change in DNO's per share NAV is within a range of (90)% to (110)% ((0.9) to (1.1)) of the average daily change in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract. As an example, if the average daily movement of the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract for a particular 30-valuation day time period was 0.50% per day, USCF would attempt to manage the portfolio such that the average daily movement of the per share NAV during that same time period fell between (0.45)% and (0.55)% (i.e., between (0.9) and (1.1) of the benchmark's results). DNO's portfolio management goals do not include trying to make the nominal price of DNO's per share NAV equal to the inverse of the nominal price of the current Benchmark Futures Contract or the inverse of the spot price for WTI light, sweet crude oil. USCF believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in short positions in Futures Contracts and Other Crude Oil-Related Investments.\nFor the 30-valuation days ended December 31, 2017, the inverse of the simple average daily change in the Benchmark Futures Contract was (0.286)%, while the simple average daily change in the per share NAV of DNO over the same time period was (0.285)%. The average daily difference was 0.001% (or 0.1 basis points, where 1 basis point equals 1/100 of 1%). As a percentage of the inverse of the daily movement of the Benchmark Futures Contract, the average error in daily tracking by the per share NAV was 0.408%, meaning that over this time period DNO's tracking error was within the plus or minus 10% range established as its benchmark tracking goal. The first chart below shows the daily movement of DNO's per share NAV versus the daily movement of the Benchmark Futures Contract for the 30-valuation day period ended December 31, 2017, the last trading day in December. The second chart below shows the monthly total returns of DNO as compared to the monthly value of the Benchmark Futures Contract for the five years ended December 31, 2017.\nSince the commencement of the offering of DNO's shares to the public on September 24, 2009 to December 31, 2017, the inverse of the simple average daily change in the Benchmark Futures Contract was 0.029%, while the simple average daily change in the per share NAV of DNO over the same time period was 0.026%. The average daily difference was (0.003)% (or (0.3) basis points, where 1 basis point equals 1/100 of 1%). As a percentage of the inverse of the daily movement of the Benchmark Futures Contract, the average error in daily tracking by the per share NAV was (0.844)%, meaning that over this time period DNO's tracking error was within the plus or minus 10% range established as its benchmark tracking goal.\n*PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS\n*PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS\n 45 \nAn alternative tracking measurement of the return performance of DNO versus the inverse of the return of its Benchmark Futures Contract can be calculated by comparing the actual return of DNO, measured by changes in its per share NAV, versus the expected changes in its per share NAV under the assumption that DNO's returns had been exactly the same as inverse to the daily changes in its Benchmark Futures Contract.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the actual total return of DNO as measured by changes in its per share NAV was (8.72)%. This is based on an initial per share NAV of $61.96 as of December 31, 2016 and an ending per share NAV as of December 31, 2017 of $56.56. During this time period, DNO made no distributions to its shareholders. However, if DNO's daily changes in its per share NAV had instead exactly inversely tracked the changes in the daily total return of the Benchmark Futures Contract, DNO would have had an estimated per share NAV of $56.54 as of December 31, 2017, for a total return over the relevant time period of (8.75)%. The difference between the actual per share NAV total return of DNO of (8.72)% and the expected total return based on the inverse of changes in the daily return of the Benchmark Futures Contract of (8.75)% was an error over the time period of 0.03%, which is to say that DNO's actual total return outperformed the inverse of the benchmark result by that percentage. DNO incurs expenses primarily composed of the management fee, brokerage commissions for the buying and selling of futures contracts, and other expenses. The impact of these expenses, offset by interest and dividend income, and net of positive or negative execution, tends to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of DNO to track slightly lower than the inverse of the daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.\nBy comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2016, the actual total return of DNO as measured by changes in its per share NAV was (23.74)%. This was based on an initial per share NAV of $81.25 as of December 31, 2015 and an ending per share NAV as of December 31, 2016 of $61.96. During this time period, DNO made no distributions to its shareholders. However, if DNO's daily changes in its per share NAV had instead exactly inversely tracked the changes in the daily total return of the Benchmark Futures Contract, DNO would have had an estimated per share NAV of $62.16 as of December 31, 2016, for a total return over the relevant time period of (23.50)%. The difference between the actual per share NAV total return of DNO of (23.74)% and the expected total return based on the inverse of changes in the daily return of the Benchmark Futures Contract of (23.50)% was an error over the time period of (0.24)%, which is to say that DNO's actual total return underperformed the inverse of the benchmark result by that percentage. DNO incurs expenses primarily composed of the management fee, brokerage commissions for the buying and selling of futures contracts, and other expenses. The impact of these expenses, offset by interest and dividend income, and net of positive or negative execution, tended to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of DNO to track slightly lower than the inverse of the daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.\nBy comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2015, the actual total return of DNO as measured by changes in its per share NAV was 45.92%. This was based on an initial per share NAV of $55.68 on December 31, 2014 and an ending per share NAV as of December 31, 2015 of $81.25. During this time period, DNO made no distributions to its shareholders. However, if DNO's daily changes in its per share NAV had instead exactly inversely tracked the changes in the daily total return of the Benchmark Futures Contract, DNO would have had an estimated per share NAV of $81.68 as of December 31, 2015, for a total return over the relevant time period of 46.70%. The difference between the actual per share NAV total return of DNO of 45.92% and the expected total return based on the inverse of changes in the daily return of the Benchmark Futures Contract of 46.70% was an error over the time period of (0.78)%, which is to say that DNO's actual total return underperformed the inverse of the benchmark result by that percentage. DNO incurs expenses primarily composed of the management fee, brokerage commissions for the buying and selling of futures contracts, and other expenses. The impact of these expenses, offset by interest and dividend income, and net of positive or negative execution, tended to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of DNO to track slightly lower than the inverse of the daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.\nThere are currently three factors that have impacted or are most likely to impact DNO's ability to accurately inversely track its Benchmark Futures Contract.\nFirst, DNO may buy or sell its holdings in the then current Benchmark Futures Contract at a price other than the closing settlement price of that contract on the day during which DNO executes the trade. In that case, DNO may pay a price that is higher, or lower, than that of the Benchmark Futures Contract, which could cause the changes in the daily per share NAV of DNO to either be too high or too low relative to the inverse of the daily changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract. During the year ended December 31, 2017, USCF attempted to minimize the effect of these transactions by seeking to execute its purchase or sale of the Benchmark Futures Contract at, or as close as possible to, the end of the day settlement price. However, it may not always be possible for DNO to obtain the closing settlement price and there is no assurance that failure to obtain the closing settlement price in the future will not adversely impact DNO's attempt to inversely track the Benchmark Futures Contract over time.\n 46 \nSecond, DNO incurs expenses primarily composed of the management fee, brokerage commissions for the buying and selling of futures contracts, and other expenses. The impact of these expenses tends to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of DNO to track slightly lower than the inverse of daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract. At the same time, DNO earns dividend and interest income on its cash, cash equivalents and Treasuries. DNO is not required to distribute any portion of its income to its shareholders and did not make any distributions to shareholders during the year ended December 31, 2017. Interest payments, and any other income, were retained within the portfolio and added to DNO's NAV. When this income exceeds the level of DNO's expenses for its management fee, brokerage commissions and other expenses (including ongoing registration fees, licensing fees and the fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF), DNO will realize a net yield that will tend to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of DNO to track slightly higher than the inverse of daily changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract. If short-term interest rates rise above the current levels, the level of deviation created by the yield would decrease. Conversely, if short-term interest rates were to decline, the amount of error created by the yield would increase. When short-term yields drop to a level lower than the combined expenses of the management fee and the brokerage commissions, then the tracking error becomes a negative number and would tend to cause the daily returns of the per share NAV to underperform the inverse of the daily returns of the Benchmark Futures Contract. USCF anticipates that interest rates may continue to increase over the near future from historical lows. However, it is anticipated that fees and expenses paid by DNO may continue to be higher than interest earned by DNO. As such, USCF anticipates that DNO will continue to underperform its benchmark until such a time when interest earned at least equals or exceeds the fees and expenses paid by DNO.\nThird, DNO may hold Other Crude Oil-Related Investments in its portfolio that may fail to closely track the inverse of the Benchmark Futures Contract's total return movements. In that case, the error in tracking the inverse of the Benchmark Futures Contract could result in daily changes in the per share NAV of DNO that are either too high, or too low, relative to the inverse of the daily changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract. During the year ended December 31, 2017, DNO did not hold any Other Crude Oil-Related Investments. If DNO increases in size, and due to its obligations to comply with regulatory limits, DNO may invest in Other Crude Oil-Related Investments which may have the effect of increasing transaction related expenses and may result in increased tracking error.\nTerm Structure of Crude Oil Futures Prices and the Impact on Total Returns. Several factors determine the total return from investing in futures contracts. One factor arises from rolling\u201d futures contracts that will expire at the end of the current month (the near\u201d or front\u201d month contract) forward each month prior to expiration. For a strategy that entails holding the near month contract, the price relationship between that futures contract and the next month futures contract will impact returns. For example, if the price of the near month futures contract is higher than the next futures month contract (a situation referred to as backwardation\u201d), then absent any other change, the price of a next month futures contract tends to rise in value as it becomes the near month futures contract and approaches expiration. Conversely, if the price of a near month futures contract is lower than the next month futures contract (a situation referred to as contango\u201d), then absent any other change, the price of a next month futures contract tends to decline in value as it becomes the near month futures contract and approaches expiration.\nAs an example, assume that the price of crude oil for immediate delivery, is $50 per barrel, and the value of a position in the near month futures contract is also $50. Over time, the price of crude oil will fluctuate based on a number of market factors, including demand for oil relative to supply. The value of the near month futures contract will likewise fluctuate in reaction to a number of market factors. If an investor seeks to maintain a position in a near month futures contract and not take delivery of physical barrels of crude oil, the investor must sell the current near month futures contract as it approaches expiration and invest in the next month futures contract. In order to continue holding a position in the current near month futures contract, this roll\u201d forward of the futures contract must be executed every month.\nContango and backwardation are natural market forces that have impacted the total return on an investment in DNO's shares during the past year relative to a hypothetical direct investment in crude oil. In the future, it is likely that the relationship between the market price of DNO's shares and changes in the spot prices of WTI light, sweet crude oil will continue to be impacted by contango and backwardation. It is important to note that this comparison ignores the potential costs associated with physically owning and storing crude oil, which could be substantial.\nIf the futures market is in backwardation, e.g., when the price of the near month futures contract is higher than the price of the next month futures contract, the investor would buy a next month futures contract for a lower price than the current near month futures contract. Assuming the price of the next month futures contract was $49 per barrel, or 2% cheaper than the $50 near month futures contract, then, hypothetically, and assuming no other changes (e.g., to either prevailing crude oil prices or the price relationship between the spot price, the near month contract and the next month contract, and, ignoring the impact of commission costs and the income earned on cash and/or cash equivalents), the value of the $49 next month futures contract would rise to $50 as it approaches expiration. In this example, the value of an investment in the next month futures contract would tend to outperform the spot price of crude oil. As a result, it would be possible for the new near month futures contract to rise 12% while the spot price of crude oil may have risen a lower amount, e.g., only 10%. Similarly, the spot price of crude oil could have fallen 10% while the value of an investment in the futures contract might have fallen another amount, e.g., only 8%. Over time, if backwardation remained constant, this difference between the spot price and the futures contract price would continue to increase.\n 47 \nIf the futures market is in contango, an investor would be buying a next month futures contract for a higher price than the current near month futures contract. Again, assuming the near month futures contract is $50 per barrel, the price of the next month futures contract might be $51 per barrel, or 2% more expensive than the front month futures contract. Hypothetically, and assuming no other changes, the value of the $51 next month futures contract would fall to $50 as it approaches expiration. In this example, the value of an investment in the second month would tend to underperform the spot price of crude oil. As a result, it would be possible for the new near month futures contract to rise only 10% while the spot price of crude oil may have risen a higher amount, e.g., 12%. Similarly, the spot price of crude oil could have fallen 10% while the value of an investment in the second month futures contract might have fallen another amount, e.g., 12%. Over time, if contango remained constant, this difference between the spot price and the futures contract price would continue to increase.\nThe chart below compares the daily price of the near month crude oil futures contract to the price of 13th month crude oil futures contract (i.e., a contract one year forward) over the last 10 years. When the price of the near month futures contract is higher than the price of the 13th month futures contract, the market would be described as being in backwardation. When the price of the near month futures contract is lower than the 13th month futures contract, the market would be described as being in contango. Although the price of the near month futures contract and the price of the 13th month futures contract tend to move together, it can be seen that at times the near month futures contract prices are higher than the 13th month futures contract prices (backwardation) and, at other times, the near month futures contract prices are lower than the 13th month futures contract prices (contango).\n*PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS\n 48 \nAn alternative way to view the same data is to subtract the dollar price of the 13th month crude oil futures contract from the dollar price of the near month crude oil futures contract, as shown in the chart below. When the difference is positive, the market is in backwardation. When the difference is negative, the market is in contango. The crude oil market spent time in both backwardation and contango during the last ten years.\n*PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS\nAn investment in a portfolio that owned only the near month crude oil futures contract would likely produce a different result than an investment in a portfolio that owned an equal number of each of the near 12 months' of crude oil futures contracts. Generally speaking, when the crude oil futures market is in backwardation, a portfolio of only the near month crude oil futures contract may tend to have a higher total return than a portfolio of 12 months' of the crude oil futures contract. Conversely, if the crude oil futures market was in contango, the portfolio containing only 12 months' of crude oil futures contracts may tend to outperform the portfolio holding only the near month crude oil futures contract.\nHistorically, the crude oil futures markets have experienced periods of contango and backwardation, with backwardation being in place roughly as often as contango since oil futures trading started in 1982. Following the global financial crisis in the fourth quarter of 2008, the crude oil market moved into contango and remained in contango for a period of several years. During parts of 2009, the level of contango was unusually steep as a combination of slack U.S. and global demand for crude oil and issues involving the physical transportation and storage of crude oil at Cushing, Oklahoma, the primary pricing point for oil traded in the U.S., led to unusually high inventories of crude oil. A combination of improved transportation and storage capacity, along with growing demand for crude oil globally, moderated the inventory build-up and led to reduced levels of contango by 2011. However, at the end of November, 2014, global crude oil inventories grew rapidly after OPEC decided to defend its market share against U.S. shale-oil producers, resulting in another period during which the crude oil market remained primarily in contango, sometimes steep contango. This period of contango continued through December 31, 2016. In addition, the crude oil markets are expected to remain in contango until U.S. and global oil inventories decline significantly. If OPEC's recent cuts in oil production have their intended effect on the crude oil market then such a decline may occur in 2017.\n 49 \nPeriods of contango or backwardation do not materially impact DNO's investment objective of having the daily percentage changes in its per share NAV track the daily percentage changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract since the impact of backwardation and contango tend to equally impact the daily percentage changes in price of both DNO's shares and the Benchmark Futures Contract. It is impossible to predict with any degree of certainty whether backwardation or contango will occur in the future. It is likely that both conditions will occur during different periods.\nCrude Oil Market. During the year ended December 31, 2017, crude oil prices have traded in a range between $42 to $60 as U.S. production growth threatened to overwhelm the impact of OPEC supply cuts. Prices rose during the third quarter as U.S. and global inventories declined. U.S. storage fell faster than the normal seasonal pace and dropped below prior-year inventory levels for the first time since 2014. U.S. production ramped up steadily throughout the year, returning to record levels last seen during summer 2015. However, production and rig count growth both appeared to level off towards the end of the quarter and may represent caution on the part of producers. Temporary disruptions also occurred as a result of hurricane Harvey. Looking ahead, expected demand growth appears strong while OPEC has stated it is prepared to take any action necessary to perpetuate the current trend towards a balanced market. Should global demand growth forecasts fail to be realized, or if OPEC is unable to counter growing U.S. production, there is a meaningful possibility that crude prices could fall again. On the other hand, increasing global tensions and the possibility of any number of conflicts escalating could lead to price shocks to the upside.\nCrude Oil Price Movements in Comparison to Other Energy Commodities and Investment Categories. USCF believes that investors frequently measure the degree to which prices or total returns of one investment or asset class move up or down in value in concert with another investment or asset class. Statistically, such a measure is usually done by measuring the correlation of the price movements of the two different investments or asset classes over some period of time. The correlation is scaled between 1 and -1, where 1 indicates that the two investment options move up or down in price or value together, known as positive correlation,\u201d and -1 indicates that they move in completely opposite directions, known as negative correlation.\u201d A correlation of 0 would mean that the movements of the two are neither positively nor negatively correlated, known as non-correlation.\u201d That is, the investment options sometimes move up and down together and other times move in opposite directions\nFor the ten-year time period between December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2017, the table below compares the monthly movements of crude oil prices versus the monthly movements of the prices of several other energy commodities, such as natural gas, diesel-heating oil, and unleaded gasoline, as well as several major non-commodity investment asset classes, such as large cap U.S. equities, U.S. government bonds and global equities. It can be seen that over this particular time period, the movement of crude oil on a monthly basis exhibited strong correlation with unleaded gasoline and diesel-heating oil, moderate correlation with the movements of large cap U.S. equities and global equities, limited correlation with natural gas, and moderate negative correlation with U.S. government bonds.\nTable 91: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>U.S. </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Gov't. </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Bonds </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Large </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(EFFAS </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Global </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Cap U.S. </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>U.S. </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Equities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Equities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Gov't. </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(FTSE </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Diesel- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Correlation Matrix </td> <td> </td> <td>(S&P </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Bond </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>World </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Unleaded </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Heating </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Natural </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Crude </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>December 31, 2007 - December 31, 2017* </td> <td> </td> <td>500) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Index) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Index) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Gasoline </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Oil </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Gas </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Oil </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Large Cap U.S. Equities (S&P 500) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.277 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.965 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.448 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.442 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.076 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.467 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>U.S. Gov't.

The results pictured above would have been different if a different range of dates had been selected. USCF believes that crude oil has historically not demonstrated a strong correlation with equities or bonds over long periods of time. However, USCF also believes that in the future it is possible that crude oil could have long term correlation results that indicate prices of crude oil more closely track the movements of equities or bonds. In addition, USCF believes that, when measured over time periods shorter than ten years, there will always be some periods where the correlation of crude oil to equities and bonds will be either more strongly positively correlated or more strongly negatively correlated than the long term historical results suggest.\nThe correlations between crude oil, natural gas, diesel-heating oil and gasoline are relevant because USCF endeavors to invest DNO's assets in Futures Contracts and Other Crude Oil-Related Investments so that daily changes in percentage terms in DNO's per share NAV correlate as closely as possible with the inverse of the daily changes in percentage terms in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract. If certain other fuel-based commodity futures contracts do not closely correlate with the Benchmark Futures Contract, then their use could lead to greater tracking error. As noted above, USCF also believes that the changes in percentage terms in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract will closely correlate with changes in percentage terms in the inverse of spot price of WTI light, sweet crude oil.\n 51 \nCritical Accounting Policies\nPreparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the application of appropriate accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. DNO's application of these policies involves judgments and actual results may differ from the estimates used.\nUSCF has evaluated the nature and types of estimates that it makes in preparing DNO's financial statements and related disclosures and has determined that the valuation of its investments, which are not traded on a United States or internationally recognized futures exchange (such as forward contracts and OTC swaps) involves a critical accounting policy. The values which are used by DNO for its Futures Contracts are provided by its commodity broker who uses market prices when available, while OTC swaps are valued based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that would be received from or paid to a third party in settlement of these derivative contracts prior to their delivery date and valued on a daily basis. In addition, DNO estimates interest and dividend income on a daily basis using prevailing rates earned on its cash and cash equivalents. These estimates are adjusted to the actual amount received on a monthly basis and the difference, if any, is not considered material.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nDNO has not made, and does not anticipate making, use of borrowings or other lines of credit to meet its obligations. DNO has met, and it is anticipated that DNO will continue to meet, its liquidity needs in the normal course of business from the proceeds of the sale of its investments, or from the Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents that it intends to hold at all times. DNO's liquidity needs include: redeeming shares, providing margin deposits for its existing Futures Contracts or the purchase of additional Futures Contracts and posting collateral for its OTC swaps, if applicable, and, except as noted below, payment of its expenses, summarized below under Contractual Obligations.\u201d\nDNO currently generates cash primarily from: (i) the sale of baskets consisting of 50,000 shares ( Creation Baskets\u201d) and (ii) income earned on Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents. DNO has allocated substantially all of its net assets to trading in Crude Oil Interests. DNO invests in Crude Oil Interests to the fullest extent possible without being leveraged or unable to satisfy its current or potential margin or collateral obligations with respect to its investments in Futures Contracts and Other Crude Oil-Related Investments. A significant portion of DNO's NAV is held in Treasuries, cash and cash equivalents that are used as margin and as collateral for its trading in Crude Oil Interests. The balance of the assets is held in DNO's account at its custodian bank and in Treasuries at the FCM. Income received from DNO's investments in money market funds and Treasuries is paid to DNO. During the year ended December 31, 2017, DNO's expenses exceeded the income DNO earned and the cash earned from the sale of Creation Baskets and the redemption of Redemption Baskets. During the year ended December 31, 2016, DNO's expenses exceeded the income DNO earned and the cash earned from the sale of Creation Baskets and the redemption of Redemption Baskets. To the extent expenses exceed income, DNO's NAV will be negatively impacted.\nDNO's investments in Crude Oil Interests may be subject to periods of illiquidity because of market conditions, regulatory considerations and other reasons. For example, most commodity exchanges limit the fluctuations in futures contracts prices during a single day by regulations referred to as daily limits.\u201d During a single day, no trades may be executed at prices beyond the daily limit. Once the price of a futures contract has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit, positions in the contracts can neither be taken nor liquidated unless the traders are willing to effect trades at or within the specified daily limit. Such market conditions could prevent DNO from promptly liquidating its positions in Futures Contracts. During the year ended December 31, 2017, DNO did not purchase or liquidate any of its positions while daily limits were in effect; however, DNO cannot predict whether such an event may occur in the future.\nSince the initial offering of shares, DNO has been responsible for expenses relating to: (i) management fees, (ii) brokerage fees and commissions, (iii) licensing fees for the use of intellectual property, (iv) ongoing registration expenses in connection with offers and sales of its shares subsequent to the initial offering, (v) other expenses, including tax reporting costs, (vi) fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF and (vii) other extraordinary expenses not in the ordinary course of business, while USCF has been responsible for expenses relating to the fees of DNO's Marketing Agent, Administrator and Custodian and registration expenses relating to the initial offering of shares. If USCF and DNO are unsuccessful in raising sufficient funds to cover these respective expenses or in locating any other source of funding, DNO will terminate and investors may lose all or part of their investment.\n 52 \nMarket Risk\nTrading in Futures Contracts and Other Crude Oil-Related Investments, such as forwards, involves DNO entering into contractual commitments to purchase or sell crude oil at a specified date in the future. The aggregate market value of the contracts will significantly exceed DNO's future cash requirements since DNO intends to close out its open positions prior to settlement. As a result, DNO is generally only subject to the risk of loss arising from the change in value of the contracts. DNO considers the fair value\u201d of its derivative instruments to be the unrealized gain or loss on the contracts. The market risk associated with DNO's commitments to purchase crude oil is limited to the aggregate market value of the contracts held. However, should DNO enter into a contractual commitment to sell crude oil, it would be required to make delivery of the crude oil at the contract price, repurchase the contract at prevailing prices or settle in cash. Since there are no limits on the future price of crude oil, the market risk to DNO could be unlimited.\nDNO's exposure to market risk depends on a number of factors, including the markets for crude oil, the volatility of interest rates and foreign exchange rates, the liquidity of the Futures Contracts and Other Crude Oil-Related Investments markets and the relationships among the contracts held by DNO. Drastic market occurrences could ultimately lead to the loss of all or substantially all of an investor's capital.\nCredit Risk\nWhen DNO enters into Futures Contracts and Other Crude Oil-Related Investments, it is exposed to the credit risk that the counterparty will not be able to meet its obligations. The counterparty for the Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX and on most other futures exchanges is the clearinghouse associated with the particular exchange. In general, in addition to margin required to be posted by the clearinghouse in connection with cleared trades, clearinghouses are backed by their members who may be required to share in the financial burden resulting from the nonperformance of one of their members and, therefore, this additional member support should significantly reduce credit risk. DNO is not currently a member of any clearinghouse. Some foreign exchanges are not backed by their clearinghouse members but may be backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions. There can be no assurance that any counterparty, clearinghouse, or their members or their financial backers will satisfy their obligations to DNO in such circumstances.\nUSCF attempts to manage the credit risk of DNO by following various trading limitations and policies. In particular, DNO generally posts margin and/or holds liquid assets that are approximately equal to the market value of its obligations to counterparties under the Futures Contracts and Other Crude Oil-Related Investments it holds. USCF has implemented procedures that include, but are not limited to, executing and clearing trades only with creditworthy parties and/or requiring the posting of collateral or margin by such parties for the benefit of DNO to limit its credit exposure. An FCM, when acting on behalf of DNO in accepting orders to purchase or sell Futures Contracts on United States exchanges, is required by CFTC regulations to separately account for and segregate as belonging to DNO, all assets of DNO relating to domestic Futures Contracts trading. FCMs are not allowed to commingle DNO's assets with their other assets. In addition, the CFTC requires commodity brokers to hold in a secure account DNO's assets related to foreign Futures Contracts trading.\nIn the future, DNO may purchase OTC swaps, see", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto of DNO included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nForward-Looking Information\nThis annual report on Form 10-K, including this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d contains forward-looking statements regarding the plans and objectives of management for future operations. This information may involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause DNO's actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements, which involve assumptions and describe DNO's future plans, strategies and expectations, are generally identifiable by use of the words may,\u201d will,\u201d should,\u201d expect,\u201d anticipate,\u201d estimate,\u201d believe,\u201d intend\u201d or project,\u201d the negative of these words, other variations on these words or comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that may be incorrect, and DNO cannot assure investors that the projections included in these forward-looking statements will come to pass. DNO's actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors.\nDNO has based the forward-looking statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K on information available to it on the date of this annual report on Form 10-K, and DNO assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Although DNO undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, investors are advised to consult any additional disclosures that DNO may make directly to them or through reports that DNO in the future files with the SEC, including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.\nIntroduction\nDNO, a Delaware limited partnership, is a commodity pool that issues shares that may be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca. The investment objective of DNO is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares' per share NAV to inversely reflect the daily changes, in percentage terms, of the spot price of WTI light, sweet crude oil delivered to Cushing, Oklahoma, as measured by the daily changes in the price of the futures contract for WTI light, sweet crude oil traded on the NYMEX that is the near month contract to expire, except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, in which case it will be measured by the futures contract that is the next month contract to expire (the Benchmark Futures Contract\u201d), less DNO's expenses. Near month contract\u201d means the next contract traded on the NYMEX due to expire. Next month contract\u201d means the first contract traded on the NYMEX due to expire after the near month contract.\nDNO's investment objective is not for its NAV or market price of shares to equal, in dollar terms, the inverse of the spot price of WTI light, sweet crude oil or any particular futures contract based on WTI light, sweet crude oil, nor is DNO's investment objective for the percentage change in its NAV to reflect the inverse of the percentage change of the price of any particular futures contract as measured over a time period greater than one day. USCF believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in Futures Contracts and Other Crude Oil-Related Investments.\nDNO seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing so that the average daily percentage change in DNO's NAV for any period of 30 successive valuation days will be within plus/minus ten percent (10%) of the inverse of the average daily percentage change in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract over the same period.\nThe regulation of commodity interest trading in the United States and other countries is an evolving area of the law. The various statements made in this summary are subject to modification by legislative action and changes in the rules and regulations of the SEC, FINRA, CFTC, the NFA, the futures exchanges, clearing organizations and other regulatory bodies. Pending final resolution of all applicable regulatory requirements, some examples of how new rules and regulations could impact DNO are discussed in Item 1. Business\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d in this annual report on Form 10-K.\n 41 \nPrice Movements\nCrude oil futures prices were volatile during the year ended December 31, 2017 and exhibited moderate daily swings along with an uneven upward trend during the year. The price of the Benchmark Futures Contract started the year at $53.720 per barrel. The high of the year was on December 29, 2017 when the price reached $60.420 per barrel. The low of the year was on June 21, 2017 when the price dropped to $42.530 per barrel. The year ended with the Benchmark Futures Contract at $60.420 per barrel, an increase of approximately 12.47% over the year. DNO's per share NAV began the year at $61.96 and ended the year at $56.56 on December 31, 2017, a decrease of approximately (8.72)% over the year. DNO's per share NAV reached its high for the year on June 21, 2017 at $80.19 and reached its low for the year on December 29, 2017 at $56.56. Since DNO's investment objective is to track the inverse of the daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract, the decrease in DNO's per share NAV reflects the inverse of the increase in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract. The Benchmark Futures Contract prices listed above began with the February 2017 contracts and ended with the February 2018 contracts. The increase of approximately 12.47% on the Benchmark Futures Contract listed above is a hypothetical return only and could not actually be achieved by an investor holding Futures Contracts. An investment in Futures Contracts would need to be rolled forward during the time period described in order to simulate such a result. Furthermore, the change in the nominal price of these differing Futures Contracts, measured from the start of the year to the end of the year, does not represent the actual benchmark results that DNO seeks to track, which are more fully described below in the section titled Tracking DNO's Benchmark.\u201d\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the crude oil futures market was in a state of contango, meaning that the price of the near month crude Oil Futures Contract was lower than the price of the next month crude Oil Futures Contract, or contracts further away from expiration. On days when the market is in backwardation, the price of the near month crude Oil Futures Contract is typically higher than the price of the next month crude Oil Futures Contract or contracts further away from expiration. For a discussion of the impact of backwardation and contango on total returns, see Term Structure of Crude Oil Prices and the Impact on Total Returns\u201d below.\nValuation of Futures Contracts and the Computation of the Per Share NAV\nThe per share NAV of DNO's shares is calculated once each NYSE Arca trading day. The per share NAV for a particular trading day is released after 4:00 p.m. New York time. Trading during the core trading session on the NYSE Arca typically closes at 4:00 p.m. New York time. The Administrator uses the NYMEX closing price (determined at the earlier of the close of the NYMEX or 2:30 p.m. New York time) for the contracts held on the NYMEX, but calculates or determines the value of all other DNO investments, including ICE Futures contracts or other futures contracts, as of the earlier of the close of the NYSE Arca or 4:00 p.m. New York time.\nResults of Operations and the Crude Oil Market\nResults of Operations. On September 24, 2009, DNO listed its shares on the NYSE Arca under the ticker symbol DNO.\u201d On that day, DNO established its initial offering price at $50.00 per share and issued 200,000 shares to the initial Authorized Participant, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., in exchange for $10,000,000 in cash.\nSince its initial offering of 25,000,000 shares, DNO has not registered any subsequent offerings of its shares. As of December 31, 2017, DNO had issued 4,200,000 shares, 200,000 of which were outstanding. As of December 31, 2017, there were 20,800,000 shares registered but not yet issued.\nMore shares may have been issued by DNO than are outstanding due to the redemption of shares. Unlike funds that are registered under the 1940 Act, shares that have been redeemed by DNO cannot be resold by DNO. As a result, DNO contemplates that additional offerings of its shares will be registered with the SEC in the future in anticipation of additional issuances and redemptions.\nAs of December 31, 2017, DNO had the following Authorized Participants: BNP Paribas Prime Brokerage, Inc., BNP Paribas Securities Corp., Citadel Securities LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Credit Suisse Securities USA LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Goldman Sachs & Company, JP Morgan Securities Inc., Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corporation, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Nomura Securities International Inc., RBC Capital Markets LLC, SG Americas Securities LLC, UBS Securities LLC and Virtu Financial BD LLC.\n 42 \nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016; and for the Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to the Year Ended December 31,\n\nPortfolio Expenses. DNO's expenses consist of investment management fees, brokerage fees and commissions, certain offering costs, licensing fees, registration fees, the fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF and expenses relating to tax accounting and reporting requirements. The management fee that DNO pays to USCF is calculated as a percentage of the total net assets of DNO. The fee is accrued daily and paid monthly.\nThe decrease in the per share NAV for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, was due primarily to higher prices for crude oil and the related decrease in the value of the crude oil futures contracts in which DNO held and traded; and the decrease in the per share NAV for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, was due primarily to higher prices for crude oil and the related decrease in the value of the crude oil futures contracts in which DNO held and traded.\nAverage interest rates earned on short-term investments held by DNO, including cash, cash equivalents and Treasuries, were higher during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016; and were higher during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. As a result, the amount of income earned by DNO as a percentage of average daily total net assets was higher during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016; and was higher during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. To the degree that the aggregate yield is higher, the net expense ratio, inclusive of income, will be lower.\nThe decrease in total fees and other expenses excluding management fees for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 was due primarily to DNO's smaller size as measured by total net assets and lower professional fees; and the increase in total fees and other expenses excluding management fees for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, was due primarily to higher professional fees.\nThe decrease in total commissions accrued to brokers for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, was due primarily to a lower number of futures contracts being held and traded; and the decrease in total commissions accrued to brokers for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, was due primarily to lower number of futures contracts being held and traded.\n 43 \nFor the Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Three Months Ended December 31, 2016; and for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to the Three Months Ended December 31, 2015\n\nThe decrease in the per share NAV for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016, was due primarily to higher prices for crude oil and the related decrease in the value of the crude oil futures contracts in which DNO held and traded; and the decrease in the per share NAV for the three months ended December 31, 2016, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2015, was due primarily to higher prices for crude oil and the related decrease in the value of the crude oil futures contracts in which DNO held and traded.\nAverage interest rates earned on short-term investments held by DNO, including cash, cash equivalents and Treasuries, were higher during the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016; and were higher during the three months ended December 31, 2016, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2015. As a result, the amount of income earned by DNO as a percentage of average daily total net assets was higher during the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016; and was higher during the three months ended December 31, 2016 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2015. To the degree that the aggregate yield is higher, the net expense ratio, inclusive of income, will be lower.\nThe decrease in total fees and other expenses excluding management fees for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016 was due to lower reporting and professional fees; and the decrease in total fees and other expenses excluding management fees for the three months ended December 31, 2016, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2015, was due primarily to DNO's smaller size as measured by total net assets.\nThe decrease in total commissions accrued to brokers for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016, was due primarily to a lower number of futures contracts being held and traded; and the decrease in total commissions accrued to brokers for the three months ended December 31, 2016, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2015, was due primarily to lower number of futures contracts being held and traded.\n 44 \nTracking DNO's Benchmark\nUSCF seeks to manage DNO's portfolio such that changes in its average daily per share NAV, on a percentage basis, closely inversely track the daily changes in the average price of the Benchmark Futures Contract, also on a percentage basis. Specifically, USCF seeks to manage the portfolio such that over any rolling period of 30-valuation days, the average daily change in DNO's per share NAV is within a range of (90)% to (110)% ((0.9) to (1.1)) of the average daily change in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract. As an example, if the average daily movement of the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract for a particular 30-valuation day time period was 0.50% per day, USCF would attempt to manage the portfolio such that the average daily movement of the per share NAV during that same time period fell between (0.45)% and (0.55)% (i.e., between (0.9) and (1.1) of the benchmark's results). DNO's portfolio management goals do not include trying to make the nominal price of DNO's per share NAV equal to the inverse of the nominal price of the current Benchmark Futures Contract or the inverse of the spot price for WTI light, sweet crude oil. USCF believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in short positions in Futures Contracts and Other Crude Oil-Related Investments.\nFor the 30-valuation days ended December 31, 2017, the inverse of the simple average daily change in the Benchmark Futures Contract was (0.286)%, while the simple average daily change in the per share NAV of DNO over the same time period was (0.285)%. The average daily difference was 0.001% (or 0.1 basis points, where 1 basis point equals 1/100 of 1%). As a percentage of the inverse of the daily movement of the Benchmark Futures Contract, the average error in daily tracking by the per share NAV was 0.408%, meaning that over this time period DNO's tracking error was within the plus or minus 10% range established as its benchmark tracking goal. The first chart below shows the daily movement of DNO's per share NAV versus the daily movement of the Benchmark Futures Contract for the 30-valuation day period ended December 31, 2017, the last trading day in December. The second chart below shows the monthly total returns of DNO as compared to the monthly value of the Benchmark Futures Contract for the five years ended December 31, 2017.\nSince the commencement of the offering of DNO's shares to the public on September 24, 2009 to December 31, 2017, the inverse of the simple average daily change in the Benchmark Futures Contract was 0.029%, while the simple average daily change in the per share NAV of DNO over the same time period was 0.026%. The average daily difference was (0.003)% (or (0.3) basis points, where 1 basis point equals 1/100 of 1%). As a percentage of the inverse of the daily movement of the Benchmark Futures Contract, the average error in daily tracking by the per share NAV was (0.844)%, meaning that over this time period DNO's tracking error was within the plus or minus 10% range established as its benchmark tracking goal.\n*PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS\n*PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS\n 45 \nAn alternative tracking measurement of the return performance of DNO versus the inverse of the return of its Benchmark Futures Contract can be calculated by comparing the actual return of DNO, measured by changes in its per share NAV, versus the expected changes in its per share NAV under the assumption that DNO's returns had been exactly the same as inverse to the daily changes in its Benchmark Futures Contract.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the actual total return of DNO as measured by changes in its per share NAV was (8.72)%. This is based on an initial per share NAV of $61.96 as of December 31, 2016 and an ending per share NAV as of December 31, 2017 of $56.56. During this time period, DNO made no distributions to its shareholders. However, if DNO's daily changes in its per share NAV had instead exactly inversely tracked the changes in the daily total return of the Benchmark Futures Contract, DNO would have had an estimated per share NAV of $56.54 as of December 31, 2017, for a total return over the relevant time period of (8.75)%. The difference between the actual per share NAV total return of DNO of (8.72)% and the expected total return based on the inverse of changes in the daily return of the Benchmark Futures Contract of (8.75)% was an error over the time period of 0.03%, which is to say that DNO's actual total return outperformed the inverse of the benchmark result by that percentage. DNO incurs expenses primarily composed of the management fee, brokerage commissions for the buying and selling of futures contracts, and other expenses. The impact of these expenses, offset by interest and dividend income, and net of positive or negative execution, tends to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of DNO to track slightly lower than the inverse of the daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.\nBy comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2016, the actual total return of DNO as measured by changes in its per share NAV was (23.74)%. This was based on an initial per share NAV of $81.25 as of December 31, 2015 and an ending per share NAV as of December 31, 2016 of $61.96. During this time period, DNO made no distributions to its shareholders. However, if DNO's daily changes in its per share NAV had instead exactly inversely tracked the changes in the daily total return of the Benchmark Futures Contract, DNO would have had an estimated per share NAV of $62.16 as of December 31, 2016, for a total return over the relevant time period of (23.50)%. The difference between the actual per share NAV total return of DNO of (23.74)% and the expected total return based on the inverse of changes in the daily return of the Benchmark Futures Contract of (23.50)% was an error over the time period of (0.24)%, which is to say that DNO's actual total return underperformed the inverse of the benchmark result by that percentage. DNO incurs expenses primarily composed of the management fee, brokerage commissions for the buying and selling of futures contracts, and other expenses. The impact of these expenses, offset by interest and dividend income, and net of positive or negative execution, tended to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of DNO to track slightly lower than the inverse of the daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.\nBy comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2015, the actual total return of DNO as measured by changes in its per share NAV was 45.92%. This was based on an initial per share NAV of $55.68 on December 31, 2014 and an ending per share NAV as of December 31, 2015 of $81.25. During this time period, DNO made no distributions to its shareholders. However, if DNO's daily changes in its per share NAV had instead exactly inversely tracked the changes in the daily total return of the Benchmark Futures Contract, DNO would have had an estimated per share NAV of $81.68 as of December 31, 2015, for a total return over the relevant time period of 46.70%. The difference between the actual per share NAV total return of DNO of 45.92% and the expected total return based on the inverse of changes in the daily return of the Benchmark Futures Contract of 46.70% was an error over the time period of (0.78)%, which is to say that DNO's actual total return underperformed the inverse of the benchmark result by that percentage. DNO incurs expenses primarily composed of the management fee, brokerage commissions for the buying and selling of futures contracts, and other expenses. The impact of these expenses, offset by interest and dividend income, and net of positive or negative execution, tended to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of DNO to track slightly lower than the inverse of the daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.\nThere are currently three factors that have impacted or are most likely to impact DNO's ability to accurately inversely track its Benchmark Futures Contract.\nFirst, DNO may buy or sell its holdings in the then current Benchmark Futures Contract at a price other than the closing settlement price of that contract on the day during which DNO executes the trade. In that case, DNO may pay a price that is higher, or lower, than that of the Benchmark Futures Contract, which could cause the changes in the daily per share NAV of DNO to either be too high or too low relative to the inverse of the daily changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract. During the year ended December 31, 2017, USCF attempted to minimize the effect of these transactions by seeking to execute its purchase or sale of the Benchmark Futures Contract at, or as close as possible to, the end of the day settlement price. However, it may not always be possible for DNO to obtain the closing settlement price and there is no assurance that failure to obtain the closing settlement price in the future will not adversely impact DNO's attempt to inversely track the Benchmark Futures Contract over time.\n 46 \nSecond, DNO incurs expenses primarily composed of the management fee, brokerage commissions for the buying and selling of futures contracts, and other expenses. The impact of these expenses tends to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of DNO to track slightly lower than the inverse of daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract. At the same time, DNO earns dividend and interest income on its cash, cash equivalents and Treasuries. DNO is not required to distribute any portion of its income to its shareholders and did not make any distributions to shareholders during the year ended December 31, 2017. Interest payments, and any other income, were retained within the portfolio and added to DNO's NAV. When this income exceeds the level of DNO's expenses for its management fee, brokerage commissions and other expenses (including ongoing registration fees, licensing fees and the fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF), DNO will realize a net yield that will tend to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of DNO to track slightly higher than the inverse of daily changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract. If short-term interest rates rise above the current levels, the level of deviation created by the yield would decrease. Conversely, if short-term interest rates were to decline, the amount of error created by the yield would increase. When short-term yields drop to a level lower than the combined expenses of the management fee and the brokerage commissions, then the tracking error becomes a negative number and would tend to cause the daily returns of the per share NAV to underperform the inverse of the daily returns of the Benchmark Futures Contract. USCF anticipates that interest rates may continue to increase over the near future from historical lows. However, it is anticipated that fees and expenses paid by DNO may continue to be higher than interest earned by DNO. As such, USCF anticipates that DNO will continue to underperform its benchmark until such a time when interest earned at least equals or exceeds the fees and expenses paid by DNO.\nThird, DNO may hold Other Crude Oil-Related Investments in its portfolio that may fail to closely track the inverse of the Benchmark Futures Contract's total return movements. In that case, the error in tracking the inverse of the Benchmark Futures Contract could result in daily changes in the per share NAV of DNO that are either too high, or too low, relative to the inverse of the daily changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract. During the year ended December 31, 2017, DNO did not hold any Other Crude Oil-Related Investments. If DNO increases in size, and due to its obligations to comply with regulatory limits, DNO may invest in Other Crude Oil-Related Investments which may have the effect of increasing transaction related expenses and may result in increased tracking error.\nTerm Structure of Crude Oil Futures Prices and the Impact on Total Returns. Several factors determine the total return from investing in futures contracts. One factor arises from rolling\u201d futures contracts that will expire at the end of the current month (the near\u201d or front\u201d month contract) forward each month prior to expiration. For a strategy that entails holding the near month contract, the price relationship between that futures contract and the next month futures contract will impact returns. For example, if the price of the near month futures contract is higher than the next futures month contract (a situation referred to as backwardation\u201d), then absent any other change, the price of a next month futures contract tends to rise in value as it becomes the near month futures contract and approaches expiration. Conversely, if the price of a near month futures contract is lower than the next month futures contract (a situation referred to as contango\u201d), then absent any other change, the price of a next month futures contract tends to decline in value as it becomes the near month futures contract and approaches expiration.\nAs an example, assume that the price of crude oil for immediate delivery, is $50 per barrel, and the value of a position in the near month futures contract is also $50. Over time, the price of crude oil will fluctuate based on a number of market factors, including demand for oil relative to supply. The value of the near month futures contract will likewise fluctuate in reaction to a number of market factors. If an investor seeks to maintain a position in a near month futures contract and not take delivery of physical barrels of crude oil, the investor must sell the current near month futures contract as it approaches expiration and invest in the next month futures contract. In order to continue holding a position in the current near month futures contract, this roll\u201d forward of the futures contract must be executed every month.\nContango and backwardation are natural market forces that have impacted the total return on an investment in DNO's shares during the past year relative to a hypothetical direct investment in crude oil. In the future, it is likely that the relationship between the market price of DNO's shares and changes in the spot prices of WTI light, sweet crude oil will continue to be impacted by contango and backwardation. It is important to note that this comparison ignores the potential costs associated with physically owning and storing crude oil, which could be substantial.\nIf the futures market is in backwardation, e.g., when the price of the near month futures contract is higher than the price of the next month futures contract, the investor would buy a next month futures contract for a lower price than the current near month futures contract. Assuming the price of the next month futures contract was $49 per barrel, or 2% cheaper than the $50 near month futures contract, then, hypothetically, and assuming no other changes (e.g., to either prevailing crude oil prices or the price relationship between the spot price, the near month contract and the next month contract, and, ignoring the impact of commission costs and the income earned on cash and/or cash equivalents), the value of the $49 next month futures contract would rise to $50 as it approaches expiration. In this example, the value of an investment in the next month futures contract would tend to outperform the spot price of crude oil. As a result, it would be possible for the new near month futures contract to rise 12% while the spot price of crude oil may have risen a lower amount, e.g., only 10%. Similarly, the spot price of crude oil could have fallen 10% while the value of an investment in the futures contract might have fallen another amount, e.g., only 8%. Over time, if backwardation remained constant, this difference between the spot price and the futures contract price would continue to increase.\n 47 \nIf the futures market is in contango, an investor would be buying a next month futures contract for a higher price than the current near month futures contract. Again, assuming the near month futures contract is $50 per barrel, the price of the next month futures contract might be $51 per barrel, or 2% more expensive than the front month futures contract. Hypothetically, and assuming no other changes, the value of the $51 next month futures contract would fall to $50 as it approaches expiration. In this example, the value of an investment in the second month would tend to underperform the spot price of crude oil. As a result, it would be possible for the new near month futures contract to rise only 10% while the spot price of crude oil may have risen a higher amount, e.g., 12%. Similarly, the spot price of crude oil could have fallen 10% while the value of an investment in the second month futures contract might have fallen another amount, e.g., 12%. Over time, if contango remained constant, this difference between the spot price and the futures contract price would continue to increase.\nThe chart below compares the daily price of the near month crude oil futures contract to the price of 13th month crude oil futures contract (i.e., a contract one year forward) over the last 10 years. When the price of the near month futures contract is higher than the price of the 13th month futures contract, the market would be described as being in backwardation. When the price of the near month futures contract is lower than the 13th month futures contract, the market would be described as being in contango. Although the price of the near month futures contract and the price of the 13th month futures contract tend to move together, it can be seen that at times the near month futures contract prices are higher than the 13th month futures contract prices (backwardation) and, at other times, the near month futures contract prices are lower than the 13th month futures contract prices (contango).\n*PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS\n 48 \nAn alternative way to view the same data is to subtract the dollar price of the 13th month crude oil futures contract from the dollar price of the near month crude oil futures contract, as shown in the chart below. When the difference is positive, the market is in backwardation. When the difference is negative, the market is in contango. The crude oil market spent time in both backwardation and contango during the last ten years.\n*PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS\nAn investment in a portfolio that owned only the near month crude oil futures contract would likely produce a different result than an investment in a portfolio that owned an equal number of each of the near 12 months' of crude oil futures contracts. Generally speaking, when the crude oil futures market is in backwardation, a portfolio of only the near month crude oil futures contract may tend to have a higher total return than a portfolio of 12 months' of the crude oil futures contract. Conversely, if the crude oil futures market was in contango, the portfolio containing only 12 months' of crude oil futures contracts may tend to outperform the portfolio holding only the near month crude oil futures contract.\nHistorically, the crude oil futures markets have experienced periods of contango and backwardation, with backwardation being in place roughly as often as contango since oil futures trading started in 1982. Following the global financial crisis in the fourth quarter of 2008, the crude oil market moved into contango and remained in contango for a period of several years. During parts of 2009, the level of contango was unusually steep as a combination of slack U.S. and global demand for crude oil and issues involving the physical transportation and storage of crude oil at Cushing, Oklahoma, the primary pricing point for oil traded in the U.S., led to unusually high inventories of crude oil. A combination of improved transportation and storage capacity, along with growing demand for crude oil globally, moderated the inventory build-up and led to reduced levels of contango by 2011. However, at the end of November, 2014, global crude oil inventories grew rapidly after OPEC decided to defend its market share against U.S. shale-oil producers, resulting in another period during which the crude oil market remained primarily in contango, sometimes steep contango. This period of contango continued through December 31, 2016. In addition, the crude oil markets are expected to remain in contango until U.S. and global oil inventories decline significantly. If OPEC's recent cuts in oil production have their intended effect on the crude oil market then such a decline may occur in 2017.\n 49 \nPeriods of contango or backwardation do not materially impact DNO's investment objective of having the daily percentage changes in its per share NAV track the daily percentage changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract since the impact of backwardation and contango tend to equally impact the daily percentage changes in price of both DNO's shares and the Benchmark Futures Contract. It is impossible to predict with any degree of certainty whether backwardation or contango will occur in the future. It is likely that both conditions will occur during different periods.\nCrude Oil Market. During the year ended December 31, 2017, crude oil prices have traded in a range between $42 to $60 as U.S. production growth threatened to overwhelm the impact of OPEC supply cuts. Prices rose during the third quarter as U.S. and global inventories declined. U.S. storage fell faster than the normal seasonal pace and dropped below prior-year inventory levels for the first time since 2014. U.S. production ramped up steadily throughout the year, returning to record levels last seen during summer 2015. However, production and rig count growth both appeared to level off towards the end of the quarter and may represent caution on the part of producers. Temporary disruptions also occurred as a result of hurricane Harvey. Looking ahead, expected demand growth appears strong while OPEC has stated it is prepared to take any action necessary to perpetuate the current trend towards a balanced market. Should global demand growth forecasts fail to be realized, or if OPEC is unable to counter growing U.S. production, there is a meaningful possibility that crude prices could fall again. On the other hand, increasing global tensions and the possibility of any number of conflicts escalating could lead to price shocks to the upside.\nCrude Oil Price Movements in Comparison to Other Energy Commodities and Investment Categories. USCF believes that investors frequently measure the degree to which prices or total returns of one investment or asset class move up or down in value in concert with another investment or asset class. Statistically, such a measure is usually done by measuring the correlation of the price movements of the two different investments or asset classes over some period of time. The correlation is scaled between 1 and -1, where 1 indicates that the two investment options move up or down in price or value together, known as positive correlation,\u201d and -1 indicates that they move in completely opposite directions, known as negative correlation.\u201d A correlation of 0 would mean that the movements of the two are neither positively nor negatively correlated, known as non-correlation.\u201d That is, the investment options sometimes move up and down together and other times move in opposite directions\nFor the ten-year time period between December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2017, the table below compares the monthly movements of crude oil prices versus the monthly movements of the prices of several other energy commodities, such as natural gas, diesel-heating oil, and unleaded gasoline, as well as several major non-commodity investment asset classes, such as large cap U.S. equities, U.S. government bonds and global equities. It can be seen that over this particular time period, the movement of crude oil on a monthly basis exhibited strong correlation with unleaded gasoline and diesel-heating oil, moderate correlation with the movements of large cap U.S. equities and global equities, limited correlation with natural gas, and moderate negative correlation with U.S. government bonds.\n\nSource: Bloomberg, NYMEX\n*PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS\n 50 \nThe table below covers a more recent, but much shorter, range of dates than the above table. Over the one year period ended December 31, 2017, movements of crude oil displayed strong correlation with large cap U.S. equities, global equities and diesel-heating oil and limited negative to little correlation with movements with U.S. Government bonds, unleaded gasoline and natural gas.\n\nSource: Bloomberg, NYMEX\n*PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS\nInvestors are cautioned that the historical price relationships between crude oil and various other energy commodities, as well as other investment asset classes, as measured by correlation may not be reliable predictors of future price movements and correlation results. The results pictured above would have been different if a different range of dates had been selected. USCF believes that crude oil has historically not demonstrated a strong correlation with equities or bonds over long periods of time. However, USCF also believes that in the future it is possible that crude oil could have long term correlation results that indicate prices of crude oil more closely track the movements of equities or bonds. In addition, USCF believes that, when measured over time periods shorter than ten years, there will always be some periods where the correlation of crude oil to equities and bonds will be either more strongly positively correlated or more strongly negatively correlated than the long term historical results suggest.\nThe correlations between crude oil, natural gas, diesel-heating oil and gasoline are relevant because USCF endeavors to invest DNO's assets in Futures Contracts and Other Crude Oil-Related Investments so that daily changes in percentage terms in DNO's per share NAV correlate as closely as possible with the inverse of the daily changes in percentage terms in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract. If certain other fuel-based commodity futures contracts do not closely correlate with the Benchmark Futures Contract, then their use could lead to greater tracking error. As noted above, USCF also believes that the changes in percentage terms in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract will closely correlate with changes in percentage terms in the inverse of spot price of WTI light, sweet crude oil.\n 51 \nCritical Accounting Policies\nPreparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the application of appropriate accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. DNO's application of these policies involves judgments and actual results may differ from the estimates used.\nUSCF has evaluated the nature and types of estimates that it makes in preparing DNO's financial statements and related disclosures and has determined that the valuation of its investments, which are not traded on a United States or internationally recognized futures exchange (such as forward contracts and OTC swaps) involves a critical accounting policy. The values which are used by DNO for its Futures Contracts are provided by its commodity broker who uses market prices when available, while OTC swaps are valued based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that would be received from or paid to a third party in settlement of these derivative contracts prior to their delivery date and valued on a daily basis. In addition, DNO estimates interest and dividend income on a daily basis using prevailing rates earned on its cash and cash equivalents. These estimates are adjusted to the actual amount received on a monthly basis and the difference, if any, is not considered material.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nDNO has not made, and does not anticipate making, use of borrowings or other lines of credit to meet its obligations. DNO has met, and it is anticipated that DNO will continue to meet, its liquidity needs in the normal course of business from the proceeds of the sale of its investments, or from the Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents that it intends to hold at all times. DNO's liquidity needs include: redeeming shares, providing margin deposits for its existing Futures Contracts or the purchase of additional Futures Contracts and posting collateral for its OTC swaps, if applicable, and, except as noted below, payment of its expenses, summarized below under Contractual Obligations.\u201d\nDNO currently generates cash primarily from: (i) the sale of baskets consisting of 50,000 shares ( Creation Baskets\u201d) and (ii) income earned on Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents. DNO has allocated substantially all of its net assets to trading in Crude Oil Interests. DNO invests in Crude Oil Interests to the fullest extent possible without being leveraged or unable to satisfy its current or potential margin or collateral obligations with respect to its investments in Futures Contracts and Other Crude Oil-Related Investments. A significant portion of DNO's NAV is held in Treasuries, cash and cash equivalents that are used as margin and as collateral for its trading in Crude Oil Interests. The balance of the assets is held in DNO's account at its custodian bank and in Treasuries at the FCM. Income received from DNO's investments in money market funds and Treasuries is paid to DNO. During the year ended December 31, 2017, DNO's expenses exceeded the income DNO earned and the cash earned from the sale of Creation Baskets and the redemption of Redemption Baskets. During the year ended December 31, 2016, DNO's expenses exceeded the income DNO earned and the cash earned from the sale of Creation Baskets and the redemption of Redemption Baskets. To the extent expenses exceed income, DNO's NAV will be negatively impacted.\nDNO's investments in Crude Oil Interests may be subject to periods of illiquidity because of market conditions, regulatory considerations and other reasons. For example, most commodity exchanges limit the fluctuations in futures contracts prices during a single day by regulations referred to as daily limits.\u201d During a single day, no trades may be executed at prices beyond the daily limit. Once the price of a futures contract has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit, positions in the contracts can neither be taken nor liquidated unless the traders are willing to effect trades at or within the specified daily limit. Such market conditions could prevent DNO from promptly liquidating its positions in Futures Contracts. During the year ended December 31, 2017, DNO did not purchase or liquidate any of its positions while daily limits were in effect; however, DNO cannot predict whether such an event may occur in the future.\nSince the initial offering of shares, DNO has been responsible for expenses relating to: (i) management fees, (ii) brokerage fees and commissions, (iii) licensing fees for the use of intellectual property, (iv) ongoing registration expenses in connection with offers and sales of its shares subsequent to the initial offering, (v) other expenses, including tax reporting costs, (vi) fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF and (vii) other extraordinary expenses not in the ordinary course of business, while USCF has been responsible for expenses relating to the fees of DNO's Marketing Agent, Administrator and Custodian and registration expenses relating to the initial offering of shares. If USCF and DNO are unsuccessful in raising sufficient funds to cover these respective expenses or in locating any other source of funding, DNO will terminate and investors may lose all or part of their investment.\n 52 \nMarket Risk\nTrading in Futures Contracts and Other Crude Oil-Related Investments, such as forwards, involves DNO entering into contractual commitments to purchase or sell crude oil at a specified date in the future. The aggregate market value of the contracts will significantly exceed DNO's future cash requirements since DNO intends to close out its open positions prior to settlement. As a result, DNO is generally only subject to the risk of loss arising from the change in value of the contracts. DNO considers the fair value\u201d of its derivative instruments to be the unrealized gain or loss on the contracts. The market risk associated with DNO's commitments to purchase crude oil is limited to the aggregate market value of the contracts held. However, should DNO enter into a contractual commitment to sell crude oil, it would be required to make delivery of the crude oil at the contract price, repurchase the contract at prevailing prices or settle in cash. Since there are no limits on the future price of crude oil, the market risk to DNO could be unlimited.\nDNO's exposure to market risk depends on a number of factors, including the markets for crude oil, the volatility of interest rates and foreign exchange rates, the liquidity of the Futures Contracts and Other Crude Oil-Related Investments markets and the relationships among the contracts held by DNO. Drastic market occurrences could ultimately lead to the loss of all or substantially all of an investor's capital.\nCredit Risk\nWhen DNO enters into Futures Contracts and Other Crude Oil-Related Investments, it is exposed to the credit risk that the counterparty will not be able to meet its obligations. The counterparty for the Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX and on most other futures exchanges is the clearinghouse associated with the particular exchange. In general, in addition to margin required to be posted by the clearinghouse in connection with cleared trades, clearinghouses are backed by their members who may be required to share in the financial burden resulting from the nonperformance of one of their members and, therefore, this additional member support should significantly reduce credit risk. DNO is not currently a member of any clearinghouse. Some foreign exchanges are not backed by their clearinghouse members but may be backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions. There can be no assurance that any counterparty, clearinghouse, or their members or their financial backers will satisfy their obligations to DNO in such circumstances.\nUSCF attempts to manage the credit risk of DNO by following various trading limitations and policies. In particular, DNO generally posts margin and/or holds liquid assets that are approximately equal to the market value of its obligations to counterparties under the Futures Contracts and Other Crude Oil-Related Investments it holds. USCF has implemented procedures that include, but are not limited to, executing and clearing trades only with creditworthy parties and/or requiring the posting of collateral or margin by such parties for the benefit of DNO to limit its credit exposure. An FCM, when acting on behalf of DNO in accepting orders to purchase or sell Futures Contracts on United States exchanges, is required by CFTC regulations to separately account for and segregate as belonging to DNO, all assets of DNO relating to domestic Futures Contracts trading. FCMs are not allowed to commingle DNO's assets with their other assets. In addition, the CFTC requires commodity brokers to hold in a secure account DNO's assets related to foreign Futures Contracts trading.\nIn the future, DNO may purchase OTC swaps, see",

It presents detailed analyses of DNO\u2019s financial performance, investment strategies, market trends, risk factors, and regulatory considerations.\n\nKey points include:\n\n1. **Forward-Looking Statements**: The report contains forward-looking statements regarding DNO's future operations, which involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated.\n\n2. **Investment Objective**: DNO aims to inversely reflect the daily percentage changes of the price of WTI light, sweet crude oil delivered to Cushing, Oklahoma. Its objective is conditionally based on futures contracts price movements, not on the physical commodity's spot price.\n\n3. **Performance Overview**: During the year ended December 31, 2017, crude oil futures were volatile with an upward trend, and the investment performance of DNO\u2019s per share NAV decreased by approximately 8.72%, which inversely reflects the increase in crude oil prices.\n\n4. **Market Conditions**: The report explains the impact of the futures market condition, known as contango or backwardation on returns, and acknowledges that it's uncertain which condition will prevail in the future.\n\n5. **Valuation of Investments**: The report discusses the valuation of investments not traded on an exchange, including the methodology and challenges of determining fair values for these investments.\n\n6. **Liquidity and Capital Resources**: DNO meets liquidity needs through the sale of investments or cash equivalents and generating cash by selling shares and earning investment income. The fund covers expenses primarily from these generated capitals.\n\n7. **Market and Credit Risks**: DNO is exposed to market risk, which could be unlimited if it must fulfill contracts by delivering crude oil at potentially unfavorable prices. Credit risk is managed by trading with creditworthy parties and often requiring collateral.\n\n8. **Regulatory Impacts**: The evolving regulatory landscape could affect DNO\u2019s operations, subject to legislative changes and rules by financial oversight bodies.\n\n9. **Results of Operations**: The fund's net assets, income, and earned fees are meticulously detailed comparing annual and quarterly performances over various years.\n\nThe report also elucidates the critical accounting policies affecting financial statement preparation, the liquidity and capital requirements of DNO, market risk exposure, and credit risk management.\n\nInvestors are cautioned that the history of commodity prices and correlations are not reliable indicators of futures results, and both increases and decreases in market price may impact DNO\u2019s performance."}
