MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(In thousands, expect per share amounts or otherwise indicated)\nThe objective of the following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Results of Operations and Financial Condition ( MD&A\u201d) is to help the reader understand the financial performance of AptarGroup, Inc. MD&A is presented in eight sections: Overview, Results of Operations, Liquidity and Capital Resources, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Overview of Contractual Obligations, Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements, Critical Accounting Estimates, Operations Outlook and Forward-Looking Statements. MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn MD&A, we,\u201d our,\u201d us,\u201d AptarGroup,\u201d AptarGroup, Inc.\u201d, Aptar\u201d and the Company\u201d refer to AptarGroup, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nOVERVIEW\nGENERAL\nWe are a leading global provider of a broad range of innovative packaging dispensing and sealing solutions primarily for the beauty, personal care, home care, prescription drug, consumer health care, injectables, food and beverage markets. Our creative packaging solutions enhance the convenience, safety and security of consumers around the globe and allow our customers to differentiate their products in the market.\nWe define core sales as net sales excluding acquisitions and changes in foreign currency rates. Core sales is a non-GAAP financial measure. We present this measure as supplemental information to help our investors better understand the trends in our business results over time. Our management uses core sales to evaluate our business on a consistent basis. A reconciliation of core sales growth to net sales growth, the most comparable GAAP measure, can be found on page 15.\n2015 was a challenging year with sluggish macroeconomic conditions, foreign currency translation headwinds and specific softness in several key markets. In spite of these issues, we grew the top line on a core sales basis, adapted to the softer market conditions with a Company-wide focus on cost containment and benefitted from lower input costs. As a result, we were able to improve margins and grow operating income by 6%. We also executed our balanced capital allocation strategy by deploying capital to fund internal growth projects and increasing our dividend. Just after year-end, we also announced our agreement to acquire a leading provider of all-plastic airless dispensing systems for the beauty, personal care and pharmaceutical markets.\n2015

The average U.S. dollar exchange rate strengthened significantly relative to the Euro and also strengthened relative to other currencies impacting our business, resulting in a negative currency translation impact of 12%. Therefore, sales excluding changes in foreign currency rates ( core sales\u201d) increased by 1% in 2015 compared to 2014. Core sales growth in the Pharma and Food + Beverage segments was substantially offset by a decline in core sales in the Beauty + Home segment.\nIn 2014, we reported net sales of $2.6 billion, 3% above 2013 reported net sales of $2.5 billion. The negative translation effect of 2% mainly relates to the strength of the U.S. Dollar compared to Latin American and Asian currencies as the Euro rates remained relatively stable when compared to the U.S. Dollar for the full year.

The decrease is partly due to a one-time favorable $7.4 million change in our inventory accounting principle for the inventory valuation method of certain operating entities in our North American business to the first-in first-out (FIFO) method from the last-in first-out (LIFO) method which was recorded in the second quarter of 2015. Operationally, we benefitted from our mix of products sold. Our Pharma segment sales represented a higher percentage of our overall sales in 2015 compared to 2014. This positively impacts our cost of sales percentage as margins on our pharmaceutical products typically are higher than the overall Company average. We also benefitted from lower material costs, cost savings initiatives and productivity improvements along with a positive impact from the timing delay of resin pass-throughs of approximately $8.9 million as resin prices declined significantly during 2015.\nIn 2014, our cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased to 67.6% compared to 67.8% in 2013. Positively impacting the cost of sales percentage in 2014 were the mix of products sold as the Pharma segment sales represented a higher percentage of our overall sales in 2014 compared to 2013, along with incremental cost savings from a restructuring plan to optimize certain production capacities in Europe which was fully realized in 2014. These savings were partially offset by underutilized U.S. overhead as soft demand in certain product lines negatively impacted our North American cost of sales, mainly in our Beauty + Home segment. We also incurred additional costs in Latin America as we recognized approximately $3.0 million in one-time costs related to the start-up of our Colombian operations and incurred $1.3 million of expenses related to a fire that occurred in one of our Brazilian facilities.\nSELLING, RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT AND ADMINISTRATIVE\nOur Selling, Research & Development and Administrative expenses ( SG&A\u201d) decreased approximately 8% or $32.4 million in 2015 compared to the same period a year ago. Excluding changes in foreign currency rates, SG&A increased by approximately $11.6 million compared to the same period a year ago. Cost savings initiatives were offset by higher professional fees related to our ongoing information systems implementations and approximately $1.9 million of transaction costs related to an agreement to acquire Mega Airless which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2016. We also realized higher pension costs related to lower discount rates along with other normal inflationary increases. For 2015, SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased to 15.2% compared to 14.8% of net sales in the same period of the prior year.\nIn 2014, our SG&A expenses increased approximately 5% or $19.2 million compared to the same period a year ago. Excluding changes in foreign currency rates, SG&A increased approximately $24.2 million compared to the same period a year earlier. The increase was due to several factors, including higher research and development costs mainly related to our bonded aluminum to plastic technology. We also realized higher information technology costs associated with our ongoing enterprise resource planning system roll-ins along with higher stock compensation expense. For 2014, SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased to 14.8% compared to 14.4% of net sales in the same period of the prior year.\nDEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased approximately 9% or $13.3 million in 2015. Excluding changes in foreign currency rates, depreciation and amortization increased by approximately $4.4 million compared to the same period a year ago. This increase is mainly due to our investments in new products and our global enterprise resource planning system. Depreciation and amortization as a percentage of net sales increased to 6.0% compared to 5.8% for the same period a year ago.\nIn 2014, depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately 2% or $2.3 million. Excluding changes in foreign currency rates, depreciation and amortization increased by approximately $3.6 million compared to the same period a year earlier. The investments in our new products and the continued roll-out of our global enterprise resource planning system mentioned above exceeded exceptional charges incurred in 2013. Depreciation and amortization as a percentage of net sales decreased slightly to 5.8% compared to 6.0% in 2013.\nRESTRUCTURING INITIATIVES\nOn November 1, 2012, the Company announced a plan to optimize certain capacity in Europe. Due to increased production efficiencies and to better position the Company for future growth in Europe, AptarGroup transferred and consolidated production capacity involving twelve facilities. Under the plan, two facilities closed which impacted approximately 170 employees. During 2013, we recognized $11.8 million of restructuring expenses along with $2.7 million accelerated depreciation of assets. The plan was substantially completed at the end of 2013 with total costs of approximately $19.5 million.\nTable 53: <table> <tr> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n16/ATR\n</td> <td>\n2015 Form 10-K\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOPERATING INCOME\nOperating income increased approximately $17.7 million or 6% to $324.1 million in 2015. Excluding changes in currency rates, operating income increased by approximately $57.6 million in 2015. We benefitted from the $7.4 million change in inventory accounting principle along with the strong results of our Pharma and Food + Beverage segments. We also benefitted from a positive impact from the timing delay in passing through resin cost decreases and certain cost saving initiatives driven by the segments, which were slightly offset by transaction costs related to an agreement to acquire Mega Airless. Reported operating income as a percentage of net sales increased to 14.0% in 2015 compared to 11.8% for the same period in the prior year due to the same factors mentioned above.\nIn 2014, operating income increased approximately $21.8 million or 8% to $306.4 million. Excluding changes in currency rates, operating income increased by approximately $22.7 million in 2014. 2013 results included the negative impact of the European restructuring plan charges of $11.8 million. The remaining $10.9 million increase in operating income over the prior year is due to additional operating income from our sales growth, primarily from the Pharma and Food + Beverage segments. Reported operating income as a percentage of net sales increased to 11.8% in 2014 compared to 11.3% for the same period in the prior year due to the costs associated with our European restructuring plan in 2013.\nNET OTHER EXPENSES\nNet other expenses in 2015 increased to $29.6 million compared to $20.1 million in 2014. During 2015, we incurred $13.6 million of higher interest expense related to our additional $475 million senior notes established late 2014 and early 2015 along with increased costs of our forward exchange contracts. These increases were offset by $2.9 million of gain due to an insurance recovery on the involuntary conversion of fixed assets related to a fire in one of our Brazilian facilities. In addition, 2014 net other expenses included a $1.5 million write-down on a non-controlling investment.\nIn 2014, net other expenses decreased slightly to $20.1 million compared to $20.2 million in 2013. Higher interest income and lower hedging costs were mostly offset by the recognition of a $1.5 million write-down on a non-controlling investment taken during the first quarter of 2014 to align with the current fair value.\nEFFECTIVE TAX RATE\nThe reported effective tax rate on net income for 2015 and 2014 was 32.3% and 33.1%, respectively. The lower tax rate for 2015 is attributable to the reduction of valuation allowances related to U.S. state tax credits and tax benefits associated with exceptional depreciation provisions enacted in France during 2015.\nThe reported effective tax rate on net income for 2014 and 2013 was 33.1% and 35.0%, respectively. The Company did not repatriate any earnings from foreign jurisdictions to the U.S. in 2014 and this reduced our reported effective tax rate compared to 2013.\nNET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO APTARGROUP, INC.\nWe reported net income of $199.3 million compared to $191.7 million reported in 2014 and $172.0 million reported in 2013.\nBEAUTY + HOME SEGMENT\nTable 54: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nYears Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n2014 vs. 2013\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,272,946 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,498,297 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,488,145 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(15.0) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n0.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSegment Income (1)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n98,707 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n98,368 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n109,272 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n0.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(10.0) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSegment Income as a percentage of Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n7.8 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n6.6 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n7.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 55: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSegment income is defined as earnings before net interest expense, certain corporate expenses, restructuring initiatives and income taxes.

Changes in foreign currency negatively impacted reported sales for 2015 by 13%. Core sales, which exclude changes in exchange rates, decreased 2% in 2015 compared to the prior year. Core sales to the personal care, beauty and home care markets decreased by 5%, 1% and 2%, respectively, in 2015 compared to 2014. We experienced global market softness in all regions except Asia leading to a sales decline on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. Decreases in selling prices due to contractual resin cost pass-throughs to our customers negatively impacted sales by $9.1 million. Customer tooling sales, excluding foreign currency changes, increased $8.0 million in 2015 to $36.9 million compared to $28.9 million in the prior year.\nTable 56: <table> <tr> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n17/ATR\n</td> <td>\n2015 Form 10-K\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIn 2014, net sales increased approximately 1% to $1.50 billion compared to $1.49 billion in 2013.

Core sales to the beauty market increased approximately 4% while core sales to the personal care and home care markets increased approximately 3% and 4%, respectively, in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase in beauty sales was primarily due to growth of our prestige fragrance and skin care products. Personal care increased over the prior year due to stronger sales to our personal cleansing and sun care customers while sales to the home care market increased mainly due to improved laundry care sales. Geographically, all four regions reported increases in net sales with strong core sales growth in our emerging markets along with moderate growth in Europe and the U.S. Customer tooling sales, excluding foreign currency changes, decreased in 2014 to $33.9 million compared to $37.7 million in the prior year.\nIn spite of the decrease in net sales, segment income for 2015 increased slightly to $98.7 million from $98.4 million reported in 2014. The negative impacts of foreign currency rate changes and lower product sales were more than offset by lower material costs, cost savings initiatives and improved productivity, mainly in North America. We recognized a $2.4 million negative transaction effect related to the importing of components into Latin America from different regions due to the continued devaluation of certain Latin American currencies. However, this was offset by a $5.1 million favorable impact from the timing of resin pass-throughs in 2015 primarily in North America.\nIn 2014, segment income decreased approximately 10% to $98.4 million from $109.3 million reported in 2013. Soft demand in certain product lines negatively impacted our North American region. We also recognized approximately $3.0 million in one-time costs related to the start-up of our Colombian operations. Due to the significant devaluation of certain Latin American currencies, we recognized approximately $3.3 million of negative transaction effects related to the importing of components from different regions. In addition, we incurred $1.3 million of expense related to a fire that occurred in one of our Brazilian facilities.\nPHARMA SEGMENT\nTable 57: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nYears Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n2014 vs. 2013\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n712,220 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n751,226 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n708,774 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(5.2) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n6.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSegment Income\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n210,509 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n204,698 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n189,689 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n2.8 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n7.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSegment Income as a percentage of Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n29.6 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n27.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n26.8 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales decreased approximately 5% in 2015 to $712.2 million compared to $751.2 million in 2014. Foreign currency changes negatively impacted total segment sales by 13%. Core sales, which exclude changes in exchange rates, increased 8% in 2015 compared to the prior year. Core sales to the prescription and injectables markets increased 13% and 7%, respectively, in 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year. Prescription growth was led by strong demand for allergy products in both over the counter and prescription versions in the U.S. market as well as generics in Europe. We also experienced strong demand for our Asthma/COPD metered dose inhaler aerosol valves from key branded and generics customers worldwide. Injectables grew on increased stopper and syringe component sales with strong demand in Europe, U.S., India and Latin America. Core sales to the consumer health care market were down slightly to the prior year as growth in our non-prescription nasal decongestant business was offset by the softness in Eastern Europe and customer inventory reduction plans. Customer tooling sales, excluding foreign currency changes, increased $6.0 million in 2015 to $20.3 million compared to $14.3 million in the prior year.\nIn 2014, net sales increased approximately 6% to $751.2 million compared to $708.8 million in 2013. Foreign currency changes negatively impacted total segment sales by 1%. Core sales, which exclude changes in exchange rates, increased 7% in 2014 compared to the prior year. Core sales of our products increased in each end market and geographic region we serve. Core sales to the prescription drug market increased 6% on strong demand for our metered dose inhaler valves for various asthma and COPD treatments, including new generic launches in developing regions. We continued to see strong demand for our consumer health care products, which increased 12% partially due to preservative free eye care launches in Europe using our innovative ophthalmic squeeze dispenser along with strong sales of our products used for nasal decongestant. Excluding foreign currency rate changes, sales to the injectables market increased 1%. Customer tooling sales, excluding foreign currency changes, decreased in 2014 to $16.9 million compared to $21.1 million in the prior year.\nSegment income increased approximately 3% to $210.5 million in 2015 compared to $204.7 million in 2014. This increase is mainly attributed to the higher sales volumes and improved product mix within the segment as well as cost containment initiatives. Prior year results also included a $1.5 million write-down on a non-controlling investment to align with the current fair value.\nTable 58: <table> <tr> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n18/ATR\n</td> <td>\n2015 Form 10-K\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIn 2014, segment income increased approximately 8% to $204.7 million compared to $189.7 million in 2013.

Excluding changes in foreign currency rates, sales increased 2%. Decreases in prices due to resin pass-throughs to our customers negatively impacted sales by $6.6 million while customer tooling sales, excluding foreign currency changes, decreased $11.5 million in 2015 to $15.6 million compared to $27.1 million in the prior year. Sales of our products, excluding foreign currency changes, to the food market increased 3% and core sales of our products to the beverage market increased approximately 1% in 2015 compared to the prior year. Broad based growth in the food market was partially offset by lower tooling sales of $10.9 million in 2015 compared to 2014. Beverage sales increased slightly as higher bottled water sales offset weakness in the functional drink and concentrated beverage flavorings applications.\nIn 2014, net sales increased by approximately 8% to $348.3 million compared to $323.1 million in 2013. Excluding changes in foreign currency rates, sales increased 9%. Sales of our products, excluding foreign currency changes, to the food market increased 7% and core sales of our products to the beverage market increased approximately 11% in 2014 compared to the prior year. The food sales increase was mainly due to improved sales of our products used to dispense sauces/condiments and dairy creamers. The beverage sales increase was driven by the continued success of our products used on functional beverages in the Asian region as well as growth in the concentrate beverage flavoring market in Europe. Customer tooling sales, excluding foreign currency changes, also increased in 2014 to $28.5 million compared to $27.2 million in the prior year.\nSegment income increased approximately 13% to $42.7 million in 2015 compared to $37.7 million in 2014. This increase is mainly attributed to higher product sales volumes, improved operational performance and a $3.8 million favorable impact due to the timing of resin pass-throughs.\nIn 2014, segment income increased approximately 7% to $37.7 million compared to $35.2 million in 2013. This increase is mainly driven by the increase in product sales to both the food and beverage markets.\nCORPORATE & OTHER\nCertain costs that are not allocated to our three operating business segments are classified as Corporate & Other,\u201d which is presented separately in Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Corporate & Other primarily includes certain corporate compensation, professional fees, certain information system costs and LIFO inventory adjustments (prior to our accounting change in the second quarter of 2015).\nCorporate & Other expense in 2015 decreased to $28.4 million compared to $38.3 million in 2014. This decrease is primarily due to the favorable impact of a $7.4 million change in accounting principle related to our inventory valuation method during the second quarter, $2.9 million of gain due to an insurance recovery on the involuntary conversion of fixed assets related to a fire in one of our Brazilian facilities along with the positive effect of changes in exchange rates on the translation of foreign based costs. These decreases were partially offset by $1.9 million of transaction costs related to an agreement to acquire Mega Airless.\nIn 2014, Corporate & Other expense increased slightly to $38.3 million compared to $38.0 million in 2013. The increase was mainly due to increases in professional fees associated with our legal entity reorganization project in 2014. The 2013 Corporate & Other expense included a $1.5 million adjustment for accelerated depreciation recognized on certain corporate assets in 2013.\nTable 60: <table> <tr> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n19/ATR\n</td> <td>\n2015 Form 10-K\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash flows provided by our operations and our revolving credit facility. In 2015, our operations provided cash flows that totaled $324.5 million compared to $316.3 million in 2014 and $286.1 million in 2013. The increase in cash flow from operations in 2015 is mainly due to profit growth resulting from operational improvements, cost containment efforts and lower input costs. Comparing 2014 to 2013, the increase is mainly due to lower cash used for working capital compared to the prior year.\nWe used $176.2 million in cash for investing activities during 2015, compared to $159.2 million during 2014 and $157.1 million during 2013. The increase in cash used for investing activities is due to the purchase of $32.8 million in short term investments. Short term investments reflect funds invested in a time deposit instrument with a two-year maturity. However, during the life of the investment the funds can be redeemed at any time with a 35-90 day notice. There are no penalties for early redemption. This increase in cash used for short term investments was partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures of $12.6 million. Comparing 2014 to 2013, the increase in cash used for investing activities is primarily related to the increase in capital expenditures of approximately $10.4 million during the year. We estimate that we will spend approximately $160 million (assuming current exchange rates) on capital expenditures in 2016.\nOur net cash used for financing activities in 2015 was $33.1 million compared to $20.7 million in 2014 and $67.8 million in 2013. During the fourth quarter 2015, we repurchased $13.9 million shares for retirement. Comparing 2014 to 2013, the decrease in cash used for financing activities was primarily due to an increase in our proceeds from long-term debt which was primarily used to fund share repurchases through our accelerated share repurchase program.\nCash and equivalents increased $90.1 million to $489.9 million at the end of 2015 from $399.8 million at the end of 2014. Total short and long-term interest bearing debt decreased to $819.5 million at the end of 2015 from $840.9 million at the end of 2014. The ratio of our Net Debt (interest bearing debt less cash and cash equivalents) to Net Capital (Stockholders' Equity plus Net Debt) decreased to 20.7% at the end of 2015 compared to 28.6% as of December 31, 2014.\nThe Company maintains a revolving credit facility that provides for unsecured financing of up to $300 million. Each borrowing under this credit facility will bear interest at rates based on LIBOR, prime rates or other similar rates, in each case plus an applicable margin. A facility fee on the total amount of the facility is also payable quarterly, regardless of usage. The applicable margins for borrowings under the credit facility and the facility fee percentage may change from time to time depending on changes in AptarGroup's consolidated leverage ratio. The facility matures on December 16, 2019. At December 31, 2015, there was no outstanding balance under the credit facility. The outstanding balance under the credit facility was $230 million at December 31, 2014 and is reported as notes payable in the current liabilities section of the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. We incurred approximately $0.9 million and $2.7 million in interest and fees related to this credit facility during 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nOur revolving credit facility and certain long-term obligations require us to satisfy certain financial and other covenants including:\nTable 61: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRequirement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLevel at December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nConsolidated Leverage Ratio (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMaximum of 3.50 to 1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.83 to 1.00\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nConsolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMinimum of 3.00 to 1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14.11 to 1.00\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 62: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDefinitions of ratios are included as part of the revolving credit facility agreement.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBased upon the above consolidated leverage ratio covenant, we would have the ability to borrow approximately an additional $1.7 billion before the 3.50 to 1.00 ratio requirement would be exceeded.\nOur foreign operations have historically met cash requirements with the use of internally generated cash or borrowings. These foreign subsidiaries have financing arrangements with several foreign banks to fund operations located outside the U.S., but the majority of these arrangements are uncommitted. Cash generated by foreign operations has generally been reinvested locally. The majority of our $489.9 million in cash and equivalents is located outside of the U.S. We manage our global cash requirements considering (i) available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct business, (ii) the geographic location of our liquidity needs, and (iii) the cost to access international cash balances. The repatriation of non-U.S. cash balances from certain subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences as we may be required to pay income tax on those funds. Historically, the tax consequences associated with repatriating current year earnings to the U.S. has been between 10% and 14% of the repatriated amount. We do not expect future impacts to be materially different.\nTable 63: <table> <tr> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n20/ATR\n</td> <td>\n2015 Form 10-K\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe believe we are in a strong financial position and have the financial resources to meet our business requirements in the foreseeable future. We have historically used cash flow from operations as our primary source of liquidity. Our primary uses of liquidity are to invest in equipment and facilities that are necessary to support our growth and to make acquisitions that will contribute to the achievement of our strategic objectives. We currently anticipate funding the Mega Airless acquisition using available cash on hand in Europe and an existing revolving line of credit in the U.S. Other uses of liquidity include paying dividends to shareholders and repurchasing shares of our common stock. In the event that customer demand would decrease significantly for a prolonged period of time and negatively impact cash flow from operations, we would have the ability to restrict and significantly reduce capital expenditure levels, as well as evaluate our acquisition strategy and dividend and share repurchase programs. A prolonged and significant reduction in capital expenditure levels could increase future repairs and maintenance costs as well as have a negative impact on operating margins if we were unable to invest in new innovative products.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nWe lease certain warehouse, plant and office facilities as well as certain equipment under noncancelable operating leases expiring at various dates through the year 2027. Most of the operating leases contain renewal options and certain equipment leases include options to purchase during or at the end of the lease term. Other than operating lease obligations, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. See the following section Overview of Contractual Obligations\u201d for future payments relating to operating leases.\nOVERVIEW OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nBelow is a table of our outstanding

The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in the amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB decided to defer the effective date by one year to December 15, 2017 for annual reporting periods beginning after that date. The FASB also decided to allow early adoption of the standard, but not before the original effective date of December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued an Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) intended to simplify GAAP by changing the presentation of debt issuance costs. Under the new standard, debt issuance costs will be presented as a reduction of the carrying amount of the related liability, rather than as an asset. The new treatment is consistent with debt discounts. In August 2015, the FASB issued an ASU clarifying that debt issuance costs related to line of credit arrangements can be classified as an asset and amortized ratably over the term of the line of credit arrangement. These standards are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, but early adoption is permitted. The Company does not believe that this new guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued new guidance on a customer's accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement (CCA). Previously, there was no specific GAAP guidance on accounting for such fees from the customer's perspective. Under the new standard, customers will apply the same criteria as vendors to determine whether a CCA contains a software license or is solely a service contract. This standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, but early adoption is permitted. The Company does not believe that this new guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued new guidance for simplifying the measurement of inventory. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company does not believe that this new guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued guidance simplifies the balance sheet classification of deferred taxes. The new guidance requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be presented as non-current in a classified statement of financial position. This standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Other than presentation, the Company does not believe that this new guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nOther accounting standards that have been issued by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We continually evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, intangible assets, income taxes, pensions and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on a variety of other assumptions believed to be reasonable in order to make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our Board of Directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to it in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Results of Operations and Financial Condition.\nIMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL\nIn accordance with current accounting standards, goodwill has an indefinite life and is not amortized. We evaluate our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis, or whenever indicators of impairment exist. We have determined that our business segments represent our reporting units except for Injectables which, based on our review, qualifies as a separate reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing. As of December 31, 2015, we have $310.2 million of goodwill, which is allocated as follows: $33.7 million is allocated to the Pharma reporting unit, $95.6 million is allocated to the Injectables reporting unit, $164.6 million is allocated to the Beauty + Home reporting unit and $16.3 million is allocated to the Food + Beverage reporting unit.\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n22/ATR\n</td> <td>\n2015 Form 10-K\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe believe that the accounting estimate related to determining the fair value of our reporting units is a critical accounting estimate because: (1) it is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires Company management to make assumptions about the future cash flows for each reporting unit over several years in the future, and (2) the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported on our balance sheet as well as our results of operations could be material. Management's assumptions about future cash flows for the reporting units require significant judgment and actual cash flows in the future may differ significantly from those forecasted today. The estimate for future cash flows and its impact on the impairment testing of goodwill is a critical accounting estimate for all the segments of our business.\nFor our goodwill impairment assessment we have adopted a standard that provides an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not (greater than 50 percent chance) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Such qualitative factors may include the following: macroeconomic conditions; industry and market considerations; cost factors; overall financial performance; and other relevant entity-specific events. In the absence of sufficient qualitative factors, goodwill impairment is determined utilizing a two-step process. If it is determined that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount, where necessary, goodwill will be impaired at that time.\nWe performed our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31, 2015 for each of our reporting units. Based on our qualitative assessment of macroeconomic, industry, and market events and circumstances as well as the overall financial performance of the reporting units, we determined it was more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill attributed to these reporting units was greater than its carrying amount. As such, the annual two-step impairment test was deemed not necessary to be performed for our reporting units for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS\nWe record an allowance for doubtful accounts as an estimate of the inability of our customers to make their required payments. We determine the amount of our allowance for doubtful accounts by looking at a variety of factors. First, we examine an aging report of the accounts receivable in each entity within the Company. The aging report lists past due amounts according to invoice terms. In addition, we consider historical experience with the customers, the current economic environment, the credit rating of the customers and general overall market conditions. In some countries we maintain credit insurance, which can be used in certain cases of non-payment.\nWe believe that the accounting estimate related to the allowance for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because: (1) it requires management to make assumptions about the ability to collect amounts owed from customers in the future, and (2) changes to these assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on our results of operations. The estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate for all of our segments.\nWhen we determine that a customer is unlikely to pay, we record a charge to bad debt expense in the income statement and an increase to the allowance for doubtful accounts. When it becomes certain the customer cannot pay (typically driven by the customer filing for bankruptcy) we write off the receivable by removing the accounts receivable amount and reducing the allowance for doubtful accounts accordingly. In 2015, we reduced the allowance for doubtful accounts by approximately $813 thousand and we wrote off doubtful accounts of $728 thousand. Please refer to Schedule II-Valuation and Qualifying Accounts for activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts over the past three years.\nWe had approximately $391.6 million in net accounts receivable at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2015, we had approximately $2.7 million recorded in the allowance for doubtful accounts to cover potential future customer non-payments net of any credit insurance reimbursement we would potentially recover. We believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover future non-payments of our customers. However, if economic conditions deteriorate significantly or one of our large customers was to declare bankruptcy, a larger allowance for doubtful accounts might be necessary. It is extremely difficult to estimate how much of an additional reserve would be necessary, but we expect the largest potential customer balance at any one time would not exceed $18.2 million. An additional loss of $18.2 million would reduce our Total Assets as of December 31, 2015 by approximately 0.7% and would have reduced Income Before Income Taxes by approximately 6.2%.\nIf we had been required to recognize an additional $18.2 million in bad debt expense, it would likely not have significantly affected our liquidity and capital resources because, in spite of any such additional expense, we would have been within the terms of our debt covenants.\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n23/ATR\n</td> <td>\n2015 Form 10-K\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nVALUATION OF PENSION BENEFITS\nThe benefit obligations and net periodic pension cost associated with our domestic and foreign noncontributory pension plans are determined using actuarial assumptions. Such assumptions include discount rates to reflect the time value of money, rate of employee compensation increases, demographic assumptions to determine the probability and timing of benefit payments, and the long-term rate of return on plan assets. The actuarial assumptions are based upon management's best estimates, after consulting with outside investment advisors and actuaries. Because assumptions and estimates are used, actual results could differ from expected results.\nThe discount rate is utilized principally in calculating our pension obligations, which are represented by the Accumulated Benefit Obligation (ABO) and the Projected Benefit Obligation (PBO), and in calculating net periodic benefit cost. In establishing the discount rate for our foreign plans, we review a number of relevant interest rates including Aa corporate bond yields. In establishing the discount rate for our domestic plans, we match the hypothetical duration of our plans, using a weighted average duration that is based upon projected cash payments, to a simulated bond portfolio (Citigroup Pension Index Curve). At December 31, 2015, the discount rates for our domestic and foreign plans were 4.24% and 2.10%, respectively.\nWe believe that the accounting estimates related to determining the valuation of pension benefits are critical accounting estimates because: (1) changes in them can materially affect net income, and (2) we are required to establish the discount rate and the expected return on fund assets, which are highly uncertain and require judgment. The estimates for the valuation of pension benefits are critical accounting estimates for all of our segments.\nTo the extent the discount rates increase (or decrease), our PBO and net periodic benefit cost will decrease (or increase) accordingly. The estimated effect of a 1% decrease in each discount rate would be a $49.3 million increase in the PBO ($35.6 million for the domestic plans and $13.7 million for the foreign plans) and a $7.2 million increase in net periodic benefit cost ($6.1 million for the domestic plans and $1.1 million for the foreign plans). To the extent the PBO increases, the after-tax effect of such increase could reduce Other Comprehensive Income and Stockholders' Equity. The estimated effect of a 1% increase in each discount rate would be a $38.2 million decrease in the PBO ($27.3 million for the domestic plans and $10.9 million for the foreign plans) and a $5.6 million decrease in net periodic benefit cost ($4.7 million for the domestic plans and $0.9 million for the foreign plans). A decrease of this magnitude in the PBO would eliminate the current year reduction recognized in Other Comprehensive Income and Stockholders' Equity as related to pension assumptions.\nThe assumed expected long-term rate of return on assets is the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested to provide for the benefits included in the PBO. Of domestic plan assets, approximately 47% was invested in equities, 30% was invested in fixed income securities, 1% was invested in money market funds, 14% was invested in hedge funds and 8% was invested in infrastructure securities at December 31, 2015. Of foreign plan assets, approximately 89% was invested in investment funds, 3% was invested in corporate securities, 1% was invested in fixed income securities, 4% was invested in equity securities and 3% was invested in cash at December 31, 2015.\nThe expected long-term rate of return assumptions are determined based on our investment policy combined with expected risk premiums of equities and fixed income securities over the underlying risk-free rate. This rate is utilized principally in calculating the expected return on the plan assets component of the net periodic benefit cost. To the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the course of a year is greater or less than the assumed rate, that year's net periodic benefit cost is not affected. Rather, this gain (or loss) reduces (or increases) future net periodic benefit cost over a period of approximately 15 to 20 years. To the extent the expected long-term rate of return on assets increases (or decreases), our net periodic benefit cost will decrease (or increase) accordingly. The estimated effect of a 1% decrease (or increase) in each expected long-term rate of return on assets would be a $1.6 million increase (or decrease) in net periodic benefit cost.\nThe average rate of compensation increase is utilized principally in calculating the PBO and the net periodic benefit cost. The estimated effect of a 0.5% decrease in each rate of expected compensation increase would be a $5.8 million decrease in the PBO ($1.5 million for the domestic plans and $4.3 million for the foreign plans) and a $1.1 million decrease to the net periodic benefit cost. The estimated effect of a 0.5% increase in each rate of expected compensation increase would be a $6.2 million increase in the PBO ($1.6 million for the domestic plans and $4.6 million for the foreign plans) and a $1.2 million increase to the net periodic benefit cost.\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n24/ATR\n</td> <td>\n2015 Form 10-K\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOur primary pension related assumptions as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 were as follows:\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nActuarial Assumptions as of December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDiscount rate:\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDomestic plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4.24 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n3.83 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n4.75 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nForeign plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.10 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n1.90 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n3.24 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nExpected long-term rate of return on plan assets:\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDomestic plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7.00 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n7.00 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n7.00 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nForeign plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.66 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n3.54 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n3.79 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRate of compensation increase:\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDomestic plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4.00 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n4.00 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n4.00 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nForeign plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.00 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n3.00 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n3.00 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn order to determine the 2016 net periodic benefit cost, the Company expects to use the discount rates, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets and rates of compensation increase assumptions as of December 31, 2015. The estimated impact of the changes to the assumptions as noted in the table above on our 2016 net periodic benefit cost is expected to be a decrease of approximately $2.8 million.\nSHARE-BASED COMPENSATION\nThe Company uses the Black-Scholes option-valuation model to value stock options, which requires the input of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them ( expected term\u201d), the estimated volatility of the Company's stock price, risk-free interest rate, the expected dividend yield and stock price. The expected term of the options is based on historical experience of similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior. The expected term determines the period for which the risk-free interest rate and volatility must be applied. The risk-free interest rate is based on the expected U.S. Treasury rate over the expected term. Expected stock price volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company's stock price. Dividend yield is management's long-term estimate of annual dividends to be paid as a percentage of share price.\nFor 2015, expense related to share-based compensation for employee stock option plans was $17.9 million. Future changes in the subjective assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-valuation model or estimates associated with forfeitures could impact our share-based compensation expense. For example, a one year reduction in the expected term of the options would decrease the Black-Scholes valuation and reduce share-based compensation by approximately $0.6 million. In comparison, a one year increase in the expected term of the option would increase the Black-Scholes valuation and increase share-based compensation by approximately $0.5 million. In addition, changes in the share price at the date of the grant would impact our share-based compensation expense. For example, a $5 decrease in the stock price would decrease the Black-Scholes valuation and reduce share-based compensation by approximately $0.8 million. In comparison, a $5 increase in the share price would increase the Black-Scholes valuation and increase share-based compensation by approximately $0.8 million.\nOPERATIONS OUTLOOK\nWe don't anticipate significant changes in the various macro challenges that we are facing in the first quarter of 2016. The foreign currency exchange environment is expected to continue to be volatile and will impact our reported results. We will remain flexible to adapt to changing market conditions with a continued focus on containing costs while we invest in innovation and new solutions that will help our customers grow their businesses.\nAptarGroup expects earnings per share for the first quarter, excluding any impacts from costs associated with the Mega Airless acquisition, to be in the range of $0.69 to $0.74 per share compared to $0.70 per share reported in the prior year. Assuming a comparable foreign currency exchange rate environment, comparable earnings per share for the prior year would have been approximately $0.68 per share.\nTable 76: <table> <tr> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n25/ATR\n</td> <td>\n2015 Form 10-K\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nCertain statements in Management's Discussion and Analysis and other sections of this Form 10-K are forward-looking and involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including certain statements set forth in the Liquidity and Capital Resources, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, and Operations Outlook sections of this Form 10-K.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(In thousands, expect per share amounts or otherwise indicated)\nThe objective of the following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Results of Operations and Financial Condition ( MD&A\u201d) is to help the reader understand the financial performance of AptarGroup, Inc. MD&A is presented in eight sections: Overview, Results of Operations, Liquidity and Capital Resources, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Overview of Contractual Obligations, Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements, Critical Accounting Estimates, Operations Outlook and Forward-Looking Statements. MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn MD&A, we,\u201d our,\u201d us,\u201d AptarGroup,\u201d AptarGroup, Inc.\u201d, Aptar\u201d and the Company\u201d refer to AptarGroup, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nOVERVIEW\nGENERAL\nWe are a leading global provider of a broad range of innovative packaging dispensing and sealing solutions primarily for the beauty, personal care, home care, prescription drug, consumer health care, injectables, food and beverage markets. Our creative packaging solutions enhance the convenience, safety and security of consumers around the globe and allow our customers to differentiate their products in the market.\nWe define core sales as net sales excluding acquisitions and changes in foreign currency rates. Core sales is a non-GAAP financial measure. We present this measure as supplemental information to help our investors better understand the trends in our business results over time. Our management uses core sales to evaluate our business on a consistent basis. A reconciliation of core sales growth to net sales growth, the most comparable GAAP measure, can be found on page 15.\n2015 was a challenging year with sluggish macroeconomic conditions, foreign currency translation headwinds and specific softness in several key markets. In spite of these issues, we grew the top line on a core sales basis, adapted to the softer market conditions with a Company-wide focus on cost containment and benefitted from lower input costs. As a result, we were able to improve margins and grow operating income by 6%. We also executed our balanced capital allocation strategy by deploying capital to fund internal growth projects and increasing our dividend. Just after year-end, we also announced our agreement to acquire a leading provider of all-plastic airless dispensing systems for the beauty, personal care and pharmaceutical markets.\n2015 HIGHLIGHTS\n \u00b7 We achieved record annual net income and earnings per share. \n \u00b7 Core sales increased 1%, while reported sales decreased 11% largely due to changes in foreign currency translation rates. \n \u00b7 Performance of our Pharma and Food + Beverage segments offset certain softness in our Beauty + Home segment. \n \u00b7 Lower material costs, cost savings initiatives and productivity improvements drove margin improvements across all three segments. \n \u00b7 We paid increased annual dividends for the 22nd consecutive year (current annualized dividend is $1.20 per share). \nTable 48: <table> <tr> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n14/ATR\n</td> <td>\n2015 Form 10-K\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nRESULTS OF

The average U.S. dollar exchange rate strengthened significantly relative to the Euro and also strengthened relative to other currencies impacting our business, resulting in a negative currency translation impact of 12%. Therefore, sales excluding changes in foreign currency rates ( core sales\u201d) increased by 1% in 2015 compared to 2014. Core sales growth in the Pharma and Food + Beverage segments was substantially offset by a decline in core sales in the Beauty + Home segment.\nIn 2014, we reported net sales of $2.6 billion, 3% above 2013 reported net sales of $2.5 billion. The negative translation effect of 2% mainly relates to the strength of the U.S. Dollar compared to Latin American and Asian currencies as the Euro rates remained relatively stable when compared to the U.S. Dollar for the full year. All three operating segments saw core sales increases in 2014, but the consolidated 5% core sales growth was mainly driven by the strong results of our Food + Beverage and Pharma segments.\nTable 50: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet Sales Change versus Prior Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCore Sales Growth\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nForeign Currency Effects\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(12) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(2) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal Reported Net Sales Growth\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(11) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nForeign currency effects are approximations of the adjustment necessary to state the prior year net sales using current period exchange rates.

The decrease is partly due to a one-time favorable $7.4 million change in our inventory accounting principle for the inventory valuation method of certain operating entities in our North American business to the first-in first-out (FIFO) method from the last-in first-out (LIFO) method which was recorded in the second quarter of 2015. Operationally, we benefitted from our mix of products sold. Our Pharma segment sales represented a higher percentage of our overall sales in 2015 compared to 2014. This positively impacts our cost of sales percentage as margins on our pharmaceutical products typically are higher than the overall Company average. We also benefitted from lower material costs, cost savings initiatives and productivity improvements along with a positive impact from the timing delay of resin pass-throughs of approximately $8.9 million as resin prices declined significantly during 2015.\nIn 2014, our cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased to 67.6% compared to 67.8% in 2013. Positively impacting the cost of sales percentage in 2014 were the mix of products sold as the Pharma segment sales represented a higher percentage of our overall sales in 2014 compared to 2013, along with incremental cost savings from a restructuring plan to optimize certain production capacities in Europe which was fully realized in 2014. These savings were partially offset by underutilized U.S. overhead as soft demand in certain product lines negatively impacted our North American cost of sales, mainly in our Beauty + Home segment. We also incurred additional costs in Latin America as we recognized approximately $3.0 million in one-time costs related to the start-up of our Colombian operations and incurred $1.3 million of expenses related to a fire that occurred in one of our Brazilian facilities.\nSELLING, RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT AND ADMINISTRATIVE\nOur Selling, Research & Development and Administrative expenses ( SG&A\u201d) decreased approximately 8% or $32.4 million in 2015 compared to the same period a year ago. Excluding changes in foreign currency rates, SG&A increased by approximately $11.6 million compared to the same period a year ago. Cost savings initiatives were offset by higher professional fees related to our ongoing information systems implementations and approximately $1.9 million of transaction costs related to an agreement to acquire Mega Airless which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2016. We also realized higher pension costs related to lower discount rates along with other normal inflationary increases. For 2015, SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased to 15.2% compared to 14.8% of net sales in the same period of the prior year.\nIn 2014, our SG&A expenses increased approximately 5% or $19.2 million compared to the same period a year ago. Excluding changes in foreign currency rates, SG&A increased approximately $24.2 million compared to the same period a year earlier. The increase was due to several factors, including higher research and development costs mainly related to our bonded aluminum to plastic technology. We also realized higher information technology costs associated with our ongoing enterprise resource planning system roll-ins along with higher stock compensation expense. For 2014, SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased to 14.8% compared to 14.4% of net sales in the same period of the prior year.\nDEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased approximately 9% or $13.3 million in 2015. Excluding changes in foreign currency rates, depreciation and amortization increased by approximately $4.4 million compared to the same period a year ago. This increase is mainly due to our investments in new products and our global enterprise resource planning system. Depreciation and amortization as a percentage of net sales increased to 6.0% compared to 5.8% for the same period a year ago.\nIn 2014, depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately 2% or $2.3 million. Excluding changes in foreign currency rates, depreciation and amortization increased by approximately $3.6 million compared to the same period a year earlier. The investments in our new products and the continued roll-out of our global enterprise resource planning system mentioned above exceeded exceptional charges incurred in 2013. Depreciation and amortization as a percentage of net sales decreased slightly to 5.8% compared to 6.0% in 2013.\nRESTRUCTURING INITIATIVES\nOn November 1, 2012, the Company announced a plan to optimize certain capacity in Europe. Due to increased production efficiencies and to better position the Company for future growth in Europe, AptarGroup transferred and consolidated production capacity involving twelve facilities. Under the plan, two facilities closed which impacted approximately 170 employees. During 2013, we recognized $11.8 million of restructuring expenses along with $2.7 million accelerated depreciation of assets. The plan was substantially completed at the end of 2013 with total costs of approximately $19.5 million.\nTable 53: <table> <tr> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n16/ATR\n</td> <td>\n2015 Form 10-K\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOPERATING INCOME\nOperating income increased approximately $17.7 million or 6% to $324.1 million in 2015. Excluding changes in currency rates, operating income increased by approximately $57.6 million in 2015. We benefitted from the $7.4 million change in inventory accounting principle along with the strong results of our Pharma and Food + Beverage segments. We also benefitted from a positive impact from the timing delay in passing through resin cost decreases and certain cost saving initiatives driven by the segments, which were slightly offset by transaction costs related to an agreement to acquire Mega Airless. Reported operating income as a percentage of net sales increased to 14.0% in 2015 compared to 11.8% for the same period in the prior year due to the same factors mentioned above.\nIn 2014, operating income increased approximately $21.8 million or 8% to $306.4 million. Excluding changes in currency rates, operating income increased by approximately $22.7 million in 2014. 2013 results included the negative impact of the European restructuring plan charges of $11.8 million. The remaining $10.9 million increase in operating income over the prior year is due to additional operating income from our sales growth, primarily from the Pharma and Food + Beverage segments. Reported operating income as a percentage of net sales increased to 11.8% in 2014 compared to 11.3% for the same period in the prior year due to the costs associated with our European restructuring plan in 2013.\nNET OTHER EXPENSES\nNet other expenses in 2015 increased to $29.6 million compared to $20.1 million in 2014. During 2015, we incurred $13.6 million of higher interest expense related to our additional $475 million senior notes established late 2014 and early 2015 along with increased costs of our forward exchange contracts. These increases were offset by $2.9 million of gain due to an insurance recovery on the involuntary conversion of fixed assets related to a fire in one of our Brazilian facilities. In addition, 2014 net other expenses included a $1.5 million write-down on a non-controlling investment.\nIn 2014, net other expenses decreased slightly to $20.1 million compared to $20.2 million in 2013. Higher interest income and lower hedging costs were mostly offset by the recognition of a $1.5 million write-down on a non-controlling investment taken during the first quarter of 2014 to align with the current fair value.\nEFFECTIVE TAX RATE\nThe reported effective tax rate on net income for 2015 and 2014 was 32.3% and 33.1%, respectively. The lower tax rate for 2015 is attributable to the reduction of valuation allowances related to U.S. state tax credits and tax benefits associated with exceptional depreciation provisions enacted in France during 2015.\nThe reported effective tax rate on net income for 2014 and 2013 was 33.1% and 35.0%, respectively. The Company did not repatriate any earnings from foreign jurisdictions to the U.S. in 2014 and this reduced our reported effective tax rate compared to 2013.\nNET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO APTARGROUP, INC.\nWe reported net income of $199.3 million compared to $191.7 million reported in 2014 and $172.0 million reported in 2013.\nBEAUTY + HOME SEGMENT\nTable 54: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nYears Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n2014 vs. 2013\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,272,946 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,498,297 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,488,145 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(15.0) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n0.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSegment Income (1)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n98,707 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n98,368 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n109,272 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n0.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(10.0) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSegment Income as a percentage of Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n7.8 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n6.6 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n7.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Segment income is defined as earnings before net interest expense, certain corporate expenses, restructuring initiatives and income taxes.

Changes in foreign currency negatively impacted reported sales for 2015 by 13%. Core sales, which exclude changes in exchange rates, decreased 2% in 2015 compared to the prior year. Core sales to the personal care, beauty and home care markets decreased by 5%, 1% and 2%, respectively, in 2015 compared to 2014. We experienced global market softness in all regions except Asia leading to a sales decline on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. Decreases in selling prices due to contractual resin cost pass-throughs to our customers negatively impacted sales by $9.1 million. Customer tooling sales, excluding foreign currency changes, increased $8.0 million in 2015 to $36.9 million compared to $28.9 million in the prior year.\nTable 56: <table> <tr> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n17/ATR\n</td> <td>\n2015 Form 10-K\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIn 2014, net sales increased approximately 1% to $1.50 billion compared to $1.49 billion in 2013. Changes in foreign currency negatively impacted reported sales for 2014 by 2%. Core sales, which exclude changes in exchange rates, increased 3% in 2014 compared to the prior year. Core sales to the beauty market increased approximately 4% while core sales to the personal care and home care markets increased approximately 3% and 4%, respectively, in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase in beauty sales was primarily due to growth of our prestige fragrance and skin care products. Personal care increased over the prior year due to stronger sales to our personal cleansing and sun care customers while sales to the home care market increased mainly due to improved laundry care sales. Geographically, all four regions reported increases in net sales with strong core sales growth in our emerging markets along with moderate growth in Europe and the U.S. Customer tooling sales, excluding foreign currency changes, decreased in 2014 to $33.9 million compared to $37.7 million in the prior year.\nIn spite of the decrease in net sales, segment income for 2015 increased slightly to $98.7 million from $98.4 million reported in 2014. The negative impacts of foreign currency rate changes and lower product sales were more than offset by lower material costs, cost savings initiatives and improved productivity, mainly in North America. We recognized a $2.4 million negative transaction effect related to the importing of components into Latin America from different regions due to the continued devaluation of certain Latin American currencies. However, this was offset by a $5.1 million favorable impact from the timing of resin pass-throughs in 2015 primarily in North America.\nIn 2014, segment income decreased approximately 10% to $98.4 million from $109.3 million reported in 2013. Soft demand in certain product lines negatively impacted our North American region. We also recognized approximately $3.0 million in one-time costs related to the start-up of our Colombian operations. Due to the significant devaluation of certain Latin American currencies, we recognized approximately $3.3 million of negative transaction effects related to the importing of components from different regions. In addition, we incurred $1.3 million of expense related to a fire that occurred in one of our Brazilian facilities.\nPHARMA SEGMENT\nTable 57: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nYears Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n2014 vs. 2013\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n712,220 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n751,226 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n708,774 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(5.2) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n6.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSegment Income\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n210,509 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n204,698 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n189,689 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n2.8 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n7.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSegment Income as a percentage of Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n29.6 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n27.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n26.8 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales decreased approximately 5% in 2015 to $712.2 million compared to $751.2 million in 2014.

Injectables grew on increased stopper and syringe component sales with strong demand in Europe, U.S., India and Latin America. Core sales to the consumer health care market were down slightly to the prior year as growth in our non-prescription nasal decongestant business was offset by the softness in Eastern Europe and customer inventory reduction plans.

Core sales to the prescription drug market increased 6% on strong demand for our metered dose inhaler valves for various asthma and COPD treatments, including new generic launches in developing regions. We continued to see strong demand for our consumer health care products, which increased 12% partially due to preservative free eye care launches in Europe using our innovative ophthalmic squeeze dispenser along with strong sales of our products used for nasal decongestant.

This increase is mainly attributed to higher product sales volumes, improved operational performance and a $3.8 million favorable impact due to the timing of resin pass-throughs.\nIn 2014, segment income increased approximately 7% to $37.7 million compared to $35.2 million in 2013. This increase is mainly driven by the increase in product sales to both the food and beverage markets.\nCORPORATE & OTHER\nCertain costs that are not allocated to our three operating business segments are classified as Corporate & Other,\u201d which is presented separately in Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Corporate & Other primarily includes certain corporate compensation, professional fees, certain information system costs and LIFO inventory adjustments (prior to our accounting change in the second quarter of 2015).\nCorporate & Other expense in 2015 decreased to $28.4 million compared to $38.3 million in 2014. This decrease is primarily due to the favorable impact of a $7.4 million change in accounting principle related to our inventory valuation method during the second quarter, $2.9 million of gain due to an insurance recovery on the involuntary conversion of fixed assets related to a fire in one of our Brazilian facilities along with the positive effect of changes in exchange rates on the translation of foreign based costs. These decreases were partially offset by $1.9 million of transaction costs related to an agreement to acquire Mega Airless.\nIn 2014, Corporate & Other expense increased slightly to $38.3 million compared to $38.0 million in 2013. The increase was mainly due to increases in professional fees associated with our legal entity reorganization project in 2014. The 2013 Corporate & Other expense included a $1.5 million adjustment for accelerated depreciation recognized on certain corporate assets in 2013.\nTable 60: <table> <tr> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n19/ATR\n</td> <td>\n2015 Form 10-K\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash flows provided by our operations and our revolving credit facility. In 2015, our operations provided cash flows that totaled $324.5 million compared to $316.3 million in 2014 and $286.1 million in 2013. The increase in cash flow from operations in 2015 is mainly due to profit growth resulting from operational improvements, cost containment efforts and lower input costs. Comparing 2014 to 2013, the increase is mainly due to lower cash used for working capital compared to the prior year.\nWe used $176.2 million in cash for investing activities during 2015, compared to $159.2 million during 2014 and $157.1 million during 2013. The increase in cash used for investing activities is due to the purchase of $32.8 million in short term investments. Short term investments reflect funds invested in a time deposit instrument with a two-year maturity. However, during the life of the investment the funds can be redeemed at any time with a 35-90 day notice. There are no penalties for early redemption. This increase in cash used for short term investments was partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures of $12.6 million. Comparing 2014 to 2013, the increase in cash used for investing activities is primarily related to the increase in capital expenditures of approximately $10.4 million during the year. We estimate that we will spend approximately $160 million (assuming current exchange rates) on capital expenditures in 2016.\nOur net cash used for financing activities in 2015 was $33.1 million compared to $20.7 million in 2014 and $67.8 million in 2013. During the fourth quarter 2015, we repurchased $13.9 million shares for retirement. Comparing 2014 to 2013, the decrease in cash used for financing activities was primarily due to an increase in our proceeds from long-term debt which was primarily used to fund share repurchases through our accelerated share repurchase program.\nCash and equivalents increased $90.1 million to $489.9 million at the end of 2015 from $399.8 million at the end of 2014. Total short and long-term interest bearing debt decreased to $819.5 million at the end of 2015 from $840.9 million at the end of 2014. The ratio of our Net Debt (interest bearing debt less cash and cash equivalents) to Net Capital (Stockholders' Equity plus Net Debt) decreased to 20.7% at the end of 2015 compared to 28.6% as of December 31, 2014.\nThe Company maintains a revolving credit facility that provides for unsecured financing of up to $300 million. Each borrowing under this credit facility will bear interest at rates based on LIBOR, prime rates or other similar rates, in each case plus an applicable margin. A facility fee on the total amount of the facility is also payable quarterly, regardless of usage. The applicable margins for borrowings under the credit facility and the facility fee percentage may change from time to time depending on changes in AptarGroup's consolidated leverage ratio. The facility matures on December 16, 2019. At December 31, 2015, there was no outstanding balance under the credit facility. The outstanding balance under the credit facility was $230 million at December 31, 2014 and is reported as notes payable in the current liabilities section of the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. We incurred approximately $0.9 million and $2.7 million in interest and fees related to this credit facility during 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nOur revolving credit facility and certain long-term obligations require us to satisfy certain financial and other covenants including:\nTable 61: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRequirement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLevel at December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nConsolidated Leverage Ratio (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMaximum of 3.50 to 1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.83 to 1.00\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nConsolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMinimum of 3.00 to 1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14.11 to 1.00\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Definitions of ratios are included as part of the revolving credit facility agreement. \nBased upon the above consolidated leverage ratio covenant, we would have the ability to borrow approximately an additional $1.7 billion before the 3.50 to 1.00 ratio requirement would be exceeded.\nOur foreign operations have historically met cash requirements with the use of internally generated cash or borrowings. These foreign subsidiaries have financing arrangements with several foreign banks to fund operations located outside the U.S., but the majority of these arrangements are uncommitted. Cash generated by foreign operations has generally been reinvested locally. The majority of our $489.9 million in cash and equivalents is located outside of the U.S. We manage our global cash requirements considering (i) available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct business, (ii) the geographic location of our liquidity needs, and (iii) the cost to access international cash balances. The repatriation of non-U.S. cash balances from certain subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences as we may be required to pay income tax on those funds. Historically, the tax consequences associated with repatriating current year earnings to the U.S. has been between 10% and 14% of the repatriated amount. We do not expect future impacts to be materially different.\nTable 63: <table> <tr> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n20/ATR\n</td> <td>\n2015 Form 10-K\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe believe we are in a strong financial position and have the financial resources to meet our business requirements in the foreseeable future. We have historically used cash flow from operations as our primary source of liquidity. Our primary uses of liquidity are to invest in equipment and facilities that are necessary to support our growth and to make acquisitions that will contribute to the achievement of our strategic objectives. We currently anticipate funding the Mega Airless acquisition using available cash on hand in Europe and an existing revolving line of credit in the U.S. Other uses of liquidity include paying dividends to shareholders and repurchasing shares of our common stock. In the event that customer demand would decrease significantly for a prolonged period of time and negatively impact cash flow from operations, we would have the ability to restrict and significantly reduce capital expenditure levels, as well as evaluate our acquisition strategy and dividend and share repurchase programs. A prolonged and significant reduction in capital expenditure levels could increase future repairs and maintenance costs as well as have a negative impact on operating margins if we were unable to invest in new innovative products.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nWe lease certain warehouse, plant and office facilities as well as certain equipment under noncancelable operating leases expiring at various dates through the year 2027. Most of the operating leases contain renewal options and certain equipment leases include options to purchase during or at the end of the lease term. Other than operating lease obligations, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. See the following section Overview of Contractual Obligations\u201d for future payments relating to operating leases.\nOVERVIEW OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nBelow is a table of our outstanding

Notes payable mainly includes local, non-U.S. short-term borrowings. The future payments listed above assume that no additional amounts will be drawn under this credit facility. \n (3) Purchase obligations are agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transactions. \n (4) Approximately 0.2% of our total interest bearing long-term debt has variable interest rates. Using our long-term variable rate debt outstanding as of December 31, 2015 of approximately $1.2 million at an average rate of approximately 7.6%, we included approximately $0.1 million of variable interest rate obligations in 2015. No variable interest rate obligations were included in subsequent years. \n (5) This line represents the required minimum pension contribution obligation for the Company's U.S. plans. At this time, the Company is not required to make a contribution. The Company also makes contributions to its foreign pension plans but amounts are expected to be discretionary in 2016 and future years. Therefore amounts related to these plans are not included in the preceding table. \n (6) This line represents the current portion of the liability for uncertain tax positions. Aside from deferred income taxes, we have approximately $94.1 million of other deferred long-term liabilities on the balance sheet, which consist primarily of retirement plan obligations as described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the long-term payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time. Therefore, the long-term portion of the liability is excluded from the preceding table. \nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nWe have reviewed the recently issued accounting standards updates to the Financial Accounting Standards Board's ( FASB's\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification that have future effective dates. Standards which are effective for 2015 are discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n21/ATR\n</td> <td>\n2015 Form 10-K\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIn May 2014, the FASB amended the guidance for recognition of revenue from customer contracts. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in the amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB decided to defer the effective date by one year to December 15, 2017 for annual reporting periods beginning after that date. The FASB also decided to allow early adoption of the standard, but not before the original effective date of December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued an Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) intended to simplify GAAP by changing the presentation of debt issuance costs. Under the new standard, debt issuance costs will be presented as a reduction of the carrying amount of the related liability, rather than as an asset. The new treatment is consistent with debt discounts. In August 2015, the FASB issued an ASU clarifying that debt issuance costs related to line of credit arrangements can be classified as an asset and amortized ratably over the term of the line of credit arrangement. These standards are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, but early adoption is permitted. The Company does not believe that this new guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued new guidance on a customer's accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement (CCA). Previously, there was no specific GAAP guidance on accounting for such fees from the customer's perspective. Under the new standard, customers will apply the same criteria as vendors to determine whether a CCA contains a software license or is solely a service contract. This standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, but early adoption is permitted. The Company does not believe that this new guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued new guidance for simplifying the measurement of inventory. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company does not believe that this new guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued guidance simplifies the balance sheet classification of deferred taxes. The new guidance requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be presented as non-current in a classified statement of financial position. This standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Other than presentation, the Company does not believe that this new guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nOther accounting standards that have been issued by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We continually evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, intangible assets, income taxes, pensions and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on a variety of other assumptions believed to be reasonable in order to make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our Board of Directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to it in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Results of Operations and Financial Condition.\nIMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL\nIn accordance with current accounting standards, goodwill has an indefinite life and is not amortized. We evaluate our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis, or whenever indicators of impairment exist. We have determined that our business segments represent our reporting units except for Injectables which, based on our review, qualifies as a separate reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing. As of December 31, 2015, we have $310.2 million of goodwill, which is allocated as follows: $33.7 million is allocated to the Pharma reporting unit, $95.6 million is allocated to the Injectables reporting unit, $164.6 million is allocated to the Beauty + Home reporting unit and $16.3 million is allocated to the Food + Beverage reporting unit.\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n22/ATR\n</td> <td>\n2015 Form 10-K\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe believe that the accounting estimate related to determining the fair value of our reporting units is a critical accounting estimate because: (1) it is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires Company management to make assumptions about the future cash flows for each reporting unit over several years in the future, and (2) the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported on our balance sheet as well as our results of operations could be material. Management's assumptions about future cash flows for the reporting units require significant judgment and actual cash flows in the future may differ significantly from those forecasted today. The estimate for future cash flows and its impact on the impairment testing of goodwill is a critical accounting estimate for all the segments of our business.\nFor our goodwill impairment assessment we have adopted a standard that provides an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not (greater than 50 percent chance) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Such qualitative factors may include the following: macroeconomic conditions; industry and market considerations; cost factors; overall financial performance; and other relevant entity-specific events. In the absence of sufficient qualitative factors, goodwill impairment is determined utilizing a two-step process. If it is determined that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount, where necessary, goodwill will be impaired at that time.\nWe performed our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31, 2015 for each of our reporting units. Based on our qualitative assessment of macroeconomic, industry, and market events and circumstances as well as the overall financial performance of the reporting units, we determined it was more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill attributed to these reporting units was greater than its carrying amount. As such, the annual two-step impairment test was deemed not necessary to be performed for our reporting units for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS\nWe record an allowance for doubtful accounts as an estimate of the inability of our customers to make their required payments. We determine the amount of our allowance for doubtful accounts by looking at a variety of factors. First, we examine an aging report of the accounts receivable in each entity within the Company. The aging report lists past due amounts according to invoice terms. In addition, we consider historical experience with the customers, the current economic environment, the credit rating of the customers and general overall market conditions. In some countries we maintain credit insurance, which can be used in certain cases of non-payment.\nWe believe that the accounting estimate related to the allowance for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because: (1) it requires management to make assumptions about the ability to collect amounts owed from customers in the future, and (2) changes to these assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on our results of operations. The estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate for all of our segments.\nWhen we determine that a customer is unlikely to pay, we record a charge to bad debt expense in the income statement and an increase to the allowance for doubtful accounts. When it becomes certain the customer cannot pay (typically driven by the customer filing for bankruptcy) we write off the receivable by removing the accounts receivable amount and reducing the allowance for doubtful accounts accordingly. In 2015, we reduced the allowance for doubtful accounts by approximately $813 thousand and we wrote off doubtful accounts of $728 thousand. Please refer to Schedule II-Valuation and Qualifying Accounts for activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts over the past three years.\nWe had approximately $391.6 million in net accounts receivable at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2015, we had approximately $2.7 million recorded in the allowance for doubtful accounts to cover potential future customer non-payments net of any credit insurance reimbursement we would potentially recover. We believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover future non-payments of our customers. However, if economic conditions deteriorate significantly or one of our large customers was to declare bankruptcy, a larger allowance for doubtful accounts might be necessary. It is extremely difficult to estimate how much of an additional reserve would be necessary, but we expect the largest potential customer balance at any one time would not exceed $18.2 million. An additional loss of $18.2 million would reduce our Total Assets as of December 31, 2015 by approximately 0.7% and would have reduced Income Before Income Taxes by approximately 6.2%.\nIf we had been required to recognize an additional $18.2 million in bad debt expense, it would likely not have significantly affected our liquidity and capital resources because, in spite of any such additional expense, we would have been within the terms of our debt covenants.\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n23/ATR\n</td> <td>\n2015 Form 10-K\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nVALUATION OF PENSION BENEFITS\nThe benefit obligations and net periodic pension cost associated with our domestic and foreign noncontributory pension plans are determined using actuarial assumptions. Such assumptions include discount rates to reflect the time value of money, rate of employee compensation increases, demographic assumptions to determine the probability and timing of benefit payments, and the long-term rate of return on plan assets. The actuarial assumptions are based upon management's best estimates, after consulting with outside investment advisors and actuaries. Because assumptions and estimates are used, actual results could differ from expected results.\nThe discount rate is utilized principally in calculating our pension obligations, which are represented by the Accumulated Benefit Obligation (ABO) and the Projected Benefit Obligation (PBO), and in calculating net periodic benefit cost. In establishing the discount rate for our foreign plans, we review a number of relevant interest rates including Aa corporate bond yields. In establishing the discount rate for our domestic plans, we match the hypothetical duration of our plans, using a weighted average duration that is based upon projected cash payments, to a simulated bond portfolio (Citigroup Pension Index Curve). At December 31, 2015, the discount rates for our domestic and foreign plans were 4.24% and 2.10%, respectively.\nWe believe that the accounting estimates related to determining the valuation of pension benefits are critical accounting estimates because: (1) changes in them can materially affect net income, and (2) we are required to establish the discount rate and the expected return on fund assets, which are highly uncertain and require judgment. The estimates for the valuation of pension benefits are critical accounting estimates for all of our segments.\nTo the extent the discount rates increase (or decrease), our PBO and net periodic benefit cost will decrease (or increase) accordingly. The estimated effect of a 1% decrease in each discount rate would be a $49.3 million increase in the PBO ($35.6 million for the domestic plans and $13.7 million for the foreign plans) and a $7.2 million increase in net periodic benefit cost ($6.1 million for the domestic plans and $1.1 million for the foreign plans). To the extent the PBO increases, the after-tax effect of such increase could reduce Other Comprehensive Income and Stockholders' Equity. The estimated effect of a 1% increase in each discount rate would be a $38.2 million decrease in the PBO ($27.3 million for the domestic plans and $10.9 million for the foreign plans) and a $5.6 million decrease in net periodic benefit cost ($4.7 million for the domestic plans and $0.9 million for the foreign plans). A decrease of this magnitude in the PBO would eliminate the current year reduction recognized in Other Comprehensive Income and Stockholders' Equity as related to pension assumptions.\nThe assumed expected long-term rate of return on assets is the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested to provide for the benefits included in the PBO. Of domestic plan assets, approximately 47% was invested in equities, 30% was invested in fixed income securities, 1% was invested in money market funds, 14% was invested in hedge funds and 8% was invested in infrastructure securities at December 31, 2015. Of foreign plan assets, approximately 89% was invested in investment funds, 3% was invested in corporate securities, 1% was invested in fixed income securities, 4% was invested in equity securities and 3% was invested in cash at December 31, 2015.\nThe expected long-term rate of return assumptions are determined based on our investment policy combined with expected risk premiums of equities and fixed income securities over the underlying risk-free rate. This rate is utilized principally in calculating the expected return on the plan assets component of the net periodic benefit cost. To the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the course of a year is greater or less than the assumed rate, that year's net periodic benefit cost is not affected. Rather, this gain (or loss) reduces (or increases) future net periodic benefit cost over a period of approximately 15 to 20 years. To the extent the expected long-term rate of return on assets increases (or decreases), our net periodic benefit cost will decrease (or increase) accordingly. The estimated effect of a 1% decrease (or increase) in each expected long-term rate of return on assets would be a $1.6 million increase (or decrease) in net periodic benefit cost.\nThe average rate of compensation increase is utilized principally in calculating the PBO and the net periodic benefit cost. The estimated effect of a 0.5% decrease in each rate of expected compensation increase would be a $5.8 million decrease in the PBO ($1.5 million for the domestic plans and $4.3 million for the foreign plans) and a $1.1 million decrease to the net periodic benefit cost. The estimated effect of a 0.5% increase in each rate of expected compensation increase would be a $6.2 million increase in the PBO ($1.6 million for the domestic plans and $4.6 million for the foreign plans) and a $1.2 million increase to the net periodic benefit cost.\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n24/ATR\n</td> <td>\n2015 Form 10-K\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOur primary pension related assumptions as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 were as follows:\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nActuarial Assumptions as of December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDiscount rate:\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDomestic plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4.24 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n3.83 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n4.75 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nForeign plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.10 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n1.90 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n3.24 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nExpected long-term rate of return on plan assets:\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDomestic plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7.00 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n7.00 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n7.00 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nForeign plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.66 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n3.54 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n3.79 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRate of compensation increase:\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDomestic plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4.00 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n4.00 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n4.00 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nForeign plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.00 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n3.00 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n3.00 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn order to determine the 2016 net periodic benefit cost, the Company expects to use the discount rates, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets and rates of compensation increase assumptions as of December 31, 2015. The estimated impact of the changes to the assumptions as noted in the table above on our 2016 net periodic benefit cost is expected to be a decrease of approximately $2.8 million.\nSHARE-BASED COMPENSATION\nThe Company uses the Black-Scholes option-valuation model to value stock options, which requires the input of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them ( expected term\u201d), the estimated volatility of the Company's stock price, risk-free interest rate, the expected dividend yield and stock price. The expected term of the options is based on historical experience of similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior. The expected term determines the period for which the risk-free interest rate and volatility must be applied. The risk-free interest rate is based on the expected U.S. Treasury rate over the expected term. Expected stock price volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company's stock price. Dividend yield is management's long-term estimate of annual dividends to be paid as a percentage of share price.\nFor 2015, expense related to share-based compensation for employee stock option plans was $17.9 million. Future changes in the subjective assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-valuation model or estimates associated with forfeitures could impact our share-based compensation expense. For example, a one year reduction in the expected term of the options would decrease the Black-Scholes valuation and reduce share-based compensation by approximately $0.6 million. In comparison, a one year increase in the expected term of the option would increase the Black-Scholes valuation and increase share-based compensation by approximately $0.5 million. In addition, changes in the share price at the date of the grant would impact our share-based compensation expense. For example, a $5 decrease in the stock price would decrease the Black-Scholes valuation and reduce share-based compensation by approximately $0.8 million. In comparison, a $5 increase in the share price would increase the Black-Scholes valuation and increase share-based compensation by approximately $0.8 million.\nOPERATIONS OUTLOOK\nWe don't anticipate significant changes in the various macro challenges that we are facing in the first quarter of 2016. The foreign currency exchange environment is expected to continue to be volatile and will impact our reported results. We will remain flexible to adapt to changing market conditions with a continued focus on containing costs while we invest in innovation and new solutions that will help our customers grow their businesses.\nAptarGroup expects earnings per share for the first quarter, excluding any impacts from costs associated with the Mega Airless acquisition, to be in the range of $0.69 to $0.74 per share compared to $0.70 per share reported in the prior year. Assuming a comparable foreign currency exchange rate environment, comparable earnings per share for the prior year would have been approximately $0.68 per share.\nTable 76: <table> <tr> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n25/ATR\n</td> <td>\n2015 Form 10-K\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nCertain statements in Management's Discussion and Analysis and other sections of this Form 10-K are forward-looking and involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including certain statements set forth in the Liquidity and Capital Resources, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, and Operations Outlook sections of this Form 10-K.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(In thousands, expect per share amounts or otherwise indicated)\nThe objective of the following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Results of Operations and Financial Condition ( MD&A\u201d) is to help the reader understand the financial performance of AptarGroup, Inc. MD&A is presented in eight sections: Overview, Results of Operations, Liquidity and Capital Resources, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Overview of Contractual Obligations, Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements, Critical Accounting Estimates, Operations Outlook and Forward-Looking Statements. MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn MD&A, we,\u201d our,\u201d us,\u201d AptarGroup,\u201d AptarGroup, Inc.\u201d, Aptar\u201d and the Company\u201d refer to AptarGroup, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nOVERVIEW\nGENERAL\nWe are a leading global provider of a broad range of innovative packaging dispensing and sealing solutions primarily for the beauty, personal care, home care, prescription drug, consumer health care, injectables, food and beverage markets. Our creative packaging solutions enhance the convenience, safety and security of consumers around the globe and allow our customers to differentiate their products in the market.\nWe define core sales as net sales excluding acquisitions and changes in foreign currency rates. Core sales is a non-GAAP financial measure. We present this measure as supplemental information to help our investors better understand the trends in our business results over time. Our management uses core sales to evaluate our business on a consistent basis. A reconciliation of core sales growth to net sales growth, the most comparable GAAP measure, can be found on page 15.\n2015 was a challenging year with sluggish macroeconomic conditions, foreign currency translation headwinds and specific softness in several key markets. In spite of these issues, we grew the top line on a core sales basis, adapted to the softer market conditions with a Company-wide focus on cost containment and benefitted from lower input costs. As a result, we were able to improve margins and grow operating income by 6%. We also executed our balanced capital allocation strategy by deploying capital to fund internal growth projects and increasing our dividend. Just after year-end, we also announced our agreement to acquire a leading provider of all-plastic airless dispensing systems for the beauty, personal care and pharmaceutical markets.\n2015 HIGHLIGHTS\n \u00b7 We achieved record annual net income and earnings per share. \n \u00b7 Core sales increased 1%, while reported sales decreased 11% largely due to changes in foreign currency translation rates. \n \u00b7 Performance of our Pharma and Food + Beverage segments offset certain softness in our Beauty + Home segment. \n \u00b7 Lower material costs, cost savings initiatives and productivity improvements drove margin improvements across all three segments. \n \u00b7 We paid increased annual dividends for the 22nd consecutive year (current annualized dividend is $1.20 per share). \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table sets forth the consolidated statements of income and the related percentages of net sales for the periods indicated:\n\nNET SALES\nWe reported net sales of $2.3 billion for 2015, 11% below 2014 reported net sales of $2.6 billion. The average U.S. dollar exchange rate strengthened significantly relative to the Euro and also strengthened relative to other currencies impacting our business, resulting in a negative currency translation impact of 12%. Therefore, sales excluding changes in foreign currency rates ( core sales\u201d) increased by 1% in 2015 compared to 2014. Core sales growth in the Pharma and Food + Beverage segments was substantially offset by a decline in core sales in the Beauty + Home segment.\nIn 2014, we reported net sales of $2.6 billion, 3% above 2013 reported net sales of $2.5 billion. The negative translation effect of 2% mainly relates to the strength of the U.S. Dollar compared to Latin American and Asian currencies as the Euro rates remained relatively stable when compared to the U.S. Dollar for the full year. All three operating segments saw core sales increases in 2014, but the consolidated 5% core sales growth was mainly driven by the strong results of our Food + Beverage and Pharma segments.\n\nForeign currency effects are approximations of the adjustment necessary to state the prior year net sales using current period exchange rates. For further discussion on net sales by reporting segment, please refer to the segment analysis of net sales and operating income on the following pages.\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, net sales by geographic location:\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nCOST OF SALES (EXCLUSIVE OF DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION SHOWN BELOW)\nOur cost of sales as a percent of net sales decreased to 64.8% in 2015 compared to 67.6% in 2014. The decrease is partly due to a one-time favorable $7.4 million change in our inventory accounting principle for the inventory valuation method of certain operating entities in our North American business to the first-in first-out (FIFO) method from the last-in first-out (LIFO) method which was recorded in the second quarter of 2015. Operationally, we benefitted from our mix of products sold. Our Pharma segment sales represented a higher percentage of our overall sales in 2015 compared to 2014. This positively impacts our cost of sales percentage as margins on our pharmaceutical products typically are higher than the overall Company average. We also benefitted from lower material costs, cost savings initiatives and productivity improvements along with a positive impact from the timing delay of resin pass-throughs of approximately $8.9 million as resin prices declined significantly during 2015.\nIn 2014, our cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased to 67.6% compared to 67.8% in 2013. Positively impacting the cost of sales percentage in 2014 were the mix of products sold as the Pharma segment sales represented a higher percentage of our overall sales in 2014 compared to 2013, along with incremental cost savings from a restructuring plan to optimize certain production capacities in Europe which was fully realized in 2014. These savings were partially offset by underutilized U.S. overhead as soft demand in certain product lines negatively impacted our North American cost of sales, mainly in our Beauty + Home segment. We also incurred additional costs in Latin America as we recognized approximately $3.0 million in one-time costs related to the start-up of our Colombian operations and incurred $1.3 million of expenses related to a fire that occurred in one of our Brazilian facilities.\nSELLING, RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT AND ADMINISTRATIVE\nOur Selling, Research & Development and Administrative expenses ( SG&A\u201d) decreased approximately 8% or $32.4 million in 2015 compared to the same period a year ago. Excluding changes in foreign currency rates, SG&A increased by approximately $11.6 million compared to the same period a year ago. Cost savings initiatives were offset by higher professional fees related to our ongoing information systems implementations and approximately $1.9 million of transaction costs related to an agreement to acquire Mega Airless which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2016. We also realized higher pension costs related to lower discount rates along with other normal inflationary increases. For 2015, SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased to 15.2% compared to 14.8% of net sales in the same period of the prior year.\nIn 2014, our SG&A expenses increased approximately 5% or $19.2 million compared to the same period a year ago. Excluding changes in foreign currency rates, SG&A increased approximately $24.2 million compared to the same period a year earlier. The increase was due to several factors, including higher research and development costs mainly related to our bonded aluminum to plastic technology. We also realized higher information technology costs associated with our ongoing enterprise resource planning system roll-ins along with higher stock compensation expense. For 2014, SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased to 14.8% compared to 14.4% of net sales in the same period of the prior year.\nDEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased approximately 9% or $13.3 million in 2015. Excluding changes in foreign currency rates, depreciation and amortization increased by approximately $4.4 million compared to the same period a year ago. This increase is mainly due to our investments in new products and our global enterprise resource planning system. Depreciation and amortization as a percentage of net sales increased to 6.0% compared to 5.8% for the same period a year ago.\nIn 2014, depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately 2% or $2.3 million. Excluding changes in foreign currency rates, depreciation and amortization increased by approximately $3.6 million compared to the same period a year earlier. The investments in our new products and the continued roll-out of our global enterprise resource planning system mentioned above exceeded exceptional charges incurred in 2013. Depreciation and amortization as a percentage of net sales decreased slightly to 5.8% compared to 6.0% in 2013.\nRESTRUCTURING INITIATIVES\nOn November 1, 2012, the Company announced a plan to optimize certain capacity in Europe. Due to increased production efficiencies and to better position the Company for future growth in Europe, AptarGroup transferred and consolidated production capacity involving twelve facilities. Under the plan, two facilities closed which impacted approximately 170 employees. During 2013, we recognized $11.8 million of restructuring expenses along with $2.7 million accelerated depreciation of assets. The plan was substantially completed at the end of 2013 with total costs of approximately $19.5 million.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOPERATING INCOME\nOperating income increased approximately $17.7 million or 6% to $324.1 million in 2015. Excluding changes in currency rates, operating income increased by approximately $57.6 million in 2015. We benefitted from the $7.4 million change in inventory accounting principle along with the strong results of our Pharma and Food + Beverage segments. We also benefitted from a positive impact from the timing delay in passing through resin cost decreases and certain cost saving initiatives driven by the segments, which were slightly offset by transaction costs related to an agreement to acquire Mega Airless. Reported operating income as a percentage of net sales increased to 14.0% in 2015 compared to 11.8% for the same period in the prior year due to the same factors mentioned above.\nIn 2014, operating income increased approximately $21.8 million or 8% to $306.4 million. Excluding changes in currency rates, operating income increased by approximately $22.7 million in 2014. 2013 results included the negative impact of the European restructuring plan charges of $11.8 million. The remaining $10.9 million increase in operating income over the prior year is due to additional operating income from our sales growth, primarily from the Pharma and Food + Beverage segments. Reported operating income as a percentage of net sales increased to 11.8% in 2014 compared to 11.3% for the same period in the prior year due to the costs associated with our European restructuring plan in 2013.\nNET OTHER EXPENSES\nNet other expenses in 2015 increased to $29.6 million compared to $20.1 million in 2014. During 2015, we incurred $13.6 million of higher interest expense related to our additional $475 million senior notes established late 2014 and early 2015 along with increased costs of our forward exchange contracts. These increases were offset by $2.9 million of gain due to an insurance recovery on the involuntary conversion of fixed assets related to a fire in one of our Brazilian facilities. In addition, 2014 net other expenses included a $1.5 million write-down on a non-controlling investment.\nIn 2014, net other expenses decreased slightly to $20.1 million compared to $20.2 million in 2013. Higher interest income and lower hedging costs were mostly offset by the recognition of a $1.5 million write-down on a non-controlling investment taken during the first quarter of 2014 to align with the current fair value.\nEFFECTIVE TAX RATE\nThe reported effective tax rate on net income for 2015 and 2014 was 32.3% and 33.1%, respectively. The lower tax rate for 2015 is attributable to the reduction of valuation allowances related to U.S. state tax credits and tax benefits associated with exceptional depreciation provisions enacted in France during 2015.\nThe reported effective tax rate on net income for 2014 and 2013 was 33.1% and 35.0%, respectively. The Company did not repatriate any earnings from foreign jurisdictions to the U.S. in 2014 and this reduced our reported effective tax rate compared to 2013.\nNET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO APTARGROUP, INC.\nWe reported net income of $199.3 million compared to $191.7 million reported in 2014 and $172.0 million reported in 2013.\nBEAUTY + HOME SEGMENT\n\n (1) Segment income is defined as earnings before net interest expense, certain corporate expenses, restructuring initiatives and income taxes. The Company evaluates performance of its business units and allocates resources based upon segment income. For a reconciliation of segment income to income before income taxes, see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. \nNet sales decreased approximately 15% in 2015 to $1.27 billion compared to $1.50 billion in 2014. Changes in foreign currency negatively impacted reported sales for 2015 by 13%. Core sales, which exclude changes in exchange rates, decreased 2% in 2015 compared to the prior year. Core sales to the personal care, beauty and home care markets decreased by 5%, 1% and 2%, respectively, in 2015 compared to 2014. We experienced global market softness in all regions except Asia leading to a sales decline on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. Decreases in selling prices due to contractual resin cost pass-throughs to our customers negatively impacted sales by $9.1 million. Customer tooling sales, excluding foreign currency changes, increased $8.0 million in 2015 to $36.9 million compared to $28.9 million in the prior year.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIn 2014, net sales increased approximately 1% to $1.50 billion compared to $1.49 billion in 2013. Changes in foreign currency negatively impacted reported sales for 2014 by 2%. Core sales, which exclude changes in exchange rates, increased 3% in 2014 compared to the prior year. Core sales to the beauty market increased approximately 4% while core sales to the personal care and home care markets increased approximately 3% and 4%, respectively, in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase in beauty sales was primarily due to growth of our prestige fragrance and skin care products. Personal care increased over the prior year due to stronger sales to our personal cleansing and sun care customers while sales to the home care market increased mainly due to improved laundry care sales. Geographically, all four regions reported increases in net sales with strong core sales growth in our emerging markets along with moderate growth in Europe and the U.S. Customer tooling sales, excluding foreign currency changes, decreased in 2014 to $33.9 million compared to $37.7 million in the prior year.\nIn spite of the decrease in net sales, segment income for 2015 increased slightly to $98.7 million from $98.4 million reported in 2014. The negative impacts of foreign currency rate changes and lower product sales were more than offset by lower material costs, cost savings initiatives and improved productivity, mainly in North America. We recognized a $2.4 million negative transaction effect related to the importing of components into Latin America from different regions due to the continued devaluation of certain Latin American currencies. However, this was offset by a $5.1 million favorable impact from the timing of resin pass-throughs in 2015 primarily in North America.\nIn 2014, segment income decreased approximately 10% to $98.4 million from $109.3 million reported in 2013. Soft demand in certain product lines negatively impacted our North American region. We also recognized approximately $3.0 million in one-time costs related to the start-up of our Colombian operations. Due to the significant devaluation of certain Latin American currencies, we recognized approximately $3.3 million of negative transaction effects related to the importing of components from different regions. In addition, we incurred $1.3 million of expense related to a fire that occurred in one of our Brazilian facilities.\nPHARMA SEGMENT\n\nNet sales decreased approximately 5% in 2015 to $712.2 million compared to $751.2 million in 2014. Foreign currency changes negatively impacted total segment sales by 13%. Core sales, which exclude changes in exchange rates, increased 8% in 2015 compared to the prior year. Core sales to the prescription and injectables markets increased 13% and 7%, respectively, in 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year. Prescription growth was led by strong demand for allergy products in both over the counter and prescription versions in the U.S. market as well as generics in Europe. We also experienced strong demand for our Asthma/COPD metered dose inhaler aerosol valves from key branded and generics customers worldwide. Injectables grew on increased stopper and syringe component sales with strong demand in Europe, U.S., India and Latin America. Core sales to the consumer health care market were down slightly to the prior year as growth in our non-prescription nasal decongestant business was offset by the softness in Eastern Europe and customer inventory reduction plans. Customer tooling sales, excluding foreign currency changes, increased $6.0 million in 2015 to $20.3 million compared to $14.3 million in the prior year.\nIn 2014, net sales increased approximately 6% to $751.2 million compared to $708.8 million in 2013. Foreign currency changes negatively impacted total segment sales by 1%. Core sales, which exclude changes in exchange rates, increased 7% in 2014 compared to the prior year. Core sales of our products increased in each end market and geographic region we serve. Core sales to the prescription drug market increased 6% on strong demand for our metered dose inhaler valves for various asthma and COPD treatments, including new generic launches in developing regions. We continued to see strong demand for our consumer health care products, which increased 12% partially due to preservative free eye care launches in Europe using our innovative ophthalmic squeeze dispenser along with strong sales of our products used for nasal decongestant. Excluding foreign currency rate changes, sales to the injectables market increased 1%. Customer tooling sales, excluding foreign currency changes, decreased in 2014 to $16.9 million compared to $21.1 million in the prior year.\nSegment income increased approximately 3% to $210.5 million in 2015 compared to $204.7 million in 2014. This increase is mainly attributed to the higher sales volumes and improved product mix within the segment as well as cost containment initiatives. Prior year results also included a $1.5 million write-down on a non-controlling investment to align with the current fair value.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIn 2014, segment income increased approximately 8% to $204.7 million compared to $189.7 million in 2013. This increase is mainly attributed to higher sales for the prescription and consumer health care markets discussed above. The Pharma segment also recognized a $1.5 million expense in the first quarter of 2014 related to the write-down of a non-controlling investment to fair value.\nFOOD + BEVERAGE SEGMENT\n\nNet sales decreased by approximately 5% in 2015 to $332.0 million compared to $348.3 million in 2014. Excluding changes in foreign currency rates, sales increased 2%. Decreases in prices due to resin pass-throughs to our customers negatively impacted sales by $6.6 million while customer tooling sales, excluding foreign currency changes, decreased $11.5 million in 2015 to $15.6 million compared to $27.1 million in the prior year. Sales of our products, excluding foreign currency changes, to the food market increased 3% and core sales of our products to the beverage market increased approximately 1% in 2015 compared to the prior year. Broad based growth in the food market was partially offset by lower tooling sales of $10.9 million in 2015 compared to 2014. Beverage sales increased slightly as higher bottled water sales offset weakness in the functional drink and concentrated beverage flavorings applications.\nIn 2014, net sales increased by approximately 8% to $348.3 million compared to $323.1 million in 2013. Excluding changes in foreign currency rates, sales increased 9%. Sales of our products, excluding foreign currency changes, to the food market increased 7% and core sales of our products to the beverage market increased approximately 11% in 2014 compared to the prior year. The food sales increase was mainly due to improved sales of our products used to dispense sauces/condiments and dairy creamers. The beverage sales increase was driven by the continued success of our products used on functional beverages in the Asian region as well as growth in the concentrate beverage flavoring market in Europe. Customer tooling sales, excluding foreign currency changes, also increased in 2014 to $28.5 million compared to $27.2 million in the prior year.\nSegment income increased approximately 13% to $42.7 million in 2015 compared to $37.7 million in 2014. This increase is mainly attributed to higher product sales volumes, improved operational performance and a $3.8 million favorable impact due to the timing of resin pass-throughs.\nIn 2014, segment income increased approximately 7% to $37.7 million compared to $35.2 million in 2013. This increase is mainly driven by the increase in product sales to both the food and beverage markets.\nCORPORATE & OTHER\nCertain costs that are not allocated to our three operating business segments are classified as Corporate & Other,\u201d which is presented separately in Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Corporate & Other primarily includes certain corporate compensation, professional fees, certain information system costs and LIFO inventory adjustments (prior to our accounting change in the second quarter of 2015).\nCorporate & Other expense in 2015 decreased to $28.4 million compared to $38.3 million in 2014. This decrease is primarily due to the favorable impact of a $7.4 million change in accounting principle related to our inventory valuation method during the second quarter, $2.9 million of gain due to an insurance recovery on the involuntary conversion of fixed assets related to a fire in one of our Brazilian facilities along with the positive effect of changes in exchange rates on the translation of foreign based costs. These decreases were partially offset by $1.9 million of transaction costs related to an agreement to acquire Mega Airless.\nIn 2014, Corporate & Other expense increased slightly to $38.3 million compared to $38.0 million in 2013. The increase was mainly due to increases in professional fees associated with our legal entity reorganization project in 2014. The 2013 Corporate & Other expense included a $1.5 million adjustment for accelerated depreciation recognized on certain corporate assets in 2013.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash flows provided by our operations and our revolving credit facility. In 2015, our operations provided cash flows that totaled $324.5 million compared to $316.3 million in 2014 and $286.1 million in 2013. The increase in cash flow from operations in 2015 is mainly due to profit growth resulting from operational improvements, cost containment efforts and lower input costs. Comparing 2014 to 2013, the increase is mainly due to lower cash used for working capital compared to the prior year.\nWe used $176.2 million in cash for investing activities during 2015, compared to $159.2 million during 2014 and $157.1 million during 2013. The increase in cash used for investing activities is due to the purchase of $32.8 million in short term investments. Short term investments reflect funds invested in a time deposit instrument with a two-year maturity. However, during the life of the investment the funds can be redeemed at any time with a 35-90 day notice. There are no penalties for early redemption. This increase in cash used for short term investments was partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures of $12.6 million. Comparing 2014 to 2013, the increase in cash used for investing activities is primarily related to the increase in capital expenditures of approximately $10.4 million during the year. We estimate that we will spend approximately $160 million (assuming current exchange rates) on capital expenditures in 2016.\nOur net cash used for financing activities in 2015 was $33.1 million compared to $20.7 million in 2014 and $67.8 million in 2013. During the fourth quarter 2015, we repurchased $13.9 million shares for retirement. Comparing 2014 to 2013, the decrease in cash used for financing activities was primarily due to an increase in our proceeds from long-term debt which was primarily used to fund share repurchases through our accelerated share repurchase program.\nCash and equivalents increased $90.1 million to $489.9 million at the end of 2015 from $399.8 million at the end of 2014. Total short and long-term interest bearing debt decreased to $819.5 million at the end of 2015 from $840.9 million at the end of 2014. The ratio of our Net Debt (interest bearing debt less cash and cash equivalents) to Net Capital (Stockholders' Equity plus Net Debt) decreased to 20.7% at the end of 2015 compared to 28.6% as of December 31, 2014.\nThe Company maintains a revolving credit facility that provides for unsecured financing of up to $300 million. Each borrowing under this credit facility will bear interest at rates based on LIBOR, prime rates or other similar rates, in each case plus an applicable margin. A facility fee on the total amount of the facility is also payable quarterly, regardless of usage. The applicable margins for borrowings under the credit facility and the facility fee percentage may change from time to time depending on changes in AptarGroup's consolidated leverage ratio. The facility matures on December 16, 2019. At December 31, 2015, there was no outstanding balance under the credit facility. The outstanding balance under the credit facility was $230 million at December 31, 2014 and is reported as notes payable in the current liabilities section of the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. We incurred approximately $0.9 million and $2.7 million in interest and fees related to this credit facility during 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nOur revolving credit facility and certain long-term obligations require us to satisfy certain financial and other covenants including:\n\n (a) Definitions of ratios are included as part of the revolving credit facility agreement. \nBased upon the above consolidated leverage ratio covenant, we would have the ability to borrow approximately an additional $1.7 billion before the 3.50 to 1.00 ratio requirement would be exceeded.\nOur foreign operations have historically met cash requirements with the use of internally generated cash or borrowings. These foreign subsidiaries have financing arrangements with several foreign banks to fund operations located outside the U.S., but the majority of these arrangements are uncommitted. Cash generated by foreign operations has generally been reinvested locally. The majority of our $489.9 million in cash and equivalents is located outside of the U.S. We manage our global cash requirements considering (i) available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct business, (ii) the geographic location of our liquidity needs, and (iii) the cost to access international cash balances. The repatriation of non-U.S. cash balances from certain subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences as we may be required to pay income tax on those funds. Historically, the tax consequences associated with repatriating current year earnings to the U.S. has been between 10% and 14% of the repatriated amount. We do not expect future impacts to be materially different.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe believe we are in a strong financial position and have the financial resources to meet our business requirements in the foreseeable future. We have historically used cash flow from operations as our primary source of liquidity. Our primary uses of liquidity are to invest in equipment and facilities that are necessary to support our growth and to make acquisitions that will contribute to the achievement of our strategic objectives. We currently anticipate funding the Mega Airless acquisition using available cash on hand in Europe and an existing revolving line of credit in the U.S. Other uses of liquidity include paying dividends to shareholders and repurchasing shares of our common stock. In the event that customer demand would decrease significantly for a prolonged period of time and negatively impact cash flow from operations, we would have the ability to restrict and significantly reduce capital expenditure levels, as well as evaluate our acquisition strategy and dividend and share repurchase programs. A prolonged and significant reduction in capital expenditure levels could increase future repairs and maintenance costs as well as have a negative impact on operating margins if we were unable to invest in new innovative products.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nWe lease certain warehouse, plant and office facilities as well as certain equipment under noncancelable operating leases expiring at various dates through the year 2027. Most of the operating leases contain renewal options and certain equipment leases include options to purchase during or at the end of the lease term. Other than operating lease obligations, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. See the following section Overview of Contractual Obligations\u201d for future payments relating to operating leases.\nOVERVIEW OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nBelow is a table of our outstanding contractual obligations and future payments as of December 31, 2015:\n\n (1) The future payments listed above for capital lease obligations and long-term debt repayments reflect only principal payments. \n (2) Notes payable mainly includes local, non-U.S. short-term borrowings. The future payments listed above assume that no additional amounts will be drawn under this credit facility. \n (3) Purchase obligations are agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transactions. \n (4) Approximately 0.2% of our total interest bearing long-term debt has variable interest rates. Using our long-term variable rate debt outstanding as of December 31, 2015 of approximately $1.2 million at an average rate of approximately 7.6%, we included approximately $0.1 million of variable interest rate obligations in 2015. No variable interest rate obligations were included in subsequent years. \n (5) This line represents the required minimum pension contribution obligation for the Company's U.S. plans. At this time, the Company is not required to make a contribution. The Company also makes contributions to its foreign pension plans but amounts are expected to be discretionary in 2016 and future years. Therefore amounts related to these plans are not included in the preceding table. \n (6) This line represents the current portion of the liability for uncertain tax positions. Aside from deferred income taxes, we have approximately $94.1 million of other deferred long-term liabilities on the balance sheet, which consist primarily of retirement plan obligations as described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the long-term payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time. Therefore, the long-term portion of the liability is excluded from the preceding table. \nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nWe have reviewed the recently issued accounting standards updates to the Financial Accounting Standards Board's ( FASB's\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification that have future effective dates. Standards which are effective for 2015 are discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIn May 2014, the FASB amended the guidance for recognition of revenue from customer contracts. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in the amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB decided to defer the effective date by one year to December 15, 2017 for annual reporting periods beginning after that date. The FASB also decided to allow early adoption of the standard, but not before the original effective date of December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued an Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) intended to simplify GAAP by changing the presentation of debt issuance costs. Under the new standard, debt issuance costs will be presented as a reduction of the carrying amount of the related liability, rather than as an asset. The new treatment is consistent with debt discounts. In August 2015, the FASB issued an ASU clarifying that debt issuance costs related to line of credit arrangements can be classified as an asset and amortized ratably over the term of the line of credit arrangement. These standards are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, but early adoption is permitted. The Company does not believe that this new guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued new guidance on a customer's accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement (CCA). Previously, there was no specific GAAP guidance on accounting for such fees from the customer's perspective. Under the new standard, customers will apply the same criteria as vendors to determine whether a CCA contains a software license or is solely a service contract. This standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, but early adoption is permitted. The Company does not believe that this new guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued new guidance for simplifying the measurement of inventory. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company does not believe that this new guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued guidance simplifies the balance sheet classification of deferred taxes. The new guidance requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be presented as non-current in a classified statement of financial position. This standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Other than presentation, the Company does not believe that this new guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nOther accounting standards that have been issued by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We continually evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, intangible assets, income taxes, pensions and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on a variety of other assumptions believed to be reasonable in order to make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our Board of Directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to it in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Results of Operations and Financial Condition.\nIMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL\nIn accordance with current accounting standards, goodwill has an indefinite life and is not amortized. We evaluate our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis, or whenever indicators of impairment exist. We have determined that our business segments represent our reporting units except for Injectables which, based on our review, qualifies as a separate reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing. As of December 31, 2015, we have $310.2 million of goodwill, which is allocated as follows: $33.7 million is allocated to the Pharma reporting unit, $95.6 million is allocated to the Injectables reporting unit, $164.6 million is allocated to the Beauty + Home reporting unit and $16.3 million is allocated to the Food + Beverage reporting unit.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe believe that the accounting estimate related to determining the fair value of our reporting units is a critical accounting estimate because: (1) it is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires Company management to make assumptions about the future cash flows for each reporting unit over several years in the future, and (2) the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported on our balance sheet as well as our results of operations could be material. Management's assumptions about future cash flows for the reporting units require significant judgment and actual cash flows in the future may differ significantly from those forecasted today. The estimate for future cash flows and its impact on the impairment testing of goodwill is a critical accounting estimate for all the segments of our business.\nFor our goodwill impairment assessment we have adopted a standard that provides an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not (greater than 50 percent chance) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Such qualitative factors may include the following: macroeconomic conditions; industry and market considerations; cost factors; overall financial performance; and other relevant entity-specific events. In the absence of sufficient qualitative factors, goodwill impairment is determined utilizing a two-step process. If it is determined that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount, where necessary, goodwill will be impaired at that time.\nWe performed our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31, 2015 for each of our reporting units. Based on our qualitative assessment of macroeconomic, industry, and market events and circumstances as well as the overall financial performance of the reporting units, we determined it was more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill attributed to these reporting units was greater than its carrying amount. As such, the annual two-step impairment test was deemed not necessary to be performed for our reporting units for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS\nWe record an allowance for doubtful accounts as an estimate of the inability of our customers to make their required payments. We determine the amount of our allowance for doubtful accounts by looking at a variety of factors. First, we examine an aging report of the accounts receivable in each entity within the Company. The aging report lists past due amounts according to invoice terms. In addition, we consider historical experience with the customers, the current economic environment, the credit rating of the customers and general overall market conditions. In some countries we maintain credit insurance, which can be used in certain cases of non-payment.\nWe believe that the accounting estimate related to the allowance for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because: (1) it requires management to make assumptions about the ability to collect amounts owed from customers in the future, and (2) changes to these assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on our results of operations. The estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate for all of our segments.\nWhen we determine that a customer is unlikely to pay, we record a charge to bad debt expense in the income statement and an increase to the allowance for doubtful accounts. When it becomes certain the customer cannot pay (typically driven by the customer filing for bankruptcy) we write off the receivable by removing the accounts receivable amount and reducing the allowance for doubtful accounts accordingly. In 2015, we reduced the allowance for doubtful accounts by approximately $813 thousand and we wrote off doubtful accounts of $728 thousand. Please refer to Schedule II-Valuation and Qualifying Accounts for activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts over the past three years.\nWe had approximately $391.6 million in net accounts receivable at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2015, we had approximately $2.7 million recorded in the allowance for doubtful accounts to cover potential future customer non-payments net of any credit insurance reimbursement we would potentially recover. We believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover future non-payments of our customers. However, if economic conditions deteriorate significantly or one of our large customers was to declare bankruptcy, a larger allowance for doubtful accounts might be necessary. It is extremely difficult to estimate how much of an additional reserve would be necessary, but we expect the largest potential customer balance at any one time would not exceed $18.2 million. An additional loss of $18.2 million would reduce our Total Assets as of December 31, 2015 by approximately 0.7% and would have reduced Income Before Income Taxes by approximately 6.2%.\nIf we had been required to recognize an additional $18.2 million in bad debt expense, it would likely not have significantly affected our liquidity and capital resources because, in spite of any such additional expense, we would have been within the terms of our debt covenants.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nVALUATION OF PENSION BENEFITS\nThe benefit obligations and net periodic pension cost associated with our domestic and foreign noncontributory pension plans are determined using actuarial assumptions. Such assumptions include discount rates to reflect the time value of money, rate of employee compensation increases, demographic assumptions to determine the probability and timing of benefit payments, and the long-term rate of return on plan assets. The actuarial assumptions are based upon management's best estimates, after consulting with outside investment advisors and actuaries. Because assumptions and estimates are used, actual results could differ from expected results.\nThe discount rate is utilized principally in calculating our pension obligations, which are represented by the Accumulated Benefit Obligation (ABO) and the Projected Benefit Obligation (PBO), and in calculating net periodic benefit cost. In establishing the discount rate for our foreign plans, we review a number of relevant interest rates including Aa corporate bond yields. In establishing the discount rate for our domestic plans, we match the hypothetical duration of our plans, using a weighted average duration that is based upon projected cash payments, to a simulated bond portfolio (Citigroup Pension Index Curve). At December 31, 2015, the discount rates for our domestic and foreign plans were 4.24% and 2.10%, respectively.\nWe believe that the accounting estimates related to determining the valuation of pension benefits are critical accounting estimates because: (1) changes in them can materially affect net income, and (2) we are required to establish the discount rate and the expected return on fund assets, which are highly uncertain and require judgment. The estimates for the valuation of pension benefits are critical accounting estimates for all of our segments.\nTo the extent the discount rates increase (or decrease), our PBO and net periodic benefit cost will decrease (or increase) accordingly. The estimated effect of a 1% decrease in each discount rate would be a $49.3 million increase in the PBO ($35.6 million for the domestic plans and $13.7 million for the foreign plans) and a $7.2 million increase in net periodic benefit cost ($6.1 million for the domestic plans and $1.1 million for the foreign plans). To the extent the PBO increases, the after-tax effect of such increase could reduce Other Comprehensive Income and Stockholders' Equity. The estimated effect of a 1% increase in each discount rate would be a $38.2 million decrease in the PBO ($27.3 million for the domestic plans and $10.9 million for the foreign plans) and a $5.6 million decrease in net periodic benefit cost ($4.7 million for the domestic plans and $0.9 million for the foreign plans). A decrease of this magnitude in the PBO would eliminate the current year reduction recognized in Other Comprehensive Income and Stockholders' Equity as related to pension assumptions.\nThe assumed expected long-term rate of return on assets is the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested to provide for the benefits included in the PBO. Of domestic plan assets, approximately 47% was invested in equities, 30% was invested in fixed income securities, 1% was invested in money market funds, 14% was invested in hedge funds and 8% was invested in infrastructure securities at December 31, 2015. Of foreign plan assets, approximately 89% was invested in investment funds, 3% was invested in corporate securities, 1% was invested in fixed income securities, 4% was invested in equity securities and 3% was invested in cash at December 31, 2015.\nThe expected long-term rate of return assumptions are determined based on our investment policy combined with expected risk premiums of equities and fixed income securities over the underlying risk-free rate. This rate is utilized principally in calculating the expected return on the plan assets component of the net periodic benefit cost. To the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the course of a year is greater or less than the assumed rate, that year's net periodic benefit cost is not affected. Rather, this gain (or loss) reduces (or increases) future net periodic benefit cost over a period of approximately 15 to 20 years. To the extent the expected long-term rate of return on assets increases (or decreases), our net periodic benefit cost will decrease (or increase) accordingly. The estimated effect of a 1% decrease (or increase) in each expected long-term rate of return on assets would be a $1.6 million increase (or decrease) in net periodic benefit cost.\nThe average rate of compensation increase is utilized principally in calculating the PBO and the net periodic benefit cost. The estimated effect of a 0.5% decrease in each rate of expected compensation increase would be a $5.8 million decrease in the PBO ($1.5 million for the domestic plans and $4.3 million for the foreign plans) and a $1.1 million decrease to the net periodic benefit cost. The estimated effect of a 0.5% increase in each rate of expected compensation increase would be a $6.2 million increase in the PBO ($1.6 million for the domestic plans and $4.6 million for the foreign plans) and a $1.2 million increase to the net periodic benefit cost.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOur primary pension related assumptions as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 were as follows:\n\nIn order to determine the 2016 net periodic benefit cost, the Company expects to use the discount rates, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets and rates of compensation increase assumptions as of December 31, 2015. The estimated impact of the changes to the assumptions as noted in the table above on our 2016 net periodic benefit cost is expected to be a decrease of approximately $2.8 million.\nSHARE-BASED COMPENSATION\nThe Company uses the Black-Scholes option-valuation model to value stock options, which requires the input of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them ( expected term\u201d), the estimated volatility of the Company's stock price, risk-free interest rate, the expected dividend yield and stock price. The expected term of the options is based on historical experience of similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior. The expected term determines the period for which the risk-free interest rate and volatility must be applied. The risk-free interest rate is based on the expected U.S. Treasury rate over the expected term. Expected stock price volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company's stock price. Dividend yield is management's long-term estimate of annual dividends to be paid as a percentage of share price.\nFor 2015, expense related to share-based compensation for employee stock option plans was $17.9 million. Future changes in the subjective assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-valuation model or estimates associated with forfeitures could impact our share-based compensation expense. For example, a one year reduction in the expected term of the options would decrease the Black-Scholes valuation and reduce share-based compensation by approximately $0.6 million. In comparison, a one year increase in the expected term of the option would increase the Black-Scholes valuation and increase share-based compensation by approximately $0.5 million. In addition, changes in the share price at the date of the grant would impact our share-based compensation expense. For example, a $5 decrease in the stock price would decrease the Black-Scholes valuation and reduce share-based compensation by approximately $0.8 million. In comparison, a $5 increase in the share price would increase the Black-Scholes valuation and increase share-based compensation by approximately $0.8 million.\nOPERATIONS OUTLOOK\nWe don't anticipate significant changes in the various macro challenges that we are facing in the first quarter of 2016. The foreign currency exchange environment is expected to continue to be volatile and will impact our reported results. We will remain flexible to adapt to changing market conditions with a continued focus on containing costs while we invest in innovation and new solutions that will help our customers grow their businesses.\nAptarGroup expects earnings per share for the first quarter, excluding any impacts from costs associated with the Mega Airless acquisition, to be in the range of $0.69 to $0.74 per share compared to $0.70 per share reported in the prior year. Assuming a comparable foreign currency exchange rate environment, comparable earnings per share for the prior year would have been approximately $0.68 per share.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nCertain statements in Management's Discussion and Analysis and other sections of this Form 10-K are forward-looking and involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including certain statements set forth in the Liquidity and Capital Resources, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, and Operations Outlook sections of this Form 10-K.

Report on Form 10-K provides a detailed explanation of the company's financial performance, its strategy, and outlook. The MD&A consists of eight sections which include an overview, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources, off-balance sheet arrangements, contractual obligations, recently issued accounting pronouncements, critical accounting estimates, an operations outlook, and forward-looking statements. \n\nKey points from the report include:\n\n- AptarGroup is a global leader in packaging dispensing and sealing solutions, serving various markets like beauty, personal care, food, and beverage.\n- The company presents core sales, a non-GAAP measure that excludes the effects of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, to provide a clearer view of underlying sales trends.\n- Despite challenging conditions in 2015, such as a sluggish economy and foreign currency headwinds, they managed growth in core sales and improved operating income by 6%.\n- Record annual net income and earnings per share were achieved.\n- Net sales for 2015 were $2.3 billion, down by 11% from the reported sales in 2014, primarily due to foreign currency translation rates. Core sales increased 1% in the same period.\n- Pharma and Food + Beverage segments showed strong performance, which partially offset the softness in the Beauty + Home segment.\n- Various costs were contained and material costs were lower, leading to improving margins.\n- Entering 2016, they expect to confront similar macroeconomic challenges, foreign currency volatility, and a forecasted earnings per share range of $0.69 to $0.74 for the first quarter, compared to $0.70 per share in the prior year.\n\nThe company is well-positioned in terms of liquidity and capital resources, with the primary source being cash flows from operations and a revolving credit facility. They plan to invest approximately $160 million in capital expenditures in 2016. AptarGroup is confident in their financial foundation and anticipates growth and continued investment in innovation. There are risks involved, such as economic conditions, industry competition, regulatory changes, and possible work stoppages due to labor disputes. Lastly, all forward-looking statements in the report are based on management's assumptions and are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations."}
