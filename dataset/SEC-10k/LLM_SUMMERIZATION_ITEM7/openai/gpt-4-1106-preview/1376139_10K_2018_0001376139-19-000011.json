The cost to acquire crude oil and other feedstocks and the price for which refined products are ultimately sold depend on factors beyond the petroleum segment's control, including the supply of and demand for crude oil, as well as, gasoline and other refined products which, in turn, depend on, among other factors, changes in domestic and foreign economies, weather conditions, domestic and foreign political affairs, production levels, the availability of imports, the marketing of competitive fuels and the extent of government regulation. Because the petroleum segment applies first-in first-out accounting to value its inventory, crude oil price movements may impact net income in the short term because of changes in the value of its unhedged inventory. The effect of changes in crude oil prices on the petroleum segment results of operations is partially influenced by the rate at which the process of refined products adjust to reflect these changes.\nThe prices of crude oil and other feedstocks and refined products are also affected by other factors, such as product pipeline capacity, system inventory local market conditions and the operating levels of competing refineries. Crude oil costs and the prices of refined products have historically been subject to wide fluctuations. Widespread expansion or upgrades of competitors' facilities, price volatility, international political and economic developments and other factors are likely to continue to play an important role in refining industry economics. These factors can impact, among other things, the level of inventories in the market, resulting in price volatility and a reduction in product margins. Moreover, the refining industry typically experiences seasonal fluctuations in demand for refined products, such as increases in the demand for gasoline during the summer driving season and for volatile seasonal exports of diesel from the United States Gulf Coast markets.\nIn addition to current market conditions, there are long-term factors that may impact the demand for refined products. These factors include mandated renewable fuels standards, proposed climate change laws and regulations and increased mileage standards for vehicles. The petroleum business is also subject to the RFS of the EPA, which requires blending renewable fuels\u201d with transportation fuels or purchase renewable identification numbers ( RINs\u201d), in lieu of blending, by March 31, 2019 or otherwise be subject to penalties. Our cost to comply with RFS is dependent upon a variety of factors, which include the availability of RINs for purchase, the price at which RINs can be purchased, transportation fuel production levels, the mix of our products, as well as the fuel blending performed at our refineries and downstream terminals, all of which can vary significantly from period to period. Based upon recent market prices of RINs and current estimates related to the other variable factors, our estimated cost to comply with RFS is $80 to $90 million for 2019.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 48\n2018 Market Conditions\nThe tables below show relevant market indicators for the petroleum segment, on a per barrels basis, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016:\n_____________________________\n(1)The change over time in NYMEX - WTI, as reflected in the table above, is illustrated below.\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in $/bbl)\n</td> <td>Average 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>At December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>At December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>At December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>WTI\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43.32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50.95\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57.95\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64.77\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48.98\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDecember 31, 2018 | 49\n_____________________________\n(2) Information used in the charts was obtained from MarketView.\nNitrogen Fertilizer\nIn the nitrogen fertilizer segment, earnings and cash flows from operations are primarily affected by the relationship between nitrogen fertilizer product prices, utilization rates, operating costs and expenses.\nThe price at which nitrogen fertilizer products are ultimately sold depends on numerous factors, including the global supply and demand for nitrogen fertilizer products which, in turn, depends on, among other factors, world grain demand and production levels, changes in world population, the cost and availability of fertilizer transportation infrastructure, weather conditions, the availability of imports, and the extent of government intervention in agriculture markets.\nNitrogen fertilizer prices are also affected by local factors, including local market conditions and the operating levels of competing facilities. An expansion or upgrade of competitors' facilities, new facility development, political and economic developments and other factors are likely to continue to play an important role in nitrogen fertilizer industry economics. These factors can impact, among other things, the level of inventories in the market, resulting in price volatility and a reduction in product margins. Moreover, the industry typically experiences seasonal fluctuations in demand for nitrogen fertilizer products.\nWhile there is risk of short-term volatility given the inherent nature of the commodity cycle, the long-term fundamentals for the U.S. nitrogen fertilizer industry remain intact. The nitrogen fertilizer segment views the anticipated combination of (i) increasing global population, (ii) decreasing arable land per capita, (iii) continued evolution to more protein-based diets in developing countries, (iv) sustained use of corn as feedstock for the domestic production of ethanol and (v) positioning at the lower end of the global cost curve will continue to provide a solid foundation for nitrogen fertilizer producers in the U.S over the longer term.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 50\n2018 Market Conditions\nThe table below shows relevant market indicators for the nitrogen fertilizer segment for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017, and 2018:\n_____________________________\n(1)Information used in the charts was obtained from various third party sources including MartketView and the U.S. Energy Information Administration ( EIA\u201d), amongst others.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 51\nNon-GAAP Measures\nOur management uses certain non-GAAP performance measures to evaluate current and past performance and prospects for the future to supplement our GAAP financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are important factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include the performance and liquidity measures defined below.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, management revised its internal and external use of non-GAAP measures. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA\u201d) is now reconciled from net income (loss). Adjusted EBITDA, as defined below, was revised to remove adjustments for (i) first-in-first-out inventory impacts, (ii) derivative gains or losses, and (iii) business interruption insurance recoveries. Additionally, due to the revisions to Adjusted EBITDA to remove certain adjustments, we revised the definitions of our Refining Margin and Direct Operating Expense metrics in our Petroleum segment to conform. Refer to the revised definitions below for further information.\nEBITDA - Consolidated net income (loss) before (i) interest expense, net, (ii) income tax expense (benefit) and (iii) depreciation and amortization expense.\nPetroleum EBITDA and Nitrogen Fertilizer EBITDA - Segment net income (loss) before segment (i) interest expense, net, (ii) income tax expense (benefit), and (iii) depreciation and amortization.\nAdjusted EBITDA - EBITDA adjusted to exclude consolidated turnaround expense and other non-recurring items which management believes are material to an investor's understanding of the Company's underlying operating results.\nPetroleum Adjusted EBITDA and Nitrogen Fertilizer Adjusted EBITDA - Segment EBITDA adjusted to exclude turnaround expense attributable to each segment and other non-recurring segment items which management believes are material to an investor's understanding of the Petroleum or Nitrogen Fertilizer segments' underlying operating results.\nAdjusted net income (loss) is not a recognized term under GAAP and should not be substituted for net income as a measure of our performance, but rather should be utilized as a supplemental measure of financial performance in evaluating our business. Management believes that adjusted net income (loss) provides relevant and useful information that enables external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies, to better understand and evaluate our ongoing operating results and allow for greater transparency in the review of our overall financial, operational and economic performance. Adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share represents adjusted net income (loss) divided by the weighted-average diluted shares outstanding. Adjusted net income (loss) represents net income, as adjusted, that is attributable to CVR Energy stockholders.\nRefining Margin - The difference between our Petroleum Segment net sales and cost of materials and other.\nRefining Margin, excluding Inventory Valuation Impacts - Refining Margin adjusted to exclude the impact of current period market price and volume fluctuations on crude oil and refined product inventories recognized in prior periods. We record our commodity inventories on the first-in-first-out basis. As a result, significant current period fluctuations in market prices and the volumes we hold in inventory can have favorable or unfavorable impacts on our refining margins as compared to similar metrics used by other publicly-traded companies in the refining industry.\nRefining Margin and Refining Margin, excluding Inventory Valuation Impacts, per Total Throughput Barrel - Refining Margin divided by the total throughput barrels during period, which is calculated as total throughput barrels per day times the number of days in the period.\nDirect Operating Expenses per Throughput Barrel - Direct operating expenses for our Petroleum Segment divided by total throughput barrels for the period, which is calculated as total throughput barrels per day times the number of days in the period.\nDirect Operating Expenses per Total Throughput Barrel, excluding Turnaround Expense - Direct operating expenses for our Petroleum segment, excluding turnaround expenses reported as direct operating expense, divided by total throughput barrels for the period, which is calculated as total throughput barrels per day times the number of days in the period.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 52\nWe present these measures because we believe they may help investors, analysts, lenders and ratings agencies analyze our results of operations and liquidity in conjunction with our U.S. GAAP results, including but not limited to our operating performance as compared to other publicly-traded companies in the refining industry, without regard to historical cost basis or financing methods and our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures. Non-GAAP measures have important limitations as analytical tools, because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect net earnings and operating income. These measures should not be considered substitutes for their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. See Non-GAAP Reconciliations\u201d section included herein for reconciliation of these amounts.\nItems or Events Impacting Comparability\nRefer to the Non-GAAP Measures\u201d section above for discussion of the changes made during the fourth quarter of 2018 to the Company's definition of certain non-GAAP measures.\nPetroleum Segment\nStarting with the fourth quarter of 2018, derivative gains or losses are now presented within Cost of Materials and Other. Prior period amounts have been conformed to the current presentation.\nCoffeyville Refinery - During the first quarter of 2018, our Coffeyville, Kansas refinery (the Coffeyville Refinery\u201d) experienced an outage with its fluid catalytic cracking unit ( FCC\u201d) lasting 48 days. The FCC outage had a significant negative impact on production and sales during that period.\nWynnewood Refinery - During 2017, the Wynnewood, Oklahoma ( Wynnewood Refinery\u201d) underwent a turnaround on its hydrocracking unit in the first quarter of 2017 at a cost of $13 million and the first phase of its planned facility turnaround, with the second phase scheduled for the first quarter of 2019, at a cost of approximately $67 million, including $43 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNitrogen Fertilizer Segment\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, the Partnership recognized a $6 million business interruption insurance recovery associated with an outage at its Coffeyville, Kansas facility (the Coffeyville Facility\u201d) during 2017. The recovery is recorded in the Other Income (Expense) line item. Prior year amounts, which were not material, were conformed to the current year presentation.\nCoffeyville Facility - During 2018, our Coffeyville, Kansas nitrogen fertilizer facility (the Coffeyville Facility\u201d) had a planned, full facility turnaround lasting 15 days and incurred approximately $6 million in turnaround expense in the second quarter of 2018. During 2017, the Coffeyville Facility's third-party air separation unit experienced a shut down. Paired with this shut down and subsequent operational challenges, the Coffeyville Facility experienced unplanned UAN downtime of 11 days during the second quarter of 2017.\nEast Dubuque Facility - During 2017, our East Dubuque, Illinois nitrogen fertilizer facility (the East Dubuque Facility\u201d) had a planned, full facility turnaround lasting 14 days and incurred approximately $3 million in turnaround expense in the third quarter of 2017. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2017, the East Dubuque Facility experienced unplanned downtime totaling 12 days.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 53\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated\nThe following sections should be read in conjunction with the information outlined in the previous sections of this Item 7 and the financial statements and related notes thereto in Item 8. Our consolidated results of operations include certain other unallocated corporate activities and the elimination of intercompany transactions and therefore do not equal the sum of the operating results of the petroleum and nitrogen fertilizer segments.\nConsolidated Financial Highlights\n_______________________________________\n(1) See Non-GAAP Reconciliations\u201d section below for reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures shown above.\nOperating Income (Loss) by Segment\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Petroleum\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>599\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nitrogen Fertilizer\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>(18\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>587\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDecember 31, 2018 | 54\nEBITDA by Segment (1)\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Petroleum\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>742\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>187\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nitrogen Fertilizer\n</td> <td>84\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>323\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>265\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________________________\n(1) See Non-GAAP Reconciliations\u201d section below for reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures shown above.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nOverview - Net income attributable to CVR Energy increased by $54 million, or $0.42 per share, from 2017 to 2018 due to significantly improved segment market conditions and operations during 2018 which contributed $479 million of additional operating income year-over-year. These results were offset by an increase in tax expense of $306 million and $140 million in higher earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest given the better results at our business segments. Refer to our detailed discussion of the Petroleum and Nitrogen Fertilizer Segments contained in this section.\nIncome Taxes - In December 2017, we recognized a $201 million tax benefit associated with the remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities upon the enactment of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d), resulting in a total tax benefit of $217 million for 2017. In 2018, we recognized $89 million in tax expense for an effective tax rate of 17.8%. Our effective tax rate was lower than prior years due to the reduction in statutory tax rate as part of the Tax Act.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nOverview - Net income attributable to CVR Energy increased by $210 million, or $2.42 per share, from 2016 to 2017 due to improved operating income driven primarily by an increase of $76 million in the Petroleum Segment offset by a decrease of $36 million in the Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment. The net operational improvement was further aided by an increased tax benefit of $197 million while being offset by $26 million in increased interest costs. Refer to our detailed discussion of the Petroleum and Nitrogen Fertilizer Segments contained in this section.\nInterest Expense - Our 2017 results included $26 million in additional interest costs compared to 2016 due to the full year of interest on the debt incurred for the acquisition of our East Dubuque Fertilizer Facility in April 2016.\nIncome Taxes - In December 2017, we recognized a $200 million benefit associated with the remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities upon the enactment of the Tax Act. No such benefit was recognized in 2016.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 55\nPetroleum Segment\nRefining Throughput and Production Data by Refinery\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2018, management revised its internal and external approach to calculating refinery throughput and production data to include ethanol and biodiesel consumed at the refineries. We believe this revised calculation of refinery throughput and production data is appropriate as it conveys more accurate data reflecting each refinery's operational performance for the period. Prior year balances have been conformed with the current year calculation. The adjustments to the calculation of refinery throughput and production had an immaterial impact on the data presented.\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

below for reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures shown above.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nOverview - The Petroleum Segment's operating results for 2018 compared to 2017 increased due primarily to a significant increase in our refining margin on a total throughput barrel basis. Additionally, turnaround expenses totaled $80 million in 2017 for activities at our Wynnewood Refinery compared to $4 million in 2018 which relate to costs incurred in planning for the Wynnewood Refinery next turnaround in the first quarter of 2019.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 58\nRefining Margin - For the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, refining margin increased significantly on a per total throughput barrel basis largely due to the increase in crack spreads and crude differentials realized during the period. The NYMEX 2-1-1 crack spread increased by $1.23 per barrel, primarily due to an improved distillate crack of $4.22 offset by a decrease in the gasoline crack of $1.77. The Group 3 2-1-1 also improved in 2018 by $1.60 compared to the same period last year, again driven largely by an increase in the distillate crack of $4.74 offset by a decrease in the gasoline crack of $1.52. Given our significant distillate production, we were able realize enhanced capture rates on the NYMEX and Group 3 crack spreads in 2018. Additionally, to our benefit in 2018, crude differentials were significantly higher in 2018 than in 2017. WCS and Midland crude supply availability and take-away constraints widened the discounts to WTI to $26.38 and $7.36 per barrel, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018, respectively, compared to $12.69 and $0.34, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017. In addition, refining margins benefited from a reduction in RFS compliance costs of $189 million driven by the significant price decline in RINs throughout 2018.\nDirect Operating Expenses - Direct operating expenses, excluding turnaround expenses, increased slightly due to lower throughput in 2018 compared to 2017. Our 2018 throughput rates were negatively impacted by the FCCU outage at the Coffeyville Refinery during the first quarter of 2018.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nOverview - The Petroleum Segment's operating results for 2017 compared to 2016 increased due to an increase in our refining margin on a total throughput barrel basis. This increase was offset by turnaround expenses totaling $80 million in 2017 for activities at the Wynnewood Refinery compared to $31 million in 2016 which relate to costs incurred at the Coffeyville Refinery.\nRefining Margin - Our refining margin per barrel of total throughput increased to $9.92 for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $8.47 for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to the improvement in product margins. The benchmark 2-1-1 crack spread improved to $18.19 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $14.66 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2016. Also contributing to the increase in refining margin and 2-1-1 crack spread per barrel was the improvement in the Group 3 gasoline basis to NYMEX gasoline to ($1.83) per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to ($3.62) per barrel in the comparable period in 2016. The per barrel improvement from 2016 to 2017 was offset by increased throughput in 2017. Additionally, the Petroleum Segment incurred an additional $43 million in RFS compliance costs due primarily to unfavorable RINs pricing observed in 2017 compared to 2016.\nNitrogen Fertilizer Segment\nUtilization - The following tables summarize the ammonia utilization at the Coffeyville and East Dubuque facilities. Utilization is an important measure used by management to assess operational output at each of the Partnership's facilities. Utilization is calculated as actual tons produced divided by capacity.\nThe Partnership presents our utilization on a two-year rolling average to take into account the impact of our current turnaround cycles on any specific period. The two-year rolling average is a more useful presentation of the long-term utilization performance of Nitrogen Fertilizer segment's plants.\nThe Partnership present utilization solely on ammonia production rather than each nitrogen product as it provides a comparative baseline against industry peers and eliminates the disparity of plant configurations for upgrade of ammonia into other nitrogen products. With efforts primarily focused on Ammonia upgrade capabilities, this measure is the most meaningful in terms of management success in operations.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 59\nSales and Pricing per Ton - Two of the Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment's key operating metrics are total sales for ammonia and UAN along with the product pricing per ton realized at the gate. Product pricing at gate represents net sales less freight revenue divided by product sales volume in tons and is shown in order to provide a pricing measure that is comparable across the fertilizer industry.\nProduction Volumes - Gross tons produced for ammonia represent the total ammonia produced, including ammonia produced that was upgraded into other fertilizer products. Net tons available for sale represent the ammonia available for sale that was not upgraded into other fertilizer products.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 60\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands of tons)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ammonia (gross produced)\n</td> <td>794\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>694\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ammonia (net available for sale)\n</td> <td>246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>184\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>UAN\n</td> <td>1,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFeedstock.

This increase was benefited primarily from favorable pricing conditions in the second half of 2018 which contributed $37 million in higher revenues. These price increases were offset by $18 million in volume reductions in 2018 as compared to 2017.\nThe following table demonstrates the impact of changes in sales volumes and pricing for the primary components of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017:\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>Price\nVariance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Volume\nVariance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>UAN\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ammonia\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in UAN sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to higher production resulting from less planned and unplanned downtime and a larger amount of product available in inventory as of December 31, 2017. The decrease in ammonia sales volumes for 2018 compared to 2017 was partly attributable to more product being left available for sale as of December 31, 2018 due to a comparatively weaker fall 2018 application as compared to in 2017. Weather was also a significant factor contributing to the decrease in ammonia sales volumes. As a result of a wetter than expected fall season, customers were unable to apply ammonia, resulting in certain customers canceling ammonia contracts for delivery in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 62\nOperating Income (Loss) - For 2018, operating income was $6 million compared to a loss of $10 million in 2017. The $16 million increase in operating income in 2018 is driven by improved market conditions discussed above. The net sales increase was offset by increased feedstock costs, due to higher pet coke, and purchased ammonia prices and higher direct operating expenses driven by an increase of $3 million in turnaround expenses year-over-year. During 2018, our Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility used 5% less pet coke. The facility's cost of pet coke increased due to a higher proportion of pet coke being purchased from third parties at higher prices. The percentage of pet coke obtained from third parties increased from 34% for the year ended December 31, 2017 to 41% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The price for per coke purchased increased by 51% and 56%, respectively, year-over-year, with third party coke increasing from $37 to $56 per ton and internally produced coke increasing from $6 to $10 per ton. Direct operating expenses were higher due to $6 million being spent on the Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility's 2018 turnaround compared to $3 million on the East Dubuque Facility's 2017 turnaround.\nNet Loss - The Nitrogen Fertilizer segment net loss of $50 million decreased significantly as compared to 2017 due to the operational and market improvements discussed above. Additionally, in December 2018, the Nitrogen Fertilizer segment recognized a business interruption insurance recovery of $6 million related to outages at our Coffeyville Facility in 2017 and 2018.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nNet Sales - The Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment's net sales were $331 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $356 million for 2016. The decrease of $25 million was attributable to negative impacts from weaker market conditions. Changes in ammonia and UAN volume did not have a material impact on net sales. The following table demonstrates the impact of changes in sales volumes and pricing for the primary components of net sales for 2017 as compared to 2016:\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>Price\nVariance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Volume\nVariance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>UAN\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(24\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ammonia\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Income (Loss) - For 2017, operating income decreased by $36 million as compared to 2016 to a loss of $10 million. The significant decrease in operating income is primarily due to the unfavorable pricing conditions experienced in 2017. Also contributing in 2017 was an increase of $16 million in depreciation and amortization expense primarily driven by the full year of depreciation recognized in 2017 associated with East Dubuque Fertilizer Facility in April 2016. These increased costs were offset by lower turnaround expense of $4 million year-over-year .\nNet Loss - The Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment's net loss of $73 million in 2017 increased significantly compared to 2016 due to the operational and market conditions and operational expenses incurred in 2017. Additionally, in 2017, an increase of $14 million in interest expense occurred due to a full year of interest on the long-term debt obtained as part of the East Dubuque Facility acquisition in April 2016.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 63\nNon-GAAP Reconciliations\nReconciliation of Net Income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

Resources\nOur principal source of liquidity has historically been cash from operations. Our principal uses of cash are for working capital, capital expenditures, funding our debt service obligations and paying dividends to our stockholders, as further discussed below.\nWe believe that our cash from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents, along with borrowings, as necessary, under the AB Credit Facility ( AB Credit Facility\u201d) and Amended ABL Credit Facility ( Amended ABL Credit Facility\u201d), will be sufficient to satisfy anticipated cash requirements associated with our existing operations for at least the next 12 months, and that we have sufficient cash resources to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. However, our future capital expenditures and other cash requirements could be higher than we currently expect as a result of various factors. Additionally, our ability to generate sufficient cash from our operating activities and secure additional financing depends on our future performance, which is subject to general economic, political, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control.\nDepending on the needs of our business, contractual limitations and market conditions, we may from time to time seek to issue equity securities, incur additional debt, issue debt securities, or otherwise refinance our existing debt. There can be no assurance that we will seek to do any of the foregoing or that we will be able to do any of the foregoing on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nCash Balances and Other Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had consolidated cash and cash equivalents of $668 million, $394 million available under CVR Refining's Amended ABL Credit Facility and $50 million available under CVR Partners' Asset Based Credit Facility.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 67\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CVR Partners:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>9.25% Senior Secured Notes due June 2023\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>645\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6.50% Senior Notes due April 2021\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unamortized discount and debt issuance costs\n</td> <td>(18\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(22\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total CVR Partners Debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>625\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CVR Refining:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6.50% Senior Notes due November 2022\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unamortized debt issuance cost\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current portion of capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total CVR Refining Debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>538\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>539\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Long-Term Debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,164\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAmended ABL Credit Facility - On November 14, 2017, Coffeyville Resources LLC ( CRLLC\u201d), CVR Refining, CVR Refining LLC ( Refining LLC\u201d) and each of the operating subsidiaries of Refining LLC (collectively, the Credit Parties\u201d) entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Amended and Restated ABL Credit Agreement (the Amendment\u201d) with a group of lenders and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ( Wells Fargo\u201d), as administrative agent and collateral agent. The Amendment amends certain provisions of the Amended and Restated ABL Credit Agreement, dated December 20, 2012, by and among Wells Fargo, the group of lenders party thereto and the Credit Parties (the Existing Credit Agreement\u201d and as amended by the Amendment, the Amended and Restated ABL Credit Facility\u201d), which was otherwise scheduled to mature in December 2017. The Amended and Restated ABL Credit Facility is a $400 million asset-based revolving credit facility, with sub-limits for letters of credit and swingline loans of $60 million and $40 million, respectively. The Amended and Restated ABL Credit Facility also includes a $200 million uncommitted incremental facility. The proceeds of the loans may be used for capital expenditures, working capital and general corporate purposes. The Amended and Restated Credit Facility matures in November 2022.\nAB Credit Facility - The Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment has an AB Credit Facility, the proceeds of which may be used to fund working capital and other general corporate purposes. The AB Credit Facility is a senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility with an aggregate principal amount of availability of up to $50.0 million with an incremental facility, which permits an increase in borrowings of up to $25.0 million in the aggregate subject to additional lender commitments and certain other conditions. The AB Credit Facility matures in September 2021. CVR Partners was in compliance with all applicable covenants as of December 31, 2018.\n2023 Notes - CVR Partners issued $645 million aggregate principal amount of 9.250% Senior Secured Notes due 2023 (the 2023 Notes\u201d) in 2016. The 2023 Notes are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by all of the Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment's existing subsidiaries. At any time prior to June 15, 2019, we may on any of one or more occasions redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes issued under the indenture governing the 2023 Notes in an amount not greater than the net proceeds of one or more public equity offerings at a redemption price of 109.250% of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. Prior to June 15, 2019, we may on any one or more occasions redeem all or part of the 2023 Notes at a redemption price equal to the sum of: (i) the principal amount thereof, plus (ii) the make whole premium, as defined in the indenture (the 2023 Indenture\u201d) governing the 2023 Notes, at the redemption date, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the applicable redemption date.\nUpon the occurrence of certain change of control events as defined in the 2023 Indenture (including the sale of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of the Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment and its subsidiaries taken as a whole), each holder of the 2023 Notes will have the right to require that the Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment repurchase all or a portion of such holder's 2023 Notes in cash at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 68\n2022 Notes - CVR Refining's $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.5% Second Lien Senior Notes due 2022 (the 2022 Notes\u201d) are unsecured and fully and unconditionally guaranteed by CVI, CVR Refining and each of Refining LLC's existing domestic subsidiaries (other than the co-issuer, Coffeyville Finance) on a joint and several basis. The 2022 Notes mature on November 1, 2022, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased by the issuers. Interest is payable on the 2022 Notes semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year, to holders of record at the close of business on April 15 and October 15, as the case may be, immediately preceding each such interest payment date.\nCredit Agreement - On January 29, 2019, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) with Jefferies Finance LLC to provide a term loan credit facility with a maturity date of March 10, 2019. The borrowings under the Credit Agreement of $105 million were used to fund a portion of the CVRR Unit Purchase. All amounts were repaid on February 11, 2019.\nCapital Spending\nWe divide capital spending needs into two categories: maintenance and growth. Maintenance capital spending includes non-discretionary maintenance projects and projects required to comply with environmental, health and safety regulations. Growth capital projects generally involve an expansion of existing capacity and/or a reduction in direct operating expenses. We undertake growth capital spending based on the expected return on incremental capital employed.\nOur total capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2018 along with our estimated expenditures for 2019, by segment, are as follows:\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2018 Actual\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019 Estimate (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Maintenance\n</td> <td>Growth\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Maintenance\n</td> <td>Growth\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Low\n</td> <td>High\n</td> <td>Low\n</td> <td>High\n</td> <td>Low\n</td> <td>High\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Petroleum\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>200\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nitrogen Fertilizer\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>65\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>210\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>240\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_____________________________\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Total 2019 estimated capital expenditures includes approximately $50 to 60 million of growth related projects that will require additional approvals before commencement.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur estimated capital expenditures are subject to change due to unanticipated changes in the cost, scope and completion time for capital projects. For example, we may experience increases/decreases in labor or equipment costs necessary to comply with government regulations or to complete projects that sustain or improve the profitability of the refineries or nitrogen fertilizer plants. We may also accelerate or defer some capital expenditures from time to time. Capital spending for CVR Partners is determined by the board of directors of its general partner.\nDividends to CVR Energy Stockholders\nThe Company has a dividend policy. Dividends are subject to change at the discretion of the board of directors. On February 20, 2019, the Company's board of directors declared a cash dividend for the fourth quarter of 2018 to the Company's stockholders of $0.75 per share, or $75 million in the aggregate. The dividend will be paid on March 11, 2019 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 4, 2019.\nDistributions to Unitholders\nFor the fourth quarter of 2018, the CVR Partners, upon approval by its general partner's board of directors on February 20, 2019, declared a distribution of $0.12 per common unit, or $14 million, payable on March 11, 2019 to unitholders of record as of March 4, 2019. Of this amount, we will receive approximately $5 million with remaining amount payable to public unitholders.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 69\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated cash flows for the periods indicated below:\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>620\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>168\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>267\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(196\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(201\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>(334\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(226\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(95\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(254\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(29\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 were approximately $620 million compared to $168 million in 2017. The increase of $452 million as due to the improved operating results from our business as illustrated by the increase of $492 million in EBITDA from 2017 to 2018. This increase was offset by changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities during 2018.\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $99 million from $267 million in 2016. This decrease was the result of significant cash expenditures to purchase RINs for the Petroleum Segment's RFS compliance which more than offset an increase in EBITDA of $58 million year-over-year.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $100 million compared to $196 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease as compared to the prior year is largely a result of the prior year $76 million investment in a Midway Pipeline, LLC ( Midway\u201d) joint venture along with lower capital expenditures in 2018.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $196 million compared to $201 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease of $5 million of cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the net $64 million of cash paid in 2016 for the acquisition of the East Dubuque Fertilizer Facility and $13 million in lower capital expenditures in 2017 compared to 2016. These decreases from 2016 to 2017 were offset by the investment in the Midway joint venture in 2017.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $334 million, as compared to $226 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to dividend payments to common stockholders of $238 million and distributions to CVR Refining common unitholders of $93 million. The increase as compared to the prior year is largely a result of higher dividend and distribution payments being made in the current year by both CVR Energy and CVR Refining.\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $226 million compared to $95 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Dividend payments of $174 million to our common stockholders and distributions of $47 million and $2 million to CVR Refining and CVR Partners common unitholders, respectively, were consistent year-over-year. The increase in net cash used in financing activities of $131 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to the $133 million net proceeds received in 2016 from CVR Partners' issuance of 2023 Notes net of debt repayments in connection with the East Dubuque Fertilizer Facility acquisition.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 70\nLong-Term Commitments\nIn addition to long-term debt, we are required to make payments relating to various types of obligations.

The cost to acquire crude oil and other feedstocks and the price for which refined products are ultimately sold depend on factors beyond the petroleum segment's control, including the supply of and demand for crude oil, as well as, gasoline and other refined products which, in turn, depend on, among other factors, changes in domestic and foreign economies, weather conditions, domestic and foreign political affairs, production levels, the availability of imports, the marketing of competitive fuels and the extent of government regulation. Because the petroleum segment applies first-in first-out accounting to value its inventory, crude oil price movements may impact net income in the short term because of changes in the value of its unhedged inventory. The effect of changes in crude oil prices on the petroleum segment results of operations is partially influenced by the rate at which the process of refined products adjust to reflect these changes.\nThe prices of crude oil and other feedstocks and refined products are also affected by other factors, such as product pipeline capacity, system inventory local market conditions and the operating levels of competing refineries. Crude oil costs and the prices of refined products have historically been subject to wide fluctuations. Widespread expansion or upgrades of competitors' facilities, price volatility, international political and economic developments and other factors are likely to continue to play an important role in refining industry economics. These factors can impact, among other things, the level of inventories in the market, resulting in price volatility and a reduction in product margins. Moreover, the refining industry typically experiences seasonal fluctuations in demand for refined products, such as increases in the demand for gasoline during the summer driving season and for volatile seasonal exports of diesel from the United States Gulf Coast markets.\nIn addition to current market conditions, there are long-term factors that may impact the demand for refined products. These factors include mandated renewable fuels standards, proposed climate change laws and regulations and increased mileage standards for vehicles. The petroleum business is also subject to the RFS of the EPA, which requires blending renewable fuels\u201d with transportation fuels or purchase renewable identification numbers ( RINs\u201d), in lieu of blending, by March 31, 2019 or otherwise be subject to penalties. Our cost to comply with RFS is dependent upon a variety of factors, which include the availability of RINs for purchase, the price at which RINs can be purchased, transportation fuel production levels, the mix of our products, as well as the fuel blending performed at our refineries and downstream terminals, all of which can vary significantly from period to period. Based upon recent market prices of RINs and current estimates related to the other variable factors, our estimated cost to comply with RFS is $80 to $90 million for 2019.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 48\n2018 Market Conditions\nThe tables below show relevant market indicators for the petroleum segment, on a per barrels basis, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016:\n_____________________________\n(1)The change over time in NYMEX - WTI, as reflected in the table above, is illustrated below.\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in $/bbl)\n</td> <td>Average 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>At December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>At December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>At December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>WTI\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43.32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50.95\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57.95\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64.77\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48.98\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDecember 31, 2018 | 49\n_____________________________\n(2) Information used in the charts was obtained from MarketView.\nNitrogen Fertilizer\nIn the nitrogen fertilizer segment, earnings and cash flows from operations are primarily affected by the relationship between nitrogen fertilizer product prices, utilization rates, operating costs and expenses.\nThe price at which nitrogen fertilizer products are ultimately sold depends on numerous factors, including the global supply and demand for nitrogen fertilizer products which, in turn, depends on, among other factors, world grain demand and production levels, changes in world population, the cost and availability of fertilizer transportation infrastructure, weather conditions, the availability of imports, and the extent of government intervention in agriculture markets.\nNitrogen fertilizer prices are also affected by local factors, including local market conditions and the operating levels of competing facilities. An expansion or upgrade of competitors' facilities, new facility development, political and economic developments and other factors are likely to continue to play an important role in nitrogen fertilizer industry economics. These factors can impact, among other things, the level of inventories in the market, resulting in price volatility and a reduction in product margins. Moreover, the industry typically experiences seasonal fluctuations in demand for nitrogen fertilizer products.\nWhile there is risk of short-term volatility given the inherent nature of the commodity cycle, the long-term fundamentals for the U.S. nitrogen fertilizer industry remain intact. The nitrogen fertilizer segment views the anticipated combination of (i) increasing global population, (ii) decreasing arable land per capita, (iii) continued evolution to more protein-based diets in developing countries, (iv) sustained use of corn as feedstock for the domestic production of ethanol and (v) positioning at the lower end of the global cost curve will continue to provide a solid foundation for nitrogen fertilizer producers in the U.S over the longer term.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 50\n2018 Market Conditions\nThe table below shows relevant market indicators for the nitrogen fertilizer segment for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017, and 2018:\n_____________________________\n(1)Information used in the charts was obtained from various third party sources including MartketView and the U.S. Energy Information Administration ( EIA\u201d), amongst others.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 51\nNon-GAAP Measures\nOur management uses certain non-GAAP performance measures to evaluate current and past performance and prospects for the future to supplement our GAAP financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are important factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include the performance and liquidity measures defined below.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, management revised its internal and external use of non-GAAP measures. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA\u201d) is now reconciled from net income (loss). Adjusted EBITDA, as defined below, was revised to remove adjustments for (i) first-in-first-out inventory impacts, (ii) derivative gains or losses, and (iii) business interruption insurance recoveries. Additionally, due to the revisions to Adjusted EBITDA to remove certain adjustments, we revised the definitions of our Refining Margin and Direct Operating Expense metrics in our Petroleum segment to conform. Refer to the revised definitions below for further information.\nEBITDA - Consolidated net income (loss) before (i) interest expense, net, (ii) income tax expense (benefit) and (iii) depreciation and amortization expense.\nPetroleum EBITDA and Nitrogen Fertilizer EBITDA - Segment net income (loss) before segment (i) interest expense, net, (ii) income tax expense (benefit), and (iii) depreciation and amortization.\nAdjusted EBITDA - EBITDA adjusted to exclude consolidated turnaround expense and other non-recurring items which management believes are material to an investor's understanding of the Company's underlying operating results.\nPetroleum Adjusted EBITDA and Nitrogen Fertilizer Adjusted EBITDA - Segment EBITDA adjusted to exclude turnaround expense attributable to each segment and other non-recurring segment items which management believes are material to an investor's understanding of the Petroleum or Nitrogen Fertilizer segments' underlying operating results.\nAdjusted net income (loss) is not a recognized term under GAAP and should not be substituted for net income as a measure of our performance, but rather should be utilized as a supplemental measure of financial performance in evaluating our business. Management believes that adjusted net income (loss) provides relevant and useful information that enables external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies, to better understand and evaluate our ongoing operating results and allow for greater transparency in the review of our overall financial, operational and economic performance. Adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share represents adjusted net income (loss) divided by the weighted-average diluted shares outstanding. Adjusted net income (loss) represents net income, as adjusted, that is attributable to CVR Energy stockholders.\nRefining Margin - The difference between our Petroleum Segment net sales and cost of materials and other.\nRefining Margin, excluding Inventory Valuation Impacts - Refining Margin adjusted to exclude the impact of current period market price and volume fluctuations on crude oil and refined product inventories recognized in prior periods. We record our commodity inventories on the first-in-first-out basis. As a result, significant current period fluctuations in market prices and the volumes we hold in inventory can have favorable or unfavorable impacts on our refining margins as compared to similar metrics used by other publicly-traded companies in the refining industry.\nRefining Margin and Refining Margin, excluding Inventory Valuation Impacts, per Total Throughput Barrel - Refining Margin divided by the total throughput barrels during period, which is calculated as total throughput barrels per day times the number of days in the period.\nDirect Operating Expenses per Throughput Barrel - Direct operating expenses for our Petroleum Segment divided by total throughput barrels for the period, which is calculated as total throughput barrels per day times the number of days in the period.\nDirect Operating Expenses per Total Throughput Barrel, excluding Turnaround Expense - Direct operating expenses for our Petroleum segment, excluding turnaround expenses reported as direct operating expense, divided by total throughput barrels for the period, which is calculated as total throughput barrels per day times the number of days in the period.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 52\nWe present these measures because we believe they may help investors, analysts, lenders and ratings agencies analyze our results of operations and liquidity in conjunction with our U.S. GAAP results, including but not limited to our operating performance as compared to other publicly-traded companies in the refining industry, without regard to historical cost basis or financing methods and our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures. Non-GAAP measures have important limitations as analytical tools, because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect net earnings and operating income. These measures should not be considered substitutes for their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. See Non-GAAP Reconciliations\u201d section included herein for reconciliation of these amounts.\nItems or Events Impacting Comparability\nRefer to the Non-GAAP Measures\u201d section above for discussion of the changes made during the fourth quarter of 2018 to the Company's definition of certain non-GAAP measures.\nPetroleum Segment\nStarting with the fourth quarter of 2018, derivative gains or losses are now presented within Cost of Materials and Other. Prior period amounts have been conformed to the current presentation.\nCoffeyville Refinery - During the first quarter of 2018, our Coffeyville, Kansas refinery (the Coffeyville Refinery\u201d) experienced an outage with its fluid catalytic cracking unit ( FCC\u201d) lasting 48 days. The FCC outage had a significant negative impact on production and sales during that period.\nWynnewood Refinery - During 2017, the Wynnewood, Oklahoma ( Wynnewood Refinery\u201d) underwent a turnaround on its hydrocracking unit in the first quarter of 2017 at a cost of $13 million and the first phase of its planned facility turnaround, with the second phase scheduled for the first quarter of 2019, at a cost of approximately $67 million, including $43 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNitrogen Fertilizer Segment\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, the Partnership recognized a $6 million business interruption insurance recovery associated with an outage at its Coffeyville, Kansas facility (the Coffeyville Facility\u201d) during 2017. The recovery is recorded in the Other Income (Expense) line item. Prior year amounts, which were not material, were conformed to the current year presentation.\nCoffeyville Facility - During 2018, our Coffeyville, Kansas nitrogen fertilizer facility (the Coffeyville Facility\u201d) had a planned, full facility turnaround lasting 15 days and incurred approximately $6 million in turnaround expense in the second quarter of 2018. During 2017, the Coffeyville Facility's third-party air separation unit experienced a shut down. Paired with this shut down and subsequent operational challenges, the Coffeyville Facility experienced unplanned UAN downtime of 11 days during the second quarter of 2017.\nEast Dubuque Facility - During 2017, our East Dubuque, Illinois nitrogen fertilizer facility (the East Dubuque Facility\u201d) had a planned, full facility turnaround lasting 14 days and incurred approximately $3 million in turnaround expense in the third quarter of 2017. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2017, the East Dubuque Facility experienced unplanned downtime totaling 12 days.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 53\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated\nThe following sections should be read in conjunction with the information outlined in the previous sections of this Item 7 and the financial statements and related notes thereto in Item 8. Our consolidated results of operations include certain other unallocated corporate activities and the elimination of intercompany transactions and therefore do not equal the sum of the operating results of the petroleum and nitrogen fertilizer segments.\nConsolidated Financial Highlights\n_______________________________________\n(1) See Non-GAAP Reconciliations\u201d section below for reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures shown above.\nOperating Income (Loss) by Segment\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Petroleum\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>599\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nitrogen Fertilizer\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>(18\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>587\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDecember 31, 2018 | 54\nEBITDA by Segment (1)\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Petroleum\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>742\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>187\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nitrogen Fertilizer\n</td> <td>84\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>323\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>265\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________________________\n(1) See Non-GAAP Reconciliations\u201d section below for reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures shown above.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nOverview - Net income attributable to CVR Energy increased by $54 million, or $0.42 per share, from 2017 to 2018 due to significantly improved segment market conditions and operations during 2018 which contributed $479 million of additional operating income year-over-year. These results were offset by an increase in tax expense of $306 million and $140 million in higher earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest given the better results at our business segments. Refer to our detailed discussion of the Petroleum and Nitrogen Fertilizer Segments contained in this section.\nIncome Taxes - In December 2017, we recognized a $201 million tax benefit associated with the remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities upon the enactment of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d), resulting in a total tax benefit of $217 million for 2017. In 2018, we recognized $89 million in tax expense for an effective tax rate of 17.8%. Our effective tax rate was lower than prior years due to the reduction in statutory tax rate as part of the Tax Act.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nOverview - Net income attributable to CVR Energy increased by $210 million, or $2.42 per share, from 2016 to 2017 due to improved operating income driven primarily by an increase of $76 million in the Petroleum Segment offset by a decrease of $36 million in the Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment. The net operational improvement was further aided by an increased tax benefit of $197 million while being offset by $26 million in increased interest costs. Refer to our detailed discussion of the Petroleum and Nitrogen Fertilizer Segments contained in this section.\nInterest Expense - Our 2017 results included $26 million in additional interest costs compared to 2016 due to the full year of interest on the debt incurred for the acquisition of our East Dubuque Fertilizer Facility in April 2016.\nIncome Taxes - In December 2017, we recognized a $200 million benefit associated with the remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities upon the enactment of the Tax Act. No such benefit was recognized in 2016.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 55\nPetroleum Segment\nRefining Throughput and Production Data by Refinery\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2018, management revised its internal and external approach to calculating refinery throughput and production data to include ethanol and biodiesel consumed at the refineries. We believe this revised calculation of refinery throughput and production data is appropriate as it conveys more accurate data reflecting each refinery's operational performance for the period. Prior year balances have been conformed with the current year calculation. The adjustments to the calculation of refinery throughput and production had an immaterial impact on the data presented.\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

2018 compared to 2017 increased due primarily to a significant increase in our refining margin on a total throughput barrel basis. Additionally, turnaround expenses totaled $80 million in 2017 for activities at our Wynnewood Refinery compared to $4 million in 2018 which relate to costs incurred in planning for the Wynnewood Refinery next turnaround in the first quarter of 2019.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 58\nRefining Margin - For the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, refining margin increased significantly on a per total throughput barrel basis largely due to the increase in crack spreads and crude differentials realized during the period. The NYMEX 2-1-1 crack spread increased by $1.23 per barrel, primarily due to an improved distillate crack of $4.22 offset by a decrease in the gasoline crack of $1.77. The Group 3 2-1-1 also improved in 2018 by $1.60 compared to the same period last year, again driven largely by an increase in the distillate crack of $4.74 offset by a decrease in the gasoline crack of $1.52. Given our significant distillate production, we were able realize enhanced capture rates on the NYMEX and Group 3 crack spreads in 2018. Additionally, to our benefit in 2018, crude differentials were significantly higher in 2018 than in 2017. WCS and Midland crude supply availability and take-away constraints widened the discounts to WTI to $26.38 and $7.36 per barrel, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018, respectively, compared to $12.69 and $0.34, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017. In addition, refining margins benefited from a reduction in RFS compliance costs of $189 million driven by the significant price decline in RINs throughout 2018.\nDirect Operating Expenses - Direct operating expenses, excluding turnaround expenses, increased slightly due to lower throughput in 2018 compared to 2017. Our 2018 throughput rates were negatively impacted by the FCCU outage at the Coffeyville Refinery during the first quarter of 2018.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nOverview - The Petroleum Segment's operating results for 2017 compared to 2016 increased due to an increase in our refining margin on a total throughput barrel basis. This increase was offset by turnaround expenses totaling $80 million in 2017 for activities at the Wynnewood Refinery compared to $31 million in 2016 which relate to costs incurred at the Coffeyville Refinery.\nRefining Margin - Our refining margin per barrel of total throughput increased to $9.92 for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $8.47 for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to the improvement in product margins. The benchmark 2-1-1 crack spread improved to $18.19 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $14.66 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2016. Also contributing to the increase in refining margin and 2-1-1 crack spread per barrel was the improvement in the Group 3 gasoline basis to NYMEX gasoline to ($1.83) per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to ($3.62) per barrel in the comparable period in 2016. The per barrel improvement from 2016 to 2017 was offset by increased throughput in 2017. Additionally, the Petroleum Segment incurred an additional $43 million in RFS compliance costs due primarily to unfavorable RINs pricing observed in 2017 compared to 2016.\nNitrogen Fertilizer Segment\nUtilization - The following tables summarize the ammonia utilization at the Coffeyville and East Dubuque facilities. Utilization is an important measure used by management to assess operational output at each of the Partnership's facilities. Utilization is calculated as actual tons produced divided by capacity.\nThe Partnership presents our utilization on a two-year rolling average to take into account the impact of our current turnaround cycles on any specific period. The two-year rolling average is a more useful presentation of the long-term utilization performance of Nitrogen Fertilizer segment's plants.\nThe Partnership present utilization solely on ammonia production rather than each nitrogen product as it provides a comparative baseline against industry peers and eliminates the disparity of plant configurations for upgrade of ammonia into other nitrogen products. With efforts primarily focused on Ammonia upgrade capabilities, this measure is the most meaningful in terms of management success in operations.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 59\nSales and Pricing per Ton - Two of the Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment's key operating metrics are total sales for ammonia and UAN along with the product pricing per ton realized at the gate. Product pricing at gate represents net sales less freight revenue divided by product sales volume in tons and is shown in order to provide a pricing measure that is comparable across the fertilizer industry.\nProduction Volumes - Gross tons produced for ammonia represent the total ammonia produced, including ammonia produced that was upgraded into other fertilizer products. Net tons available for sale represent the ammonia available for sale that was not upgraded into other fertilizer products.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 60\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands of tons)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ammonia (gross produced)\n</td> <td>794\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>694\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ammonia (net available for sale)\n</td> <td>246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>184\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>UAN\n</td> <td>1,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFeedstock.

This increase was benefited primarily from favorable pricing conditions in the second half of 2018 which contributed $37 million in higher revenues. These price increases were offset by $18 million in volume reductions in 2018 as compared to 2017.\nThe following table demonstrates the impact of changes in sales volumes and pricing for the primary components of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017:\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>Price\nVariance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Volume\nVariance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>UAN\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ammonia\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in UAN sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to higher production resulting from less planned and unplanned downtime and a larger amount of product available in inventory as of December 31, 2017. The decrease in ammonia sales volumes for 2018 compared to 2017 was partly attributable to more product being left available for sale as of December 31, 2018 due to a comparatively weaker fall 2018 application as compared to in 2017. Weather was also a significant factor contributing to the decrease in ammonia sales volumes. As a result of a wetter than expected fall season, customers were unable to apply ammonia, resulting in certain customers canceling ammonia contracts for delivery in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 62\nOperating Income (Loss) - For 2018, operating income was $6 million compared to a loss of $10 million in 2017. The $16 million increase in operating income in 2018 is driven by improved market conditions discussed above. The net sales increase was offset by increased feedstock costs, due to higher pet coke, and purchased ammonia prices and higher direct operating expenses driven by an increase of $3 million in turnaround expenses year-over-year. During 2018, our Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility used 5% less pet coke. The facility's cost of pet coke increased due to a higher proportion of pet coke being purchased from third parties at higher prices. The percentage of pet coke obtained from third parties increased from 34% for the year ended December 31, 2017 to 41% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The price for per coke purchased increased by 51% and 56%, respectively, year-over-year, with third party coke increasing from $37 to $56 per ton and internally produced coke increasing from $6 to $10 per ton. Direct operating expenses were higher due to $6 million being spent on the Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility's 2018 turnaround compared to $3 million on the East Dubuque Facility's 2017 turnaround.\nNet Loss - The Nitrogen Fertilizer segment net loss of $50 million decreased significantly as compared to 2017 due to the operational and market improvements discussed above. Additionally, in December 2018, the Nitrogen Fertilizer segment recognized a business interruption insurance recovery of $6 million related to outages at our Coffeyville Facility in 2017 and 2018.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nNet Sales - The Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment's net sales were $331 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $356 million for 2016. The decrease of $25 million was attributable to negative impacts from weaker market conditions. Changes in ammonia and UAN volume did not have a material impact on net sales. The following table demonstrates the impact of changes in sales volumes and pricing for the primary components of net sales for 2017 as compared to 2016:\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>Price\nVariance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Volume\nVariance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>UAN\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(24\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ammonia\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Income (Loss) - For 2017, operating income decreased by $36 million as compared to 2016 to a loss of $10 million. The significant decrease in operating income is primarily due to the unfavorable pricing conditions experienced in 2017. Also contributing in 2017 was an increase of $16 million in depreciation and amortization expense primarily driven by the full year of depreciation recognized in 2017 associated with East Dubuque Fertilizer Facility in April 2016. These increased costs were offset by lower turnaround expense of $4 million year-over-year .\nNet Loss - The Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment's net loss of $73 million in 2017 increased significantly compared to 2016 due to the operational and market conditions and operational expenses incurred in 2017. Additionally, in 2017, an increase of $14 million in interest expense occurred due to a full year of interest on the long-term debt obtained as part of the East Dubuque Facility acquisition in April 2016.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 63\nNon-GAAP Reconciliations\nReconciliation of Net Income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

Resources\nOur principal source of liquidity has historically been cash from operations. Our principal uses of cash are for working capital, capital expenditures, funding our debt service obligations and paying dividends to our stockholders, as further discussed below.\nWe believe that our cash from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents, along with borrowings, as necessary, under the AB Credit Facility ( AB Credit Facility\u201d) and Amended ABL Credit Facility ( Amended ABL Credit Facility\u201d), will be sufficient to satisfy anticipated cash requirements associated with our existing operations for at least the next 12 months, and that we have sufficient cash resources to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. However, our future capital expenditures and other cash requirements could be higher than we currently expect as a result of various factors. Additionally, our ability to generate sufficient cash from our operating activities and secure additional financing depends on our future performance, which is subject to general economic, political, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control.\nDepending on the needs of our business, contractual limitations and market conditions, we may from time to time seek to issue equity securities, incur additional debt, issue debt securities, or otherwise refinance our existing debt. There can be no assurance that we will seek to do any of the foregoing or that we will be able to do any of the foregoing on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nCash Balances and Other Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had consolidated cash and cash equivalents of $668 million, $394 million available under CVR Refining's Amended ABL Credit Facility and $50 million available under CVR Partners' Asset Based Credit Facility.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 67\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CVR Partners:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>9.25% Senior Secured Notes due June 2023\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>645\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6.50% Senior Notes due April 2021\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unamortized discount and debt issuance costs\n</td> <td>(18\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(22\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total CVR Partners Debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>625\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CVR Refining:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6.50% Senior Notes due November 2022\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unamortized debt issuance cost\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current portion of capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total CVR Refining Debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>538\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>539\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Long-Term Debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,164\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAmended ABL Credit Facility - On November 14, 2017, Coffeyville Resources LLC ( CRLLC\u201d), CVR Refining, CVR Refining LLC ( Refining LLC\u201d) and each of the operating subsidiaries of Refining LLC (collectively, the Credit Parties\u201d) entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Amended and Restated ABL Credit Agreement (the Amendment\u201d) with a group of lenders and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ( Wells Fargo\u201d), as administrative agent and collateral agent. The Amendment amends certain provisions of the Amended and Restated ABL Credit Agreement, dated December 20, 2012, by and among Wells Fargo, the group of lenders party thereto and the Credit Parties (the Existing Credit Agreement\u201d and as amended by the Amendment, the Amended and Restated ABL Credit Facility\u201d), which was otherwise scheduled to mature in December 2017. The Amended and Restated ABL Credit Facility is a $400 million asset-based revolving credit facility, with sub-limits for letters of credit and swingline loans of $60 million and $40 million, respectively. The Amended and Restated ABL Credit Facility also includes a $200 million uncommitted incremental facility. The proceeds of the loans may be used for capital expenditures, working capital and general corporate purposes. The Amended and Restated Credit Facility matures in November 2022.\nAB Credit Facility - The Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment has an AB Credit Facility, the proceeds of which may be used to fund working capital and other general corporate purposes. The AB Credit Facility is a senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility with an aggregate principal amount of availability of up to $50.0 million with an incremental facility, which permits an increase in borrowings of up to $25.0 million in the aggregate subject to additional lender commitments and certain other conditions. The AB Credit Facility matures in September 2021. CVR Partners was in compliance with all applicable covenants as of December 31, 2018.\n2023 Notes - CVR Partners issued $645 million aggregate principal amount of 9.250% Senior Secured Notes due 2023 (the 2023 Notes\u201d) in 2016. The 2023 Notes are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by all of the Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment's existing subsidiaries. At any time prior to June 15, 2019, we may on any of one or more occasions redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes issued under the indenture governing the 2023 Notes in an amount not greater than the net proceeds of one or more public equity offerings at a redemption price of 109.250% of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. Prior to June 15, 2019, we may on any one or more occasions redeem all or part of the 2023 Notes at a redemption price equal to the sum of: (i) the principal amount thereof, plus (ii) the make whole premium, as defined in the indenture (the 2023 Indenture\u201d) governing the 2023 Notes, at the redemption date, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the applicable redemption date.\nUpon the occurrence of certain change of control events as defined in the 2023 Indenture (including the sale of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of the Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment and its subsidiaries taken as a whole), each holder of the 2023 Notes will have the right to require that the Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment repurchase all or a portion of such holder's 2023 Notes in cash at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 68\n2022 Notes - CVR Refining's $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.5% Second Lien Senior Notes due 2022 (the 2022 Notes\u201d) are unsecured and fully and unconditionally guaranteed by CVI, CVR Refining and each of Refining LLC's existing domestic subsidiaries (other than the co-issuer, Coffeyville Finance) on a joint and several basis. The 2022 Notes mature on November 1, 2022, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased by the issuers. Interest is payable on the 2022 Notes semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year, to holders of record at the close of business on April 15 and October 15, as the case may be, immediately preceding each such interest payment date.\nCredit Agreement - On January 29, 2019, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) with Jefferies Finance LLC to provide a term loan credit facility with a maturity date of March 10, 2019. The borrowings under the Credit Agreement of $105 million were used to fund a portion of the CVRR Unit Purchase. All amounts were repaid on February 11, 2019.\nCapital Spending\nWe divide capital spending needs into two categories: maintenance and growth. Maintenance capital spending includes non-discretionary maintenance projects and projects required to comply with environmental, health and safety regulations. Growth capital projects generally involve an expansion of existing capacity and/or a reduction in direct operating expenses. We undertake growth capital spending based on the expected return on incremental capital employed.\nOur total capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2018 along with our estimated expenditures for 2019, by segment, are as follows:\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2018 Actual\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019 Estimate (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Maintenance\n</td> <td>Growth\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Maintenance\n</td> <td>Growth\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Low\n</td> <td>High\n</td> <td>Low\n</td> <td>High\n</td> <td>Low\n</td> <td>High\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Petroleum\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>200\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nitrogen Fertilizer\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>65\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>210\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>240\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_____________________________\n (1) Total 2019 estimated capital expenditures includes approximately $50 to 60 million of growth related projects that will require additional approvals before commencement. \nOur estimated capital expenditures are subject to change due to unanticipated changes in the cost, scope and completion time for capital projects. For example, we may experience increases/decreases in labor or equipment costs necessary to comply with government regulations or to complete projects that sustain or improve the profitability of the refineries or nitrogen fertilizer plants. We may also accelerate or defer some capital expenditures from time to time. Capital spending for CVR Partners is determined by the board of directors of its general partner.\nDividends to CVR Energy Stockholders\nThe Company has a dividend policy. Dividends are subject to change at the discretion of the board of directors. On February 20, 2019, the Company's board of directors declared a cash dividend for the fourth quarter of 2018 to the Company's stockholders of $0.75 per share, or $75 million in the aggregate. The dividend will be paid on March 11, 2019 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 4, 2019.\nDistributions to Unitholders\nFor the fourth quarter of 2018, the CVR Partners, upon approval by its general partner's board of directors on February 20, 2019, declared a distribution of $0.12 per common unit, or $14 million, payable on March 11, 2019 to unitholders of record as of March 4, 2019. Of this amount, we will receive approximately $5 million with remaining amount payable to public unitholders.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 69\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated cash flows for the periods indicated below:\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>620\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>168\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>267\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(196\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(201\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>(334\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(226\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(95\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(254\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(29\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 were approximately $620 million compared to $168 million in 2017. The increase of $452 million as due to the improved operating results from our business as illustrated by the increase of $492 million in EBITDA from 2017 to 2018. This increase was offset by changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities during 2018.\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $99 million from $267 million in 2016. This decrease was the result of significant cash expenditures to purchase RINs for the Petroleum Segment's RFS compliance which more than offset an increase in EBITDA of $58 million year-over-year.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $100 million compared to $196 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease as compared to the prior year is largely a result of the prior year $76 million investment in a Midway Pipeline, LLC ( Midway\u201d) joint venture along with lower capital expenditures in 2018.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $196 million compared to $201 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease of $5 million of cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the net $64 million of cash paid in 2016 for the acquisition of the East Dubuque Fertilizer Facility and $13 million in lower capital expenditures in 2017 compared to 2016. These decreases from 2016 to 2017 were offset by the investment in the Midway joint venture in 2017.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $334 million, as compared to $226 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to dividend payments to common stockholders of $238 million and distributions to CVR Refining common unitholders of $93 million. The increase as compared to the prior year is largely a result of higher dividend and distribution payments being made in the current year by both CVR Energy and CVR Refining.\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $226 million compared to $95 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Dividend payments of $174 million to our common stockholders and distributions of $47 million and $2 million to CVR Refining and CVR Partners common unitholders, respectively, were consistent year-over-year. The increase in net cash used in financing activities of $131 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to the $133 million net proceeds received in 2016 from CVR Partners' issuance of 2023 Notes net of debt repayments in connection with the East Dubuque Fertilizer Facility acquisition.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 70\nLong-Term Commitments\nIn addition to long-term debt, we are required to make payments relating to various types of obligations.

The cost to acquire crude oil and other feedstocks and the price for which refined products are ultimately sold depend on factors beyond the petroleum segment's control, including the supply of and demand for crude oil, as well as, gasoline and other refined products which, in turn, depend on, among other factors, changes in domestic and foreign economies, weather conditions, domestic and foreign political affairs, production levels, the availability of imports, the marketing of competitive fuels and the extent of government regulation. Because the petroleum segment applies first-in first-out accounting to value its inventory, crude oil price movements may impact net income in the short term because of changes in the value of its unhedged inventory. The effect of changes in crude oil prices on the petroleum segment results of operations is partially influenced by the rate at which the process of refined products adjust to reflect these changes.\nThe prices of crude oil and other feedstocks and refined products are also affected by other factors, such as product pipeline capacity, system inventory local market conditions and the operating levels of competing refineries. Crude oil costs and the prices of refined products have historically been subject to wide fluctuations. Widespread expansion or upgrades of competitors' facilities, price volatility, international political and economic developments and other factors are likely to continue to play an important role in refining industry economics. These factors can impact, among other things, the level of inventories in the market, resulting in price volatility and a reduction in product margins. Moreover, the refining industry typically experiences seasonal fluctuations in demand for refined products, such as increases in the demand for gasoline during the summer driving season and for volatile seasonal exports of diesel from the United States Gulf Coast markets.\nIn addition to current market conditions, there are long-term factors that may impact the demand for refined products. These factors include mandated renewable fuels standards, proposed climate change laws and regulations and increased mileage standards for vehicles. The petroleum business is also subject to the RFS of the EPA, which requires blending renewable fuels\u201d with transportation fuels or purchase renewable identification numbers ( RINs\u201d), in lieu of blending, by March 31, 2019 or otherwise be subject to penalties. Our cost to comply with RFS is dependent upon a variety of factors, which include the availability of RINs for purchase, the price at which RINs can be purchased, transportation fuel production levels, the mix of our products, as well as the fuel blending performed at our refineries and downstream terminals, all of which can vary significantly from period to period. Based upon recent market prices of RINs and current estimates related to the other variable factors, our estimated cost to comply with RFS is $80 to $90 million for 2019.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 48\n2018 Market Conditions\nThe tables below show relevant market indicators for the petroleum segment, on a per barrels basis, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016:\n_____________________________\n(1)The change over time in NYMEX - WTI, as reflected in the table above, is illustrated below.\n\nDecember 31, 2018 | 49\n_____________________________\n(2) Information used in the charts was obtained from MarketView.\nNitrogen Fertilizer\nIn the nitrogen fertilizer segment, earnings and cash flows from operations are primarily affected by the relationship between nitrogen fertilizer product prices, utilization rates, operating costs and expenses.\nThe price at which nitrogen fertilizer products are ultimately sold depends on numerous factors, including the global supply and demand for nitrogen fertilizer products which, in turn, depends on, among other factors, world grain demand and production levels, changes in world population, the cost and availability of fertilizer transportation infrastructure, weather conditions, the availability of imports, and the extent of government intervention in agriculture markets.\nNitrogen fertilizer prices are also affected by local factors, including local market conditions and the operating levels of competing facilities. An expansion or upgrade of competitors' facilities, new facility development, political and economic developments and other factors are likely to continue to play an important role in nitrogen fertilizer industry economics. These factors can impact, among other things, the level of inventories in the market, resulting in price volatility and a reduction in product margins. Moreover, the industry typically experiences seasonal fluctuations in demand for nitrogen fertilizer products.\nWhile there is risk of short-term volatility given the inherent nature of the commodity cycle, the long-term fundamentals for the U.S. nitrogen fertilizer industry remain intact. The nitrogen fertilizer segment views the anticipated combination of (i) increasing global population, (ii) decreasing arable land per capita, (iii) continued evolution to more protein-based diets in developing countries, (iv) sustained use of corn as feedstock for the domestic production of ethanol and (v) positioning at the lower end of the global cost curve will continue to provide a solid foundation for nitrogen fertilizer producers in the U.S over the longer term.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 50\n2018 Market Conditions\nThe table below shows relevant market indicators for the nitrogen fertilizer segment for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017, and 2018:\n_____________________________\n(1)Information used in the charts was obtained from various third party sources including MartketView and the U.S. Energy Information Administration ( EIA\u201d), amongst others.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 51\nNon-GAAP Measures\nOur management uses certain non-GAAP performance measures to evaluate current and past performance and prospects for the future to supplement our GAAP financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are important factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include the performance and liquidity measures defined below.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, management revised its internal and external use of non-GAAP measures. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA\u201d) is now reconciled from net income (loss). Adjusted EBITDA, as defined below, was revised to remove adjustments for (i) first-in-first-out inventory impacts, (ii) derivative gains or losses, and (iii) business interruption insurance recoveries. Additionally, due to the revisions to Adjusted EBITDA to remove certain adjustments, we revised the definitions of our Refining Margin and Direct Operating Expense metrics in our Petroleum segment to conform. Refer to the revised definitions below for further information.\nEBITDA - Consolidated net income (loss) before (i) interest expense, net, (ii) income tax expense (benefit) and (iii) depreciation and amortization expense.\nPetroleum EBITDA and Nitrogen Fertilizer EBITDA - Segment net income (loss) before segment (i) interest expense, net, (ii) income tax expense (benefit), and (iii) depreciation and amortization.\nAdjusted EBITDA - EBITDA adjusted to exclude consolidated turnaround expense and other non-recurring items which management believes are material to an investor's understanding of the Company's underlying operating results.\nPetroleum Adjusted EBITDA and Nitrogen Fertilizer Adjusted EBITDA - Segment EBITDA adjusted to exclude turnaround expense attributable to each segment and other non-recurring segment items which management believes are material to an investor's understanding of the Petroleum or Nitrogen Fertilizer segments' underlying operating results.\nAdjusted net income (loss) is not a recognized term under GAAP and should not be substituted for net income as a measure of our performance, but rather should be utilized as a supplemental measure of financial performance in evaluating our business. Management believes that adjusted net income (loss) provides relevant and useful information that enables external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies, to better understand and evaluate our ongoing operating results and allow for greater transparency in the review of our overall financial, operational and economic performance. Adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share represents adjusted net income (loss) divided by the weighted-average diluted shares outstanding. Adjusted net income (loss) represents net income, as adjusted, that is attributable to CVR Energy stockholders.\nRefining Margin - The difference between our Petroleum Segment net sales and cost of materials and other.\nRefining Margin, excluding Inventory Valuation Impacts - Refining Margin adjusted to exclude the impact of current period market price and volume fluctuations on crude oil and refined product inventories recognized in prior periods. We record our commodity inventories on the first-in-first-out basis. As a result, significant current period fluctuations in market prices and the volumes we hold in inventory can have favorable or unfavorable impacts on our refining margins as compared to similar metrics used by other publicly-traded companies in the refining industry.\nRefining Margin and Refining Margin, excluding Inventory Valuation Impacts, per Total Throughput Barrel - Refining Margin divided by the total throughput barrels during period, which is calculated as total throughput barrels per day times the number of days in the period.\nDirect Operating Expenses per Throughput Barrel - Direct operating expenses for our Petroleum Segment divided by total throughput barrels for the period, which is calculated as total throughput barrels per day times the number of days in the period.\nDirect Operating Expenses per Total Throughput Barrel, excluding Turnaround Expense - Direct operating expenses for our Petroleum segment, excluding turnaround expenses reported as direct operating expense, divided by total throughput barrels for the period, which is calculated as total throughput barrels per day times the number of days in the period.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 52\nWe present these measures because we believe they may help investors, analysts, lenders and ratings agencies analyze our results of operations and liquidity in conjunction with our U.S. GAAP results, including but not limited to our operating performance as compared to other publicly-traded companies in the refining industry, without regard to historical cost basis or financing methods and our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures. Non-GAAP measures have important limitations as analytical tools, because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect net earnings and operating income. These measures should not be considered substitutes for their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. See Non-GAAP Reconciliations\u201d section included herein for reconciliation of these amounts.\nItems or Events Impacting Comparability\nRefer to the Non-GAAP Measures\u201d section above for discussion of the changes made during the fourth quarter of 2018 to the Company's definition of certain non-GAAP measures.\nPetroleum Segment\nStarting with the fourth quarter of 2018, derivative gains or losses are now presented within Cost of Materials and Other. Prior period amounts have been conformed to the current presentation.\nCoffeyville Refinery - During the first quarter of 2018, our Coffeyville, Kansas refinery (the Coffeyville Refinery\u201d) experienced an outage with its fluid catalytic cracking unit ( FCC\u201d) lasting 48 days. The FCC outage had a significant negative impact on production and sales during that period.\nWynnewood Refinery - During 2017, the Wynnewood, Oklahoma ( Wynnewood Refinery\u201d) underwent a turnaround on its hydrocracking unit in the first quarter of 2017 at a cost of $13 million and the first phase of its planned facility turnaround, with the second phase scheduled for the first quarter of 2019, at a cost of approximately $67 million, including $43 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNitrogen Fertilizer Segment\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, the Partnership recognized a $6 million business interruption insurance recovery associated with an outage at its Coffeyville, Kansas facility (the Coffeyville Facility\u201d) during 2017. The recovery is recorded in the Other Income (Expense) line item. Prior year amounts, which were not material, were conformed to the current year presentation.\nCoffeyville Facility - During 2018, our Coffeyville, Kansas nitrogen fertilizer facility (the Coffeyville Facility\u201d) had a planned, full facility turnaround lasting 15 days and incurred approximately $6 million in turnaround expense in the second quarter of 2018. During 2017, the Coffeyville Facility's third-party air separation unit experienced a shut down. Paired with this shut down and subsequent operational challenges, the Coffeyville Facility experienced unplanned UAN downtime of 11 days during the second quarter of 2017.\nEast Dubuque Facility - During 2017, our East Dubuque, Illinois nitrogen fertilizer facility (the East Dubuque Facility\u201d) had a planned, full facility turnaround lasting 14 days and incurred approximately $3 million in turnaround expense in the third quarter of 2017. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2017, the East Dubuque Facility experienced unplanned downtime totaling 12 days.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 53\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated\nThe following sections should be read in conjunction with the information outlined in the previous sections of this Item 7 and the financial statements and related notes thereto in Item 8. Our consolidated results of operations include certain other unallocated corporate activities and the elimination of intercompany transactions and therefore do not equal the sum of the operating results of the petroleum and nitrogen fertilizer segments.\nConsolidated Financial Highlights\n_______________________________________\n(1) See Non-GAAP Reconciliations\u201d section below for reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures shown above.\nOperating Income (Loss) by Segment\n\nDecember 31, 2018 | 54\nEBITDA by Segment (1)\n\n_______________________________________\n(1) See Non-GAAP Reconciliations\u201d section below for reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures shown above.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nOverview - Net income attributable to CVR Energy increased by $54 million, or $0.42 per share, from 2017 to 2018 due to significantly improved segment market conditions and operations during 2018 which contributed $479 million of additional operating income year-over-year. These results were offset by an increase in tax expense of $306 million and $140 million in higher earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest given the better results at our business segments. Refer to our detailed discussion of the Petroleum and Nitrogen Fertilizer Segments contained in this section.\nIncome Taxes - In December 2017, we recognized a $201 million tax benefit associated with the remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities upon the enactment of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d), resulting in a total tax benefit of $217 million for 2017. In 2018, we recognized $89 million in tax expense for an effective tax rate of 17.8%. Our effective tax rate was lower than prior years due to the reduction in statutory tax rate as part of the Tax Act.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nOverview - Net income attributable to CVR Energy increased by $210 million, or $2.42 per share, from 2016 to 2017 due to improved operating income driven primarily by an increase of $76 million in the Petroleum Segment offset by a decrease of $36 million in the Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment. The net operational improvement was further aided by an increased tax benefit of $197 million while being offset by $26 million in increased interest costs. Refer to our detailed discussion of the Petroleum and Nitrogen Fertilizer Segments contained in this section.\nInterest Expense - Our 2017 results included $26 million in additional interest costs compared to 2016 due to the full year of interest on the debt incurred for the acquisition of our East Dubuque Fertilizer Facility in April 2016.\nIncome Taxes - In December 2017, we recognized a $200 million benefit associated with the remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities upon the enactment of the Tax Act. No such benefit was recognized in 2016.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 55\nPetroleum Segment\nRefining Throughput and Production Data by Refinery\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2018, management revised its internal and external approach to calculating refinery throughput and production data to include ethanol and biodiesel consumed at the refineries. We believe this revised calculation of refinery throughput and production data is appropriate as it conveys more accurate data reflecting each refinery's operational performance for the period. Prior year balances have been conformed with the current year calculation. The adjustments to the calculation of refinery throughput and production had an immaterial impact on the data presented.\n\n\n\nDecember 31, 2018 | 56\nFinancial Highlights\nDecember 31, 2018 | 57\n_____________________________\n(1) See Non-GAAP Reconciliations\u201d section below for reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures shown above.\nPetroleum Operating Results\n\n_______________________________________\n(1) See Non-GAAP Reconciliations\u201d section below for reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures shown above.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nOverview - The Petroleum Segment's operating results for 2018 compared to 2017 increased due primarily to a significant increase in our refining margin on a total throughput barrel basis. Additionally, turnaround expenses totaled $80 million in 2017 for activities at our Wynnewood Refinery compared to $4 million in 2018 which relate to costs incurred in planning for the Wynnewood Refinery next turnaround in the first quarter of 2019.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 58\nRefining Margin - For the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, refining margin increased significantly on a per total throughput barrel basis largely due to the increase in crack spreads and crude differentials realized during the period. The NYMEX 2-1-1 crack spread increased by $1.23 per barrel, primarily due to an improved distillate crack of $4.22 offset by a decrease in the gasoline crack of $1.77. The Group 3 2-1-1 also improved in 2018 by $1.60 compared to the same period last year, again driven largely by an increase in the distillate crack of $4.74 offset by a decrease in the gasoline crack of $1.52. Given our significant distillate production, we were able realize enhanced capture rates on the NYMEX and Group 3 crack spreads in 2018. Additionally, to our benefit in 2018, crude differentials were significantly higher in 2018 than in 2017. WCS and Midland crude supply availability and take-away constraints widened the discounts to WTI to $26.38 and $7.36 per barrel, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018, respectively, compared to $12.69 and $0.34, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017. In addition, refining margins benefited from a reduction in RFS compliance costs of $189 million driven by the significant price decline in RINs throughout 2018.\nDirect Operating Expenses - Direct operating expenses, excluding turnaround expenses, increased slightly due to lower throughput in 2018 compared to 2017. Our 2018 throughput rates were negatively impacted by the FCCU outage at the Coffeyville Refinery during the first quarter of 2018.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nOverview - The Petroleum Segment's operating results for 2017 compared to 2016 increased due to an increase in our refining margin on a total throughput barrel basis. This increase was offset by turnaround expenses totaling $80 million in 2017 for activities at the Wynnewood Refinery compared to $31 million in 2016 which relate to costs incurred at the Coffeyville Refinery.\nRefining Margin - Our refining margin per barrel of total throughput increased to $9.92 for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $8.47 for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to the improvement in product margins. The benchmark 2-1-1 crack spread improved to $18.19 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $14.66 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2016. Also contributing to the increase in refining margin and 2-1-1 crack spread per barrel was the improvement in the Group 3 gasoline basis to NYMEX gasoline to ($1.83) per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to ($3.62) per barrel in the comparable period in 2016. The per barrel improvement from 2016 to 2017 was offset by increased throughput in 2017. Additionally, the Petroleum Segment incurred an additional $43 million in RFS compliance costs due primarily to unfavorable RINs pricing observed in 2017 compared to 2016.\nNitrogen Fertilizer Segment\nUtilization - The following tables summarize the ammonia utilization at the Coffeyville and East Dubuque facilities. Utilization is an important measure used by management to assess operational output at each of the Partnership's facilities. Utilization is calculated as actual tons produced divided by capacity.\nThe Partnership presents our utilization on a two-year rolling average to take into account the impact of our current turnaround cycles on any specific period. The two-year rolling average is a more useful presentation of the long-term utilization performance of Nitrogen Fertilizer segment's plants.\nThe Partnership present utilization solely on ammonia production rather than each nitrogen product as it provides a comparative baseline against industry peers and eliminates the disparity of plant configurations for upgrade of ammonia into other nitrogen products. With efforts primarily focused on Ammonia upgrade capabilities, this measure is the most meaningful in terms of management success in operations.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 59\nSales and Pricing per Ton - Two of the Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment's key operating metrics are total sales for ammonia and UAN along with the product pricing per ton realized at the gate. Product pricing at gate represents net sales less freight revenue divided by product sales volume in tons and is shown in order to provide a pricing measure that is comparable across the fertilizer industry.\nProduction Volumes - Gross tons produced for ammonia represent the total ammonia produced, including ammonia produced that was upgraded into other fertilizer products. Net tons available for sale represent the ammonia available for sale that was not upgraded into other fertilizer products.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 60\n\nFeedstock. Our Coffeyville Facility utilizes a pet coke gasification process to produce nitrogen fertilizer. Our East Dubuque Facility uses natural gas in its production of ammonia.\n\n_______________________________________\n (1) The feedstock natural gas shown above does not include natural gas used for fuel. The cost of fuel natural gas is included in direct operating expense (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). \nDecember 31, 2018 | 61\nFinancial Highlights\nThe results of operations from the East Dubuque Merger are included for the post-acquisition period beginning April 1, 2016.\n_______________________________________\n(1) See Non-GAAP Reconciliations\u201d section below for reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures shown above.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nNet Sales - Nitrogen Fertilizer net sales increased by $20 million to $351 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was benefited primarily from favorable pricing conditions in the second half of 2018 which contributed $37 million in higher revenues. These price increases were offset by $18 million in volume reductions in 2018 as compared to 2017.\nThe following table demonstrates the impact of changes in sales volumes and pricing for the primary components of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017:\n\nThe increase in UAN sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to higher production resulting from less planned and unplanned downtime and a larger amount of product available in inventory as of December 31, 2017. The decrease in ammonia sales volumes for 2018 compared to 2017 was partly attributable to more product being left available for sale as of December 31, 2018 due to a comparatively weaker fall 2018 application as compared to in 2017. Weather was also a significant factor contributing to the decrease in ammonia sales volumes. As a result of a wetter than expected fall season, customers were unable to apply ammonia, resulting in certain customers canceling ammonia contracts for delivery in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 62\nOperating Income (Loss) - For 2018, operating income was $6 million compared to a loss of $10 million in 2017. The $16 million increase in operating income in 2018 is driven by improved market conditions discussed above. The net sales increase was offset by increased feedstock costs, due to higher pet coke, and purchased ammonia prices and higher direct operating expenses driven by an increase of $3 million in turnaround expenses year-over-year. During 2018, our Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility used 5% less pet coke. The facility's cost of pet coke increased due to a higher proportion of pet coke being purchased from third parties at higher prices. The percentage of pet coke obtained from third parties increased from 34% for the year ended December 31, 2017 to 41% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The price for per coke purchased increased by 51% and 56%, respectively, year-over-year, with third party coke increasing from $37 to $56 per ton and internally produced coke increasing from $6 to $10 per ton. Direct operating expenses were higher due to $6 million being spent on the Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility's 2018 turnaround compared to $3 million on the East Dubuque Facility's 2017 turnaround.\nNet Loss - The Nitrogen Fertilizer segment net loss of $50 million decreased significantly as compared to 2017 due to the operational and market improvements discussed above. Additionally, in December 2018, the Nitrogen Fertilizer segment recognized a business interruption insurance recovery of $6 million related to outages at our Coffeyville Facility in 2017 and 2018.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nNet Sales - The Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment's net sales were $331 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $356 million for 2016. The decrease of $25 million was attributable to negative impacts from weaker market conditions. Changes in ammonia and UAN volume did not have a material impact on net sales. The following table demonstrates the impact of changes in sales volumes and pricing for the primary components of net sales for 2017 as compared to 2016:\n\nOperating Income (Loss) - For 2017, operating income decreased by $36 million as compared to 2016 to a loss of $10 million. The significant decrease in operating income is primarily due to the unfavorable pricing conditions experienced in 2017. Also contributing in 2017 was an increase of $16 million in depreciation and amortization expense primarily driven by the full year of depreciation recognized in 2017 associated with East Dubuque Fertilizer Facility in April 2016. These increased costs were offset by lower turnaround expense of $4 million year-over-year .\nNet Loss - The Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment's net loss of $73 million in 2017 increased significantly compared to 2016 due to the operational and market conditions and operational expenses incurred in 2017. Additionally, in 2017, an increase of $14 million in interest expense occurred due to a full year of interest on the long-term debt obtained as part of the East Dubuque Facility acquisition in April 2016.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 63\nNon-GAAP Reconciliations\nReconciliation of Net Income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\n\n_____________________________\n (1) Represents a loss on extinguishment of debt incurred by CVR Partners in June 2016 in connection with the repurchase of senior notes assumed in the East Dubuque Merger. \n (2) Represents legal and other professional fees and other merger related expenses associated with the East Dubuque Merger. \nReconciliation of Income (Loss) before Income Tax Expense (Benefit) to Adjusted Net Income\n\nDecember 31, 2018 | 64\nReconciliation of Petroleum Segment Net Income to Petroleum EBITDA and Petroleum Adjusted EBITDA\n\n_______________________________________\n(1)Represents expense associated with turnaround activities at the Coffeyville and Wynnewood Refineries.\nReconciliation of Petroleum Segment Gross Profit to Refining Margin\n\n_______________________________________\n(1)Represents expense associated with turnaround activities at the Coffeyville and Wynnewood Refineries.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 65\nReconciliation of Refining Margin and Refining Margin per Total Throughput Barrel\n\n\n\nReconciliation of Petroleum Direct Operating Expenses and Direct Operating Expenses, excluding Turnaround Expenses, per Total Throughput Barrel\n\n_______________________________________\n(1)Represents expense associated with turnaround activities at the Coffeyville and Wynnewood Refineries.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 66\nReconciliation of Nitrogen Fertilizer Net Loss to Nitrogen Fertilizer EBITDA and Nitrogen Fertilizer Adjusted EBITDA\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal source of liquidity has historically been cash from operations. Our principal uses of cash are for working capital, capital expenditures, funding our debt service obligations and paying dividends to our stockholders, as further discussed below.\nWe believe that our cash from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents, along with borrowings, as necessary, under the AB Credit Facility ( AB Credit Facility\u201d) and Amended ABL Credit Facility ( Amended ABL Credit Facility\u201d), will be sufficient to satisfy anticipated cash requirements associated with our existing operations for at least the next 12 months, and that we have sufficient cash resources to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. However, our future capital expenditures and other cash requirements could be higher than we currently expect as a result of various factors. Additionally, our ability to generate sufficient cash from our operating activities and secure additional financing depends on our future performance, which is subject to general economic, political, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control.\nDepending on the needs of our business, contractual limitations and market conditions, we may from time to time seek to issue equity securities, incur additional debt, issue debt securities, or otherwise refinance our existing debt. There can be no assurance that we will seek to do any of the foregoing or that we will be able to do any of the foregoing on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nCash Balances and Other Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had consolidated cash and cash equivalents of $668 million, $394 million available under CVR Refining's Amended ABL Credit Facility and $50 million available under CVR Partners' Asset Based Credit Facility.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 67\n\nAmended ABL Credit Facility - On November 14, 2017, Coffeyville Resources LLC ( CRLLC\u201d), CVR Refining, CVR Refining LLC ( Refining LLC\u201d) and each of the operating subsidiaries of Refining LLC (collectively, the Credit Parties\u201d) entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Amended and Restated ABL Credit Agreement (the Amendment\u201d) with a group of lenders and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ( Wells Fargo\u201d), as administrative agent and collateral agent. The Amendment amends certain provisions of the Amended and Restated ABL Credit Agreement, dated December 20, 2012, by and among Wells Fargo, the group of lenders party thereto and the Credit Parties (the Existing Credit Agreement\u201d and as amended by the Amendment, the Amended and Restated ABL Credit Facility\u201d), which was otherwise scheduled to mature in December 2017. The Amended and Restated ABL Credit Facility is a $400 million asset-based revolving credit facility, with sub-limits for letters of credit and swingline loans of $60 million and $40 million, respectively. The Amended and Restated ABL Credit Facility also includes a $200 million uncommitted incremental facility. The proceeds of the loans may be used for capital expenditures, working capital and general corporate purposes. The Amended and Restated Credit Facility matures in November 2022.\nAB Credit Facility - The Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment has an AB Credit Facility, the proceeds of which may be used to fund working capital and other general corporate purposes. The AB Credit Facility is a senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility with an aggregate principal amount of availability of up to $50.0 million with an incremental facility, which permits an increase in borrowings of up to $25.0 million in the aggregate subject to additional lender commitments and certain other conditions. The AB Credit Facility matures in September 2021. CVR Partners was in compliance with all applicable covenants as of December 31, 2018.\n2023 Notes - CVR Partners issued $645 million aggregate principal amount of 9.250% Senior Secured Notes due 2023 (the 2023 Notes\u201d) in 2016. The 2023 Notes are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by all of the Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment's existing subsidiaries. At any time prior to June 15, 2019, we may on any of one or more occasions redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes issued under the indenture governing the 2023 Notes in an amount not greater than the net proceeds of one or more public equity offerings at a redemption price of 109.250% of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. Prior to June 15, 2019, we may on any one or more occasions redeem all or part of the 2023 Notes at a redemption price equal to the sum of: (i) the principal amount thereof, plus (ii) the make whole premium, as defined in the indenture (the 2023 Indenture\u201d) governing the 2023 Notes, at the redemption date, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the applicable redemption date.\nUpon the occurrence of certain change of control events as defined in the 2023 Indenture (including the sale of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of the Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment and its subsidiaries taken as a whole), each holder of the 2023 Notes will have the right to require that the Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment repurchase all or a portion of such holder's 2023 Notes in cash at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 68\n2022 Notes - CVR Refining's $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.5% Second Lien Senior Notes due 2022 (the 2022 Notes\u201d) are unsecured and fully and unconditionally guaranteed by CVI, CVR Refining and each of Refining LLC's existing domestic subsidiaries (other than the co-issuer, Coffeyville Finance) on a joint and several basis. The 2022 Notes mature on November 1, 2022, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased by the issuers. Interest is payable on the 2022 Notes semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year, to holders of record at the close of business on April 15 and October 15, as the case may be, immediately preceding each such interest payment date.\nCredit Agreement - On January 29, 2019, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) with Jefferies Finance LLC to provide a term loan credit facility with a maturity date of March 10, 2019. The borrowings under the Credit Agreement of $105 million were used to fund a portion of the CVRR Unit Purchase. All amounts were repaid on February 11, 2019.\nCapital Spending\nWe divide capital spending needs into two categories: maintenance and growth. Maintenance capital spending includes non-discretionary maintenance projects and projects required to comply with environmental, health and safety regulations. Growth capital projects generally involve an expansion of existing capacity and/or a reduction in direct operating expenses. We undertake growth capital spending based on the expected return on incremental capital employed.\nOur total capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2018 along with our estimated expenditures for 2019, by segment, are as follows:\n\n_____________________________\n (1) Total 2019 estimated capital expenditures includes approximately $50 to 60 million of growth related projects that will require additional approvals before commencement. \nOur estimated capital expenditures are subject to change due to unanticipated changes in the cost, scope and completion time for capital projects. For example, we may experience increases/decreases in labor or equipment costs necessary to comply with government regulations or to complete projects that sustain or improve the profitability of the refineries or nitrogen fertilizer plants. We may also accelerate or defer some capital expenditures from time to time. Capital spending for CVR Partners is determined by the board of directors of its general partner.\nDividends to CVR Energy Stockholders\nThe Company has a dividend policy. Dividends are subject to change at the discretion of the board of directors. On February 20, 2019, the Company's board of directors declared a cash dividend for the fourth quarter of 2018 to the Company's stockholders of $0.75 per share, or $75 million in the aggregate. The dividend will be paid on March 11, 2019 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 4, 2019.\nDistributions to Unitholders\nFor the fourth quarter of 2018, the CVR Partners, upon approval by its general partner's board of directors on February 20, 2019, declared a distribution of $0.12 per common unit, or $14 million, payable on March 11, 2019 to unitholders of record as of March 4, 2019. Of this amount, we will receive approximately $5 million with remaining amount payable to public unitholders.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 69\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated cash flows for the periods indicated below:\n\nOperating Activities\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 were approximately $620 million compared to $168 million in 2017. The increase of $452 million as due to the improved operating results from our business as illustrated by the increase of $492 million in EBITDA from 2017 to 2018. This increase was offset by changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities during 2018.\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $99 million from $267 million in 2016. This decrease was the result of significant cash expenditures to purchase RINs for the Petroleum Segment's RFS compliance which more than offset an increase in EBITDA of $58 million year-over-year.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $100 million compared to $196 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease as compared to the prior year is largely a result of the prior year $76 million investment in a Midway Pipeline, LLC ( Midway\u201d) joint venture along with lower capital expenditures in 2018.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $196 million compared to $201 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease of $5 million of cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the net $64 million of cash paid in 2016 for the acquisition of the East Dubuque Fertilizer Facility and $13 million in lower capital expenditures in 2017 compared to 2016. These decreases from 2016 to 2017 were offset by the investment in the Midway joint venture in 2017.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $334 million, as compared to $226 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to dividend payments to common stockholders of $238 million and distributions to CVR Refining common unitholders of $93 million. The increase as compared to the prior year is largely a result of higher dividend and distribution payments being made in the current year by both CVR Energy and CVR Refining.\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $226 million compared to $95 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Dividend payments of $174 million to our common stockholders and distributions of $47 million and $2 million to CVR Refining and CVR Partners common unitholders, respectively, were consistent year-over-year. The increase in net cash used in financing activities of $131 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to the $133 million net proceeds received in 2016 from CVR Partners' issuance of 2023 Notes net of debt repayments in connection with the East Dubuque Fertilizer Facility acquisition.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 70\nLong-Term Commitments\nIn addition to long-term debt, we are required to make payments relating to various types of obligations. The following table summarizes our minimum payments as of December 31, 2018 relating to contractual obligations and other commercial commitments for the five-year period following December 31, 2018 and thereafter.\n\n_______________________________________\n (1) Consists of the 2021 Notes, the 2022 Notes and the 2023 Notes as of December 31, 2018. \n (2) CVR Refining and CVR Partners lease various facilities and equipment. \n (3) The amount includes commitments under capital lease arrangements for three leases which include a pipeline lease, a storage and terminal equipment lease and a bundled truck lease. \n (4) The amount includes (i) commitments for petroleum products storage and petroleum transportation, (ii) electricity supply agreement, (iii) a product supply agreement, (iv) a pet coke supply agreement, (v) commitments related to our biofuels blending obligation and (vi) various agreements for gas and gas transportation. \n (5) Interest payments for our long-term debt outstanding and capital lease obligations as of December 31, 2018 and commitment fees on the unutilized commitments of the ABL Credit Facility. \n (6) The amount includes environmental liabilities and a standby letter of credit.

Energy. The document mentions key components that would be useful in assessment and is intended to be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes. It contains discussions on key strategies and goals, mission and values, strategic objectives, achievements, and industry factors. \n\nThe company's mission is to be a leading North American petroleum refining and nitrogen-based fertilizer company, adhering to core values like safety, environment, integrity, corporate citizenship, and continuous improvement. \n\nStrategic objectives are outlined to improve safety, reliability, market capture, and financial discipline. \n\nNotable achievements in line with the strategic objectives include significant year-over-year improvement in environmental, health, and safety at all plants, consolidation of certain back office locations to reduce administrative costs, and increased throughput of regional crudes and condensate. \n\nFactors affecting the petroleum segment are discussed in detail, including relationships between product prices and crude oil prices, market conditions, regulatory effects, and demand influenced by economic, political, and geographic factors. Similarly, nitrogen fertilizer segment earnings and cash flows are considered, taking into account global supply and demand, grain production levels, population changes, transportation infrastructure costs, and government intervention in agricultural markets. \n\nCapital expenditures and financial discipline, including strategies for efficient operation and prudent capital deployment, are also discussed.\n\nNon-GAAP measures are used to evaluate performance with adjustments made for a clearer understanding of operational results and profitability. These adjustments include reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA for the interpretation of financial results without the impact of certain non-recurring items.\n\nThe document also discusses the impacts on comparability due to changes in non-GAAP measures definitions and the presentation of operating income by segment.\n\nLastly, the report describes liquidity and capital resources, highlighting cash balances and other liquidity information, capital spending requirements categorized into maintenance and growth, dividends to stockholders, distributions to unitholders, cash flows, contractual obligations and commitments, and mentions off-balance sheet arrangements. Critical accounting policies that could materially affect the financial statements are mentioned, including goodwill impairment, income taxes, impairment of long-lived assets, and derivative instruments. These are necessary for preparing the consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nOverall, this section of the report provides an in-depth discussion of the company's financial condition, results of operations, and future objectives based on past performance and planned strategies."}
