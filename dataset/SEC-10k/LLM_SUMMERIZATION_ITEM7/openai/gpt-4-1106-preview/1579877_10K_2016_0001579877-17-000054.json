Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d This MD&A contains forward-looking statements that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. The forward-looking statements are subject to a number of important factors, including, but not limited to, those factors discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results described herein or implied by such forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nOUTFRONT Media is a real estate investment trust ( REIT\u201d), which provides advertising space ( displays\u201d) on out-of-home advertising structures and sites in the United States (the U.S.\u201d) and Canada. We currently manage our operations through three operating segments-(1) U.S. Billboard and Transit, which is included in our U.S. Media reportable segment, (2) International and (3) Sports Marketing. International and Sports Marketing do not meet the criteria to be a reportable segment and accordingly, are both included in Other (see Item 8., Note 18. Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Prior to April 1, 2016, our International segment included our advertising businesses in Canada and Latin America.\nOn April 1, 2016, we sold all of our equity interests in certain of our subsidiaries (the Disposition\u201d), which held all of the assets of our outdoor advertising business in Latin America. (See Item 8., Note 12. Acquisitions and Dispositions: Dispositions to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) The operating results of our outdoor advertising business in Latin America through April 1, 2016, are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements for 2016, 2015 and 2014, and are included in Other in our segment reporting.\nBusiness\nWe are one of the largest providers of advertising space on out-of-home advertising structures and sites across the U.S. and Canada. Our inventory consists of billboard displays, which are primarily located on the most heavily traveled highways and roadways in top Nielsen Designated Market Areas ( DMAs\u201d), and transit advertising displays operated under exclusive multi-year contracts with municipalities in large cities across the U.S. and Canada. We also have marketing and multimedia rights agreements with colleges, universities and other educational institutions, which entitle us to to operate on-campus advertising displays, as well as manage marketing opportunities, media rights and experiential entertainment at sports events. In total, we have displays in all of the 25 largest markets in the U.S. and over 150 markets in the U.S. and Canada. Our top market, high profile location focused portfolio includes sites such as the Bay Bridge in San Francisco, various locations along Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, and sites in and around both Grand Central Station and Times Square in New York. The breadth and depth of our portfolio provides our customers with a range of options to address their marketing objectives, from national, brand-building campaigns to hyper-local campaigns that drive customers to the advertiser's website or retail location one mile down the road.\u201d\nUsing Geopath Out of Home Ratings, the out-of-home advertising industry's audience measurement system, we provide advertisers with the size and demographic composition of the audience that is exposed to individual displays or a complete campaign. As part of our ON Smart Media technology development initiative, we are developing hardware and software solutions for enhanced demographic and location targeting, and engaging ways to connect with consumers on-the-go. Additionally, our OUTFRONT Mobile Network allows our customers to further leverage location targeting with interactive mobile advertising that uses geofence technology to push mobile ads to consumers within a pre-defined radius around a corresponding billboard display or other designated advertising location.\nWe believe out-of-home advertising continues to be an attractive form of advertising, as our displays are ALWAYS ON\u2122, are always viewable and cannot be turned off, skipped, blocked or fast-forwarded. Further, out-of-home advertising can be an effective stand-alone\u201d medium, as well as an integral part of a campaign to reach audiences using multiple forms of media, including television, radio, print, online, mobile and social media advertising platforms. We provide our customers with a differentiated advertising solution at an attractive price point relative to other forms of advertising. In addition to leasing displays, we provide other value-added services to our customers, such as pre-campaign category research, consumer insights, creative design support, print production and post-campaign tracking and analytics, as well as use of a real-time mobile operations reporting system that facilitates proof of performance to customers for substantially all of our business.\nU.S. Media. Our U.S. Media segment generated 25% of its revenues in the New York City metropolitan area in 2016, 27% in 2015 and 23% in 2014, and generated 16% in the Los Angeles metropolitan area in 2016, 15% in 2015, and 13% in 2014. Our U.S. Media segment generated Revenues of $1.39 billion in 2016, $1.34 billion in 2015 and $1.16 billion in 2014, and Operating income before Depreciation, Amortization, Net (gain) loss on dispositions, Stock-based compensation, Restructuring charges, Loss on real estate assets held for sale and Acquisition costs ( Adjusted OIBDA\u201d) of $473.8 million in 2016, $451.1 million in 2015 and $409.2 million in 2014. (See the Segment Results of Operations\u201d section of this MD&A.)\nOther (includes International and Sports Marketing). Other generated Revenues of $120.1 million in 2016, $169.5 million in 2015 and $191.3 million in 2014, and Adjusted OIBDA of $17.8 million in 2016, $24.3 million in 2015, and $31.3 million in 2014.\nEconomic Environment\nOur revenues and operating results are sensitive to fluctuations in advertising expenditures, general economic conditions and other external events beyond our control.\nBusiness Environment\nThe outdoor advertising industry is fragmented, consisting of several companies operating on a national basis, as well as hundreds of smaller regional and local companies operating a limited number of displays in a single or a few local geographic markets. We compete with these companies for customers, structures and display locations. We also compete with other media, including online, mobile and social media advertising platforms and traditional platforms such as, broadcast and cable television, radio, print media and direct mail marketers. Increasing the number of digital billboard displays in our most heavily trafficked locations is an important element of our organic growth strategy, as digital billboard displays have the potential to attract additional business from both new and existing customers. We believe digital billboard displays are attractive to our customers because they allow for the development of richer and more visually engaging messages, provide our customers with the flexibility both to target audiences by time of day and to quickly launch new advertising campaigns, and eliminate or greatly reduce production costs. In addition, digital billboard displays enable us to run multiple advertisements on each display (up to eight per minute). As a result, digital billboard displays generate approximately four times more revenue per display on average than traditional static billboard displays, and digital billboard displays generate higher profits and cash flows than traditional static billboard displays.\nOur revenues and profits may fluctuate due to seasonal advertising patterns and influences on advertising markets. Typically, our revenues and profits are highest in the fourth quarter, during the holiday shopping season, and lowest in the first quarter, as advertisers cut back on spending following the holiday shopping season.\nWe have a diversified base of customers across various industries. During 2016, our largest categories of advertisers were retail, television and healthcare/pharmaceuticals, which represented 9%, 8% and 7% of our total U.S. Media segment revenues, respectively. During 2015, our largest categories of advertisers were retail, television and healthcare/pharmaceuticals, which represented 9%, 9% and 7% of our total U.S. Media segment revenues, respectively. During 2014, our largest categories of advertisers were retail, television and healthcare/pharmaceuticals, which represented 10%, 9% and 8% of our total U.S. Media segment revenues, respectively.\nOur large-scale portfolio allows our customers to reach a national audience and also provides the flexibility to tailor campaigns to specific regions or markets. In 2016, we generated approximately 45% of our U.S. Media segment revenues from national advertising campaigns, compared to 47% in 2015 and 41% in 2014. The increase in revenues from national advertising campaigns in 2016 and 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily due to the impact of the acquisition of certain outdoor advertising businesses of Van Wagner Communications, LLC (the Acquisition\u201d) on October 1, 2014.\nOur transit businesses require us to obtain and renew contracts with municipalities and other governmental entities. When these contracts expire, we generally must participate in highly competitive bidding processes in order to obtain new contracts. In November 2014, we were informed that we were not successful in the renewal of the New York City phone kiosk contract which we obtained as part of the Acquisition and our operation of these kiosks ceased during the first quarter of 2015. In 2015, we generated revenue of $1.6 million related to these operations.\nOur transit contracts with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (the MTA\u201d) represent $225.1 million in revenues, representing 58% of our U.S. Media segment transit and other revenues or 18% of our total U.S. Media segment revenues in 2016. The MTA has issued a Request for Proposals\u201d to prospective operators for the subway, bus and commuter rail (Metro-\nNorth and Long Island Railroad) concessions, in any combination, each for a ten-year contract, with an additional potential five-year renewal period. On May 18, 2016, we submitted a response to the MTA. In mid-October, the MTA issued a follow-up request that refined its timeline and bid requirements, particularly relating to digital deployment and the communications platform and we submitted our response on December 12, 2016. On November 7, 2016, we entered into an agreement with the MTA to extend the expiration of our existing contracts for transit advertising services from December 31, 2016, to June 30, 2017, unless earlier terminated by the MTA on 90 days' notice. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business and Operations-The success of our transit advertising business is dependent on obtaining and renewing key municipal contracts on favorable terms.\u201d)\nKey Performance Indicators\nOur management reviews our performance by focusing on the indicators described below.\nSeveral of our key performance indicators are not prepared in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). We believe these non-GAAP performance indicators are meaningful supplemental measures of our operating performance and should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,513.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,513.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Organic revenues(a)(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,492.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,446.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>204.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>137\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted OIBDA(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>449.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>437.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funds from operations ( FFO\u201d)(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>280.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>272.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted FFO ( AFFO\u201d)(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>294.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>268.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Calculation not meaningful.\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Organic revenues exclude revenues associated with significant acquisitions and divestitures, revenues associated with business lines we no longer operate, and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates ( non-organic revenues\u201d). We provide organic revenues to understand the underlying growth rate of revenue excluding the impact of non-organic revenue items. Our management believes organic revenues are useful to users of our financial data because it enables them to better understand the level of growth of our business period to period. Since organic revenues are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, it should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, revenues as an indicator of operating performance. Organic revenues, as we calculate it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(b)\n</td> <td>See the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d and Revenues\u201d sections of this MD&A for reconciliations of Operating income to Adjusted OIBDA, Net income (loss) to FFO and AFFO and Revenues to organic revenues.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted OIBDA\nWe calculate Adjusted OIBDA as Operating income (loss) before Depreciation, Amortization, Net (gain) loss on dispositions, Stock-based compensation, Restructuring charges, Loss on real estate assets held for sale and Acquisition costs. We calculate Adjusted OIBDA margin by dividing Adjusted OIBDA by total revenues. Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA margin are among the primary measures we use for managing our business, evaluating our operating performance and planning and forecasting future periods, as each is an important indicator of our operational strength and business performance. Our management believes users of our financial data are best served if the information that is made available to them allows them to align their analysis and evaluation of our operating results along the same lines that our management uses in managing, planning and executing our business strategy. Our management also believes that the presentations of Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA margin, as supplemental measures, are useful in evaluating our business because eliminating certain non-comparable items highlight operational trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. It is management's opinion that these supplemental measures provide users of our financial data with an important perspective on our operating performance and also make it easier for users of our financial data to compare our results with other companies that have different financing and capital structures or tax rates.\nFFO and AFFO\nWe calculate FFO in accordance with the definition established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d). FFO reflects net income (loss) adjusted to exclude gains and losses from the sale of real estate assets, depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, amortization of direct lease acquisition costs, the non-cash effect of loss on\nreal estate assets held for sale and the same adjustments for our equity-based investments, as well as the related income tax effect of adjustments, as applicable. We calculate AFFO as FFO adjusted to include cash paid for direct lease acquisition costs as such costs are generally amortized over a period ranging from four weeks to one year and therefore are incurred on a regular basis. AFFO also includes cash paid for maintenance capital expenditures since these are routine uses of cash that are necessary for our operations. In addition, AFFO excludes costs related to the Acquisition and restructuring charges, as well as certain non-cash items, including non-real estate depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, accretion expense, the non-cash effect of straight-line rent and amortization of deferred financing costs, and the non-cash portion of income taxes, as well as the related income tax effect of adjustments, as applicable. Our calculation of AFFO was revised in 2016 to adjust for the non-cash portion of income taxes instead of adjusting for current or deferred income taxes, as management believes that this calculation of AFFO is more consistent with AFFO presented by other REITs and analyzed by users of our financial data. This change is reflected in the calculation of AFFO for 2015. We use FFO and AFFO measures for managing our business and for planning and forecasting future periods, and each is an important indicator of our operational strength and business performance, especially compared to other REITs. Our management believes users of our financial data are best served if the information that is made available to them allows them to align their analysis and evaluation of our operating results along the same lines that our management uses in managing, planning and executing our business strategy. Our management also believes that the presentations of FFO, AFFO, and related per weighted average share amounts, as supplemental measures, are useful in evaluating our business because adjusting results to reflect items that have more bearing on the operating performance of REITs highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. It is management's opinion that these supplemental measures provide users of our financial data with an important perspective on our operating performance and also make it easier to compare our results to other companies in our industry, as well as to REITs.\nSince Adjusted OIBDA, Adjusted OIBDA margin, FFO and AFFO and, as applicable, related per weighted average share amounts, are not measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, Operating income (loss), Net income (loss), Revenues and Net income (loss) per common share for basic and diluted earnings per share, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, as indicators of operating performance. These measures, as we calculate them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition, these measures do not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and are not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe following table reconciles Operating income to Adjusted OIBDA, and Net income (loss) to FFO and AFFO.\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

increased 3% compared to 2015, primarily due to higher net income and increased amortization of direct lease acquisition costs, partially offset by a lower loss on real estate assets held for sale in 2016. AFFO in 2016 was $294.5 million, an increase of 10% compared to 2015, primarily due to higher net income, lower maintenance capital expenditures and higher stock-based compensation.\nAnalysis of Results of Operations\nRevenues\nWe derive Revenues primarily from providing advertising space to customers on our advertising structures and sites. Our contracts with customers generally cover periods ranging from four weeks to one year. Revenues from billboard displays are recognized as rental income on a straight-line basis over the contract term. Transit and other revenues are recognized as earned over the contract period. For space provided to advertisers through the use of an advertising agency whose commission is calculated based on a stated percentage of gross advertising spending, our Revenues are reported net of agency commissions.\n2016 vs. 2015\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

These expenses reflect the cost of leasing the real property on which our billboards are mounted. These lease agreements have terms varying between one month and multiple years, and usually provide renewal options. Rental expenses are comprised of a fixed monthly amount and under certain agreements, also include contingent rent, which varies based on the revenues we generate from the leased site. Property leases are generally paid in advance for periods ranging from one to twelve months. The fixed rent is expensed evenly over the contract term and the contingent rent is expensed as incurred when the related revenues are recognized.\nTransit franchise expenses. These expenses reflect costs charged by municipalities and transit operators under transit advertising contracts and are generally calculated based on a percentage of the revenues we generate under the contract, with a minimum guarantee. The costs that are determined based on a percentage of revenues are expensed as incurred when the related revenues are recognized, and the minimum guarantee is expensed over the contract term.\nPosting, maintenance and other site-related expenses. These expenses primarily reflect costs associated with posting and rotation, materials, repairs and maintenance, utilities and property taxes.\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Billboard property lease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>364.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>369.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>291.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transit franchise\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>230.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>227.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>203.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Posting, maintenance and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>222.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>236.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>230.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>818.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>833.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>726.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBillboard property lease expenses represented 34% of billboard revenues in each of 2016 and 2015, and 30% in 2014.

Billboard property lease and transit franchise expenses decreased by $1.0 million in 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease in billboard property lease expenses in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to the impact of the Disposition (a decrease of $12.2 million compared to 2015) and lost billboard leases in 2016, partially offset by increases in billboard property lease expenses in our U.S. Media segment. Excluding the impact of the Disposition in 2016, billboard property lease expenses increased 2% in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in transit franchise expenses in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to the increase in transit revenues, partially offset by the impact of the Disposition (a decrease of $3.6 million compared to 2015). Billboard property lease and transit franchise expenses increased by $101.0 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase in billboard property lease expenses in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to the Acquisition. The increase in transit franchise expenses in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to the increase in transit revenues.\nPosting, maintenance and other expenses as a percentage of Revenues were 15% in 2016, 16% in 2015 and 17% in 2014.

Excluding the impact of the Disposition, posting, maintenance and other expenses increased 1% in 2016 compared to 2015. Posting, maintenance and other expenses increased $5.6 million, or 2%, in 2015 compared to 2014, principally due to the impact of the Acquisition and higher production and installation costs, which are typically billed to the advertiser and recorded as Revenues, partially offset by a decrease in taxes, posting, materials and utilities expenses, and a favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses ( SG&A\u201d)\nSG&A expenses represented 17% of Revenues in each of 2016, 2015 and 2014. SG&A expenses increased $6.5 million, or 3%, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to increased sales and other compensation-related expenses and one-time professional fees in 2016 of $3.8 million associated with implementing initiatives to improve our cost base and pricing/yield management, partially offset by the impact of the Disposition (a decrease of $11.5 million compared to 2015), lower administrative costs and non-recurring legal expenses in 2015 of $5.2 million. Excluding the impact of the Disposition, SG&A expenses increased 7% in 2016 compared to 2015. SG&A expenses increased $34.0 million, or 15%, in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to the impact of the Acquisition, increased strategic business development expenses of $9.8 million, incremental stand-alone costs of $6.3 million and non-recurring legal expenses of $5.2 million.\nRestructuring Charges\nIn 2016, we recorded restructuring charges of $2.5 million for severance charges associated with the reorganization of our sales management and administrative functions. In 2015, we recorded restructuring charges of $2.6 million associated with the elimination of management positions and the elimination of positions in connection with the sale of assets and the consolidation of leased locations. In 2014, we recorded restructuring charges of $9.8 million associated with the reorganization of management, resulting in the departures of two executive officers. The restructuring charges in 2014 are comprised of severance charges, including stock-based compensation of $5.6 million.\nLoss on Real Estate Assets Held for Sale\nIn connection with the Disposition, the assets of our outdoor advertising business in Latin America had been classified as Assets held for sale on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as of December 31, 2015. It is required that we measure assets held for sale at the lower of their carrying value (including unrecognized foreign currency translation adjustment losses) or fair value less cost to sell. The impact of including unrecognized foreign currency translation adjustment losses in the carrying value of assets held for sale resulted in a non-cash loss on real estate assets held for sale of approximately $103.6 million in 2015. Upon completion of the Disposition in 2016, the unrecognized foreign currency translation adjustment loss was reclassified to earnings from Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.\nNet (Gain) Loss on Dispositions\nNet gain on dispositions was $1.9 million in 2016. Net loss on dispositions was $0.7 million in 2015. Net gain on dispositions in 2014 was $2.5 million and includes a gain of $0.6 million related to the divestiture of a transit shelter operation in the greater Los Angeles area.\nDepreciation\nDepreciation decreased $4.8 million, or 4%, in 2016 compared to 2015, due primarily to the impact of the Disposition, partially offset by higher depreciation associated with the increased number of digital billboards. Both digital and static billboards are depreciated over an estimated useful life of 5 years to 20 years. Depreciation increased $6.5 million, or 6%, in 2015 compared to 2014, due primarily to the impact of the Acquisition and higher depreciation associated with the increased number of digital billboards.\nAmortization\nAmortization decreased $0.1 million in 2016 compared to 2015, principally driven by lower amortization of intangible assets, partially offset by increased direct lease acquisition costs in 2016 compared to 2015. Amortization increased $20.4 million in 2015 compared to 2014, principally driven by amortization related to the intangible assets associated with the Acquisition. Amortization expense includes the amortization of direct lease acquisition costs of $38.2 million in 2016, $36.3 million in 2015 and $33.8 million in 2014. Capitalized direct lease acquisition costs were $38.0 million in 2016, $36.3 million in 2015 and $33.8 million in 2014.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense, net, was $113.8 million (including $6.4 million of deferred financing costs) in 2016, $114.8 million (including $6.3 million of deferred financing costs) in 2015 and $84.8 million (including $12.1 million of deferred financing costs) in 2014.\nBenefit (Provision) for Income Taxes\nIn 2014, as a result of our REIT conversion, substantially all Deferred income tax liabilities, net, was reversed into Net income via a non-cash benefit of approximately $235.6 million. As a result of our REIT conversion, our effective tax rate for the second half of 2014 was substantially lower than previous periods. We believe that the assumptions and estimates used to determine these tax amounts were reasonable. However, the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may not necessarily reflect our income tax expense or tax payments, or what our tax amounts would have been if we had been a stand-alone company operating as a REIT during the periods prior to July 16, 2014, when we were separated from CBS Corporation (the Separation\u201d).\nThe Provision for income taxes was $5.4 million in each of 2016 and 2015 and the Benefit for income taxes in 2014 was $206.0 million, including the reversal of $235.6 million, representing substantially all Deferred income tax liabilities, net, as a result of our REIT conversion. Excluding the Loss on real estate assets held for sale of $103.6 million in 2015 and the non-cash benefit recorded as a result of our REIT conversion in 2014, the effective income tax rate was 5.9% for 2016, 7.2% for 2015 and 30.3% for 2014. As a result of our REIT conversion, our 2016 and 2015 tax rates are substantially lower than 2014.\nNet Income (Loss)\nIn 2016, Net income was $90.9 million compared to a Net loss of $29.4 million in 2015, primarily due to the impact of the Disposition, and a Loss on real estate assets held for sale and non-recurring legal expenses in 2015, partially offset by higher sales and other compensation-related expenses and one-time professional fees in 2016 of $3.8 million associated with implementing initiatives to improve our cost base and pricing/yield management. In 2015, Net loss was $29.4 million compared to Net income of $306.9 million in 2014, primarily due to a Loss on real estate assets held for sale in 2015, the write-off of deferred taxes in 2014 in connection with our conversion to a REIT, the impact of the Acquisition on Revenues, Total expenses and Interest expense, net, increased stand-alone costs, strategic business development expenses and legal expenses, the majority of which were expected to be non-recurring, and increased interest expenses related to the Term Loan (as defined below) and the issuance of $800.0 million of senior unsecured notes on January 31, 2014, partially offset by a lower provision for income taxes as a result of our REIT conversion.\nSegment Results of Operations\nWe present Adjusted OIBDA as the primary measure of profit and loss for our operating segments in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB\u201d) guidance for segment reporting. (See the Key Performance Indicators\u201d section of this MD&A and Item 8., Note 18. Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements.)\nEffective April 1, 2016, we changed the segments that we use to review operating results and make decisions regarding segment performance and resource allocation. Given the changes in our portfolio resulting from the Disposition and recent acquisitions, we made this change to better align our segments with our business strategy. We currently manage our operations through three operating segments-(1) U.S. Billboard and Transit, which is included in our U.S. Media reportable segment, (2) International and (3) Sports Marketing. International and Sports Marketing do not meet the criteria to be a reportable segment and accordingly, are both included in Other. Our new segment reporting therefore includes U.S. Media and Other.\nThe following table presents our Revenues, Adjusted OIBDA, Operating income (loss) and Depreciation and Amortization by segment, in 2016, 2015 and 2014. Historical financial information by reportable segment has been recast to reflect the changes in segment reporting with no impact to previously reported consolidated financial statements. Prior to April 1, 2016, our International segment included our advertising businesses in Canada and Latin America (see Item 8., Note 12. Acquisitions and Dispositions: Dispositions to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Historical operating results for our advertising business in Latin America are included in Other.\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

and U.S. Media segment organic revenues increased $42.0 million, or 3%, in 2016 compared to 2015.\nNon-organic revenues primarily reflect acquisitions and dispositions, and revenues associated with business lines we no longer operate.\nTotal U.S. Media segment revenue grew in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting stronger market conditions in local advertising, an increase in average revenue per display (yield) in billboards, growth attributable to the conversion of traditional static billboard displays to digital billboard displays and the impact of an acquisition, partially offset by the impact of the disposition of billboard advertising structures in the second quarter of 2015, the loss of the New York City phone kiosk contract in the first quarter of 2015, the net impact of won and lost billboard leases and franchises in 2016, and lower advertising revenue in the first quarter of 2016 from major sports entertainment events. We generated approximately 45% in 2016 and 47% in 2015 of our U.S. Media segment revenues from national advertising campaigns.\nRevenues from U.S. Media segment billboards increased $35.8 million, or 4%, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily reflecting stronger market conditions in local advertising, an increase in average revenue per display (yield) and the conversion of traditional static billboard displays to digital billboard displays, partially offset by the impact of lost billboard leases in 2016 and the disposition of billboard advertising structures in the second quarter of 2015.\nOrganic revenues from U.S. Media segment billboards increased $33.2 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to an increase in average revenue per display (yield) and the conversion of traditional static billboard displays to digital billboard displays, partially offset by the impact of lost low-margin billboard leases in 2016.\nTransit and other revenues in the U.S. Media segment increased $13.7 million, or 4%, in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting stronger market conditions in local advertising, the net effect of won and lost franchises in 2016 and the impact of an acquisition, partially offset by lower advertising revenue in the first quarter of 2016 from major sports entertainment events.\nOrganic transit and other revenues in the U.S. Media segment increased $8.8 million, or 2%, in 2016 compared to 2015. This increase was driven by the net effect of won and lost franchises.\nU.S. Media segment operating and SG&A expenses increased $16.9 million and $9.9 million, or 2% and 6%, respectively, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to higher billboard property lease expenses, increased transit franchise expenses resulting from an increase in transit revenues, increased sales and other compensation-related expenses, increased strategic business development expenses of $3.3 million and higher professional fees of $2.4 million, partially offset by lost billboard leases in 2016 and lower administrative costs. In the U.S. Media segment, billboard property lease expenses represented 34% of billboard revenues in each of 2016 and 2015, and transit franchise expenses represented 63% of transit revenues in each of 2016 and 2015.\nU.S. Media segment Adjusted OIBDA increased $22.7 million in 2016 compared to 2015.

We generated approximately 47% in 2015 and 41% in 2014 of our U.S. Media segment revenues from national advertising campaigns. The increase in the percentages of revenues from national advertising campaigns in 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily due to the impact of the Acquisition.\nRevenues from U.S. Media segment billboards increased $131.4 million, or 16%, in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily reflecting the impact of the Acquisition, the conversion of traditional static billboard displays to digital billboard displays and an increase in production and installation revenues, partially offset by a decline in average revenue per display (yield).\nOrganic revenues from U.S. Media segment billboards increased $2.8 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to the conversion of traditional static billboard displays to digital billboard displays and production and installation revenues, partially offset by a decline in average revenue per display (yield). Sales performance in 2015 compared to 2014 was negatively impacted by proactive organizational changes in certain markets.\nTransit and other revenues in the U.S. Media segment increased $50.4 million, or 16%, in 2015 compared to 2014, reflecting the impact of the Acquisition and stronger market conditions in local and national advertising for transit that increased yield.\nOrganic revenues from U.S. Media segment transit and other increased $43.6 million, or 14%, in 2015 compared to 2014. This increase was driven by increased advertiser demand for transit displays as reflected by an increase in average revenue per display (yield).\nU.S. Media segment operating and SG&A expenses increased $119.5 million and $20.4 million, or 20% and 14%, respectively, in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to the impact of the Acquisition, higher transit franchise expenses due to the increase in transit revenues compared to the corresponding prior-year period, increased compensation-related expenses and increased strategic business development expenses.

Due to seasonal advertising patterns and influences on advertising markets, our revenues and operating income are typically highest in the fourth quarter, during the holiday shopping season, and lowest in the first quarter, as advertisers cut back on spending following the holiday shopping season. Further, some of our municipal transit contracts, as well as our marketing and multimedia rights agreements with colleges and universities, require guaranteed minimum annual payments to be paid at the beginning of the year.\nOur short-term cash requirements primarily include payments for operating leases, guaranteed minimum annual payments, capital expenditures, interest and dividends. Funding for short-term cash needs will come primarily from our cash on hand, operating cash flows and borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) or other secured credit facilities that we may establish.\nIn addition, as part of our growth strategy, we frequently evaluate strategic opportunities to acquire new businesses, assets or digital technology. Consistent with this strategy, we regularly evaluate potential acquisitions, ranging from small transactions to larger acquisitions, which transactions could be funded through cash on hand, additional borrowings, equity or other securities, or some combination thereof.\nOur long-term cash needs include principal payments on outstanding indebtedness. Funding for long-term cash needs will come from our cash on hand, operating cash flows, our ability to issue debt and equity securities, and borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility or other secured credit facilities that we may establish.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had net indebtedness of approximately $2.1 billion.\nOn February 22, 2017, we announced that our board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.36 per share on our common stock, payable on March 31, 2017, to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 10, 2017.\nDebt\nLong-term debt, net, consists of the following:\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term loan, due 2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>659.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>748.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior unsecured notes:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5.250% senior unsecured notes, due 2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>549.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>549.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5.625% senior unsecured notes, due 2024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>503.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>503.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5.875% senior unsecured notes, due 2025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>450.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>450.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total senior unsecured notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,502.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,502.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt issuance costs(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total long-term debt, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,136.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,222.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average cost of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>See Item 8., Note 3.

The discount is being amortized through Interest expense, net, on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nDuring 2016, we made aggregate discretionary payments of $90.0 million on the Term Loan.\nSenior Unsecured Notes\nAs of December 31, 2016, a discount of $0.5 million on $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 5.250% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2022, remains unamortized. The discount is being amortized through Interest expense, net, on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nAs of December 31, 2016, a premium of $3.0 million on $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 5.625% Senior Unsecured Notes, due 2024, remains unamortized. The premium is being amortized through Interest expense, net, on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nWe have a $425.0 million Revolving Credit Facility, which matures in 2019 (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d).\nAs of December 31, 2016, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nThe commitment fee based on the amount of unused commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility was $1.8 million in 2016 and $1.9 million in each of 2015 and 2014. As of December 31, 2016, we had issued letters of credit totaling approximately $31.7 million against the Revolving Credit Facility.\nDebt Covenants\nThe credit agreement dated January 31, 2014 (the Credit Agreement\u201d), governing the Term Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility, and the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes contain customary affirmative and negative covenants, subject to certain exceptions, including but not limited to those that limit the Company's and our subsidiaries' abilities to (i) pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect to the Company's or its wholly-owned subsidiary, Outfront Media Capital LLC's capital stock or make other restricted payments other than dividends or distributions necessary for us to maintain our REIT status, subject to certain conditions, and (ii) enter into agreements restricting certain subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany transfers.\nThe terms of the Credit Agreement require that, as long as any commitments remain outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, we maintain a Consolidated Net Secured Leverage Ratio, which is the ratio of (i) our consolidated secured debt (less up to $150.0 million of unrestricted cash) to (ii) our Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for the trailing four consecutive quarters, of no greater than 4.0 to 1.0. As of December 31, 2016, our Consolidated Net Secured Leverage Ratio was 1.3 to 1.0, as adjusted for the non-cash loss on real estate assets held for sale related to the Disposition and to give pro forma effect to acquisitions and dispositions, in accordance with the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement also requires that, in connection with the incurrence of certain indebtedness, we maintain a Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, which is the ratio of our consolidated total debt to our Consolidated EBITDA for the trailing four consecutive quarters, of no greater than 6.0 to 1.0. As of December 31, 2016, our Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio was 4.7 to 1.0, as adjusted for the non-cash loss on real estate assets held for sale related to the Disposition and to give pro forma effect to acquisitions and dispositions, in accordance with the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2016, we are in compliance with our debt covenants.\nLetter of Credit Facility\nEffective January 31, 2017, we completed the bifurcation process of our letter of credit facility between two institutions for administrative purposes. As of February 23, 2017, our letter of credit facilities totaled $80.0 million.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we issued letters of credit totaling approximately $68.0 million under our aggregate letter of credit facilities. The fees under the letter of credit facility in 2016, 2015 and 2014 were immaterial.\nDeferred Financing Costs\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had deferred $26.9 million in fees and expenses associated with the Term Loan, Revolving Credit Facility, letter of credit facility and our senior unsecured notes. We are amortizing the deferred fees through Interest expense, net, on the Consolidated Statement of Operations over the respective terms of the Term Loan, Revolving Credit Facility, letter of credit facility and our senior unsecured notes.\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth our cash flows in 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>287.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>293.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>262.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used for investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(36.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(62.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(798.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(41\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(92\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by (used for) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(286.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(148.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>536.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(91\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) to cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(36.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>78.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>*\n</td> <td>Calculation is not meaningful.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash provided by operating activities decreased $6.0 million in 2016 compared to 2015, due primarily to the timing of interest payments on our debt and the timing of commissions and other expense payments, partially offset by higher net income, as adjusted for non-cash items. Cash provided by operating activities increased $30.3 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to higher net income, as adjusted for non-cash items, resulting from the impact of the Acquisition and lower income taxes due to our REIT conversion. This was partially offset by an increased use of working capital driven by an increase in accounts\nreceivable and decreases in accounts payables and accrued expenses. These working capital increases were offset by lower cash paid for income taxes.\nAfter the Separation, we began operating as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Actual cash payments for income taxes were $1.2 million in 2016, $5.8 million in 2015 and $53.0 million in 2014, including payments made to CBS Corporation ( CBS\u201d).\nCash used for investing activities decreased $25.7 million in 2016 compared to 2015 and decreased $736.0 million in 2015 compared to 2014. In 2016, we completed several small acquisitions for a total purchase price of approximately $67.9 million, incurred $59.4 million in capital expenditures and received $90.6 million in proceeds from dispositions, primarily related to the Disposition. In 2015, we completed several small acquisitions for a total purchase price of approximately $12.1 million, incurred $59.2 million in capital expenditures and received $8.9 million in proceeds from dispositions, primarily related to the disposition of substantially all of our assets in Puerto Rico. In 2014, we completed the Acquisition for a total purchase price of approximately $714.2 million (including working capital adjustments), completed several smaller acquisitions for a total purchase price of approximately $19.6 million, incurred $64.2 million in capital expenditures and made an investment of $3.0 million in Videri Inc. in connection with licenses and services to be received under a development and license agreement with Videri Inc. and its affiliate, and received $4.5 million in proceeds from dispositions.\nThe following table presents our capital expenditures in 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Growth\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital expenditures increased $0.2 million in 2016 compared to 2015, driven by installation of the most current LED lighting technology to improve the quality and extend the life of our static billboards and an increase in digital display spending, partially offset by decreased expenditures related to the Disposition and the renovation of certain office facilities. Capital expenditures decreased $5.0 million, or 8%, in 2015 compared to 2014, driven by a decline in digital display spending, partially offset by increased investments in information technology and expenditures to renovate certain office facilities.\nFor the full year of 2017, we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately $65.0 million to $70.0 million, which will be used primarily for growth in digital displays, installation of the most current LED lighting technology to improve the quality and extend the life of our static billboards, billboard maintenance and to renovate certain office facilities.\nCash used for financing activities increased $137.9 million in 2016 compared 2015. Cash provided by financing activities was $536.6 million in 2014. In 2016, we paid cash dividends of $188.6 million and made discretionary payments totaling $90.0 million on the Term Loan. In 2015, we paid cash dividends $196.3 million, prepaid $50.0 million on the Term Loan and incurred debt, including a premium, of $103.8 million.

Contributions to our pension plans were $2.0 million in each of 2016 and 2015, and $1.6 million in 2014.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOur off-balance sheet commitments primarily consist of operating lease arrangements and guaranteed minimum annual payments. (See Item 8, Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our off-balance sheet commitments.)\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions.\nWe consider the following accounting policies to be the most critical as they are significant to its financial condition and results of operations, and require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in their application. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, see Item 8., Note 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGoodwill\nWe test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis on October 31 of each year and between annual tests should factors or indicators become apparent that would require an interim test. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting-unit level. We elected to perform the two-step quantitative impairment test in 2016.\nThe first step of the goodwill impairment test examines whether the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. We compute the estimated fair value of each reporting unit by adding the present value of the estimated annual cash flows over a discrete projection period to the residual value of the business at the end of the projection period. This technique requires us to use significant estimates and assumptions such as growth rates, operating margins, capital expenditures and discount rates. The estimated growth rates, operating margins and capital expenditures for the projection period are based on our internal forecasts of future performance as well as historical trends. The residual value is estimated based on a perpetual nominal growth rate, which is based on projected long-range inflation and long-term industry projections. The discount rates are determined based on the weighted average cost of capital of comparable entities. A downward revision of these assumptions would decrease the fair values of our reporting units.\nIf the fair value of a reporting unit falls below its carrying value, excluding any impacts from foreign currency translation adjustments reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Statement Financial Position in conformity with GAAP, we would then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of any non-cash impairment charge. Such a charge could have a material effect on the statement of operations and statement of financial position.\nLong-Lived Assets\nWe report long-lived assets, including billboard advertising structures, other property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. We depreciate or amortize these assets over their estimated useful lives, which generally range from five to 40 years. For billboard advertising structures, we estimate the useful lives based on the estimated economic life of the asset. Transit fixed assets are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the related contractual term. Our long-lived identifiable intangible assets primarily consist of acquired permits and leasehold agreements and franchise agreements, which grant us the right to operate out-of-home advertising structures in specified locations and the right to provide advertising displays on railroad and municipal transit properties. Our long-lived identifiable intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which is the respective life of the agreement and in some cases includes an estimation for renewals, which is based on historical experience.\nLong-lived assets subject to depreciation and amortization are also reviewed for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the long-lived asset might be impaired, by comparing the forecasted undiscounted cash flows to be generated by those assets to the carrying values of those assets. The significant assumptions we use to determine the useful lives and fair values of long-lived assets include contractual commitments, regulatory requirements, future expected cash flows and industry growth rates, as well as future salvage values.\nLong-lived assets are assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted cash flows generated by those assets to the respective asset's carrying value, excluding any impacts from foreign currency translation adjustments reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Statement Financial Position in conformity with GAAP. The amount of impairment loss, if any, will be measured by the difference between the net carrying value and the estimated fair value of the asset and recognized as a non-cash charge. Long-lived assets held for sale are required to be measured at the lower of their carrying value (including unrecognized foreign currency translation adjustment losses) or fair value less cost to sell.\nAsset Retirement Obligation\nWe record an asset retirement obligation for our estimated future legal obligation, upon termination or nonrenewal of a lease, associated with removing structures from the leased property and, when required by the contract, the cost to return the leased property to its original condition. These obligations are recorded at their present value in the period in which the liability is incurred and are capitalized as part of the related assets' carrying value. Accretion of the liability is recognized in operating expenses and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the expected useful life of the related asset. The obligation is calculated based on the assumption that all of our advertising structures will be removed within the next 50 years. The significant assumptions used in estimating the asset retirement obligation include the cost of removing the asset, the cost of remediating the leased property to its original condition where required and the timing and number of lease renewals, all of which are estimated based on historical experience.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method of accounting. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nOn July 17, 2014, we began operating as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As long as we remain qualified to be taxed as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our REIT taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify to be taxed as a REIT in any taxable year and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates and will be precluded from re-electing to be taxed as a REIT for the subsequent four taxable years following the year during which we lose our REIT qualification. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income or property, and the income of our TRSs will be subject to taxation at regular corporate rates. Our qualification to be taxed as a REIT will depend upon our ability to meet on a continuing basis, through actual investment and operating results, various complex requirements under the Code, related to, among other things, the sources of our gross income, the composition and values of our assets, our distribution levels and the diversity of ownership of our shares. We believe we are organized in conformity with these requirements and that our manner of operation will enable us to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT. (See Item 1. Business-Tax Status.\u201d)\nAs a REIT, we must distribute to our stockholders, at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain. To the extent that we satisfy the 90% distribution requirement, but distribute less than 100% of our taxable income, we will be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on the undistributed income. In addition, we would be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which our distributions in any calendar year are less than a minimum amount specified under U.S. federal income tax laws. We intend to pay regular quarterly distributions to our stockholders in an amount not less than 100% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for dividends paid).\nPrior to July 17, 2014, we were a member of CBS's consolidated tax group, and the provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and income tax payments were calculated on a separate tax return basis. These amounts may not necessarily reflect the income tax expense or tax payments that would have been reported if we had been operating as a stand-alone company, and would not reflect what our income tax expense or tax payments would have been as a REIT during the periods prior to the Separation. We believe that the assumptions and estimates used to determine these tax amounts were reasonable.\nAccounting Standards\nSee Item 8., Note 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for information about adoption of new accounting standards and recent accounting pronouncements.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d This MD&A contains forward-looking statements that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. The forward-looking statements are subject to a number of important factors, including, but not limited to, those factors discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results described herein or implied by such forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nOUTFRONT Media is a real estate investment trust ( REIT\u201d), which provides advertising space ( displays\u201d) on out-of-home advertising structures and sites in the United States (the U.S.\u201d) and Canada. We currently manage our operations through three operating segments-(1) U.S. Billboard and Transit, which is included in our U.S. Media reportable segment, (2) International and (3) Sports Marketing. International and Sports Marketing do not meet the criteria to be a reportable segment and accordingly, are both included in Other (see Item 8., Note 18. Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Prior to April 1, 2016, our International segment included our advertising businesses in Canada and Latin America.\nOn April 1, 2016, we sold all of our equity interests in certain of our subsidiaries (the Disposition\u201d), which held all of the assets of our outdoor advertising business in Latin America. (See Item 8., Note 12. Acquisitions and Dispositions: Dispositions to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) The operating results of our outdoor advertising business in Latin America through April 1, 2016, are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements for 2016, 2015 and 2014, and are included in Other in our segment reporting.\nBusiness\nWe are one of the largest providers of advertising space on out-of-home advertising structures and sites across the U.S. and Canada. Our inventory consists of billboard displays, which are primarily located on the most heavily traveled highways and roadways in top Nielsen Designated Market Areas ( DMAs\u201d), and transit advertising displays operated under exclusive multi-year contracts with municipalities in large cities across the U.S. and Canada. We also have marketing and multimedia rights agreements with colleges, universities and other educational institutions, which entitle us to to operate on-campus advertising displays, as well as manage marketing opportunities, media rights and experiential entertainment at sports events. In total, we have displays in all of the 25 largest markets in the U.S. and over 150 markets in the U.S. and Canada. Our top market, high profile location focused portfolio includes sites such as the Bay Bridge in San Francisco, various locations along Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, and sites in and around both Grand Central Station and Times Square in New York. The breadth and depth of our portfolio provides our customers with a range of options to address their marketing objectives, from national, brand-building campaigns to hyper-local campaigns that drive customers to the advertiser's website or retail location one mile down the road.\u201d\nUsing Geopath Out of Home Ratings, the out-of-home advertising industry's audience measurement system, we provide advertisers with the size and demographic composition of the audience that is exposed to individual displays or a complete campaign. As part of our ON Smart Media technology development initiative, we are developing hardware and software solutions for enhanced demographic and location targeting, and engaging ways to connect with consumers on-the-go. Additionally, our OUTFRONT Mobile Network allows our customers to further leverage location targeting with interactive mobile advertising that uses geofence technology to push mobile ads to consumers within a pre-defined radius around a corresponding billboard display or other designated advertising location.\nWe believe out-of-home advertising continues to be an attractive form of advertising, as our displays are ALWAYS ON\u2122, are always viewable and cannot be turned off, skipped, blocked or fast-forwarded. Further, out-of-home advertising can be an effective stand-alone\u201d medium, as well as an integral part of a campaign to reach audiences using multiple forms of media, including television, radio, print, online, mobile and social media advertising platforms. We provide our customers with a differentiated advertising solution at an attractive price point relative to other forms of advertising. In addition to leasing displays, we provide other value-added services to our customers, such as pre-campaign category research, consumer insights, creative design support, print production and post-campaign tracking and analytics, as well as use of a real-time mobile operations reporting system that facilitates proof of performance to customers for substantially all of our business.\nU.S. Media. Our U.S. Media segment generated 25% of its revenues in the New York City metropolitan area in 2016, 27% in 2015 and 23% in 2014, and generated 16% in the Los Angeles metropolitan area in 2016, 15% in 2015, and 13% in 2014. Our U.S. Media segment generated Revenues of $1.39 billion in 2016, $1.34 billion in 2015 and $1.16 billion in 2014, and Operating income before Depreciation, Amortization, Net (gain) loss on dispositions, Stock-based compensation, Restructuring charges, Loss on real estate assets held for sale and Acquisition costs ( Adjusted OIBDA\u201d) of $473.8 million in 2016, $451.1 million in 2015 and $409.2 million in 2014. (See the Segment Results of Operations\u201d section of this MD&A.)\nOther (includes International and Sports Marketing). Other generated Revenues of $120.1 million in 2016, $169.5 million in 2015 and $191.3 million in 2014, and Adjusted OIBDA of $17.8 million in 2016, $24.3 million in 2015, and $31.3 million in 2014.\nEconomic Environment\nOur revenues and operating results are sensitive to fluctuations in advertising expenditures, general economic conditions and other external events beyond our control.\nBusiness Environment\nThe outdoor advertising industry is fragmented, consisting of several companies operating on a national basis, as well as hundreds of smaller regional and local companies operating a limited number of displays in a single or a few local geographic markets. We compete with these companies for customers, structures and display locations. We also compete with other media, including online, mobile and social media advertising platforms and traditional platforms such as, broadcast and cable television, radio, print media and direct mail marketers. Increasing the number of digital billboard displays in our most heavily trafficked locations is an important element of our organic growth strategy, as digital billboard displays have the potential to attract additional business from both new and existing customers. We believe digital billboard displays are attractive to our customers because they allow for the development of richer and more visually engaging messages, provide our customers with the flexibility both to target audiences by time of day and to quickly launch new advertising campaigns, and eliminate or greatly reduce production costs. In addition, digital billboard displays enable us to run multiple advertisements on each display (up to eight per minute). As a result, digital billboard displays generate approximately four times more revenue per display on average than traditional static billboard displays, and digital billboard displays generate higher profits and cash flows than traditional static billboard displays.\nOur revenues and profits may fluctuate due to seasonal advertising patterns and influences on advertising markets. Typically, our revenues and profits are highest in the fourth quarter, during the holiday shopping season, and lowest in the first quarter, as advertisers cut back on spending following the holiday shopping season.\nWe have a diversified base of customers across various industries. During 2016, our largest categories of advertisers were retail, television and healthcare/pharmaceuticals, which represented 9%, 8% and 7% of our total U.S. Media segment revenues, respectively. During 2015, our largest categories of advertisers were retail, television and healthcare/pharmaceuticals, which represented 9%, 9% and 7% of our total U.S. Media segment revenues, respectively. During 2014, our largest categories of advertisers were retail, television and healthcare/pharmaceuticals, which represented 10%, 9% and 8% of our total U.S. Media segment revenues, respectively.\nOur large-scale portfolio allows our customers to reach a national audience and also provides the flexibility to tailor campaigns to specific regions or markets. In 2016, we generated approximately 45% of our U.S. Media segment revenues from national advertising campaigns, compared to 47% in 2015 and 41% in 2014. The increase in revenues from national advertising campaigns in 2016 and 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily due to the impact of the acquisition of certain outdoor advertising businesses of Van Wagner Communications, LLC (the Acquisition\u201d) on October 1, 2014.\nOur transit businesses require us to obtain and renew contracts with municipalities and other governmental entities. When these contracts expire, we generally must participate in highly competitive bidding processes in order to obtain new contracts. In November 2014, we were informed that we were not successful in the renewal of the New York City phone kiosk contract which we obtained as part of the Acquisition and our operation of these kiosks ceased during the first quarter of 2015. In 2015, we generated revenue of $1.6 million related to these operations.\nOur transit contracts with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (the MTA\u201d) represent $225.1 million in revenues, representing 58% of our U.S. Media segment transit and other revenues or 18% of our total U.S. Media segment revenues in 2016. The MTA has issued a Request for Proposals\u201d to prospective operators for the subway, bus and commuter rail (Metro-\nNorth and Long Island Railroad) concessions, in any combination, each for a ten-year contract, with an additional potential five-year renewal period. On May 18, 2016, we submitted a response to the MTA. In mid-October, the MTA issued a follow-up request that refined its timeline and bid requirements, particularly relating to digital deployment and the communications platform and we submitted our response on December 12, 2016. On November 7, 2016, we entered into an agreement with the MTA to extend the expiration of our existing contracts for transit advertising services from December 31, 2016, to June 30, 2017, unless earlier terminated by the MTA on 90 days' notice. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business and Operations-The success of our transit advertising business is dependent on obtaining and renewing key municipal contracts on favorable terms.\u201d)\nKey Performance Indicators\nOur management reviews our performance by focusing on the indicators described below.\nSeveral of our key performance indicators are not prepared in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). We believe these non-GAAP performance indicators are meaningful supplemental measures of our operating performance and should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,513.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,513.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Organic revenues(a)(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,492.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,446.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>204.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>137\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted OIBDA(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>449.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>437.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funds from operations ( FFO\u201d)(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>280.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>272.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted FFO ( AFFO\u201d)(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>294.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>268.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Calculation not meaningful.\n (a) Organic revenues exclude revenues associated with significant acquisitions and divestitures, revenues associated with business lines we no longer operate, and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates ( non-organic revenues\u201d). We provide organic revenues to understand the underlying growth rate of revenue excluding the impact of non-organic revenue items. Our management believes organic revenues are useful to users of our financial data because it enables them to better understand the level of growth of our business period to period. Since organic revenues are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, it should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, revenues as an indicator of operating performance. Organic revenues, as we calculate it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. \n (b) See the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d and Revenues\u201d sections of this MD&A for reconciliations of Operating income to Adjusted OIBDA, Net income (loss) to FFO and AFFO and Revenues to organic revenues. \nAdjusted OIBDA\nWe calculate Adjusted OIBDA as Operating income (loss) before Depreciation, Amortization, Net (gain) loss on dispositions, Stock-based compensation, Restructuring charges, Loss on real estate assets held for sale and Acquisition costs. We calculate Adjusted OIBDA margin by dividing Adjusted OIBDA by total revenues. Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA margin are among the primary measures we use for managing our business, evaluating our operating performance and planning and forecasting future periods, as each is an important indicator of our operational strength and business performance. Our management believes users of our financial data are best served if the information that is made available to them allows them to align their analysis and evaluation of our operating results along the same lines that our management uses in managing, planning and executing our business strategy. Our management also believes that the presentations of Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA margin, as supplemental measures, are useful in evaluating our business because eliminating certain non-comparable items highlight operational trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. It is management's opinion that these supplemental measures provide users of our financial data with an important perspective on our operating performance and also make it easier for users of our financial data to compare our results with other companies that have different financing and capital structures or tax rates.\nFFO and AFFO\nWe calculate FFO in accordance with the definition established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d). FFO reflects net income (loss) adjusted to exclude gains and losses from the sale of real estate assets, depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, amortization of direct lease acquisition costs, the non-cash effect of loss on\nreal estate assets held for sale and the same adjustments for our equity-based investments, as well as the related income tax effect of adjustments, as applicable. We calculate AFFO as FFO adjusted to include cash paid for direct lease acquisition costs as such costs are generally amortized over a period ranging from four weeks to one year and therefore are incurred on a regular basis. AFFO also includes cash paid for maintenance capital expenditures since these are routine uses of cash that are necessary for our operations. In addition, AFFO excludes costs related to the Acquisition and restructuring charges, as well as certain non-cash items, including non-real estate depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, accretion expense, the non-cash effect of straight-line rent and amortization of deferred financing costs, and the non-cash portion of income taxes, as well as the related income tax effect of adjustments, as applicable. Our calculation of AFFO was revised in 2016 to adjust for the non-cash portion of income taxes instead of adjusting for current or deferred income taxes, as management believes that this calculation of AFFO is more consistent with AFFO presented by other REITs and analyzed by users of our financial data. This change is reflected in the calculation of AFFO for 2015. We use FFO and AFFO measures for managing our business and for planning and forecasting future periods, and each is an important indicator of our operational strength and business performance, especially compared to other REITs. Our management believes users of our financial data are best served if the information that is made available to them allows them to align their analysis and evaluation of our operating results along the same lines that our management uses in managing, planning and executing our business strategy. Our management also believes that the presentations of FFO, AFFO, and related per weighted average share amounts, as supplemental measures, are useful in evaluating our business because adjusting results to reflect items that have more bearing on the operating performance of REITs highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. It is management's opinion that these supplemental measures provide users of our financial data with an important perspective on our operating performance and also make it easier to compare our results to other companies in our industry, as well as to REITs.\nSince Adjusted OIBDA, Adjusted OIBDA margin, FFO and AFFO and, as applicable, related per weighted average share amounts, are not measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, Operating income (loss), Net income (loss), Revenues and Net income (loss) per common share for basic and diluted earnings per share, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, as indicators of operating performance. These measures, as we calculate them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition, these measures do not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and are not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe following table reconciles Operating income to Adjusted OIBDA, and Net income (loss) to FFO and AFFO.\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

2016.

Our contracts with customers generally cover periods ranging from four weeks to one year. Revenues from billboard displays are recognized as rental income on a straight-line basis over the contract term. Transit and other revenues are recognized as earned over the contract period. For space provided to advertisers through the use of an advertising agency whose commission is calculated based on a stated percentage of gross advertising spending, our Revenues are reported net of agency commissions.\n2016 vs. 2015\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Constant dollar revenues, as we calculate them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. \nTotal revenues increased $160.0 million, or 12%, and organic revenues increased $48.0 million, or 4%, in 2015 compared to 2014. In constant dollars, revenues increased $183.4 million, or 14%, and organic revenues increased $48.0 million, or 4%, in 2015 compared to 2014.\nNon-organic revenues primarily reflect the Acquisition ($194.7 million in 2015 and $55.2 million in 2014), the discontinuation of a business line in April 2014 and other acquisitions and dispositions.\nTotal billboard revenues increased $112.8 million, or 12%, in 2015 compared to 2014, principally driven by the impact of the Acquisition, the conversion of traditional static billboard displays to digital billboard displays and an increase in production and installation revenues, partially offset by a decline in average revenue per display (yield) and the unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of $20.3 million. In constant dollars, billboard revenues increased $133.1 million, or 14%, in 2015 compared to 2014.\nTotal transit and other revenues increased $47.2 million, or 12%, in 2015 compared to 2014, driven by the impact of the Acquisition and stronger market conditions in local and national advertising that increased yield.\nExpenses\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>818.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>833.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>726.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>264.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>258.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>224.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(73\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on real estate assets held for sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(99\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (gain) loss on dispositions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>108.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>113.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>115.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>115.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,309.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,427.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,170.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n * Calculation is not meaningful. \nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses are composed of the following:\nBillboard property lease expenses. These expenses reflect the cost of leasing the real property on which our billboards are mounted. These lease agreements have terms varying between one month and multiple years, and usually provide renewal options. Rental expenses are comprised of a fixed monthly amount and under certain agreements, also include contingent rent, which varies based on the revenues we generate from the leased site. Property leases are generally paid in advance for periods ranging from one to twelve months. The fixed rent is expensed evenly over the contract term and the contingent rent is expensed as incurred when the related revenues are recognized.\nTransit franchise expenses. These expenses reflect costs charged by municipalities and transit operators under transit advertising contracts and are generally calculated based on a percentage of the revenues we generate under the contract, with a minimum guarantee. The costs that are determined based on a percentage of revenues are expensed as incurred when the related revenues are recognized, and the minimum guarantee is expensed over the contract term.\nPosting, maintenance and other site-related expenses. These expenses primarily reflect costs associated with posting and rotation, materials, repairs and maintenance, utilities and property taxes.\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Billboard property lease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>364.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>369.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>291.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transit franchise\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>230.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>227.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>203.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Posting, maintenance and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>222.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>236.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>230.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>818.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>833.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>726.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBillboard property lease expenses represented 34% of billboard revenues in each of 2016 and 2015, and 30% in 2014. Transit franchise expenses represented 63% of transit revenues in each of 2016 and 2015, and 62% in 2014. Billboard property lease and transit franchise expenses decreased by $1.0 million in 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease in billboard property lease expenses in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to the impact of the Disposition (a decrease of $12.2 million compared to 2015) and lost billboard leases in 2016, partially offset by increases in billboard property lease expenses in our U.S. Media segment. Excluding the impact of the Disposition in 2016, billboard property lease expenses increased 2% in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in transit franchise expenses in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to the increase in transit revenues, partially offset by the impact of the Disposition (a decrease of $3.6 million compared to 2015). Billboard property lease and transit franchise expenses increased by $101.0 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase in billboard property lease expenses in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to the Acquisition. The increase in transit franchise expenses in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to the increase in transit revenues.\nPosting, maintenance and other expenses as a percentage of Revenues were 15% in 2016, 16% in 2015 and 17% in 2014. Posting, maintenance and other expenses decreased $14.0 million, or 6%, in 2016 compared to 2015, principally due to the impact of the Disposition (a decrease of $17.1 million compared to 2015). Excluding the impact of the Disposition, posting, maintenance and other expenses increased 1% in 2016 compared to 2015. Posting, maintenance and other expenses increased $5.6 million, or 2%, in 2015 compared to 2014, principally due to the impact of the Acquisition and higher production and installation costs, which are typically billed to the advertiser and recorded as Revenues, partially offset by a decrease in taxes, posting, materials and utilities expenses, and a favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses ( SG&A\u201d)\nSG&A expenses represented 17% of Revenues in each of 2016, 2015 and 2014. SG&A expenses increased $6.5 million, or 3%, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to increased sales and other compensation-related expenses and one-time professional fees in 2016 of $3.8 million associated with implementing initiatives to improve our cost base and pricing/yield management, partially offset by the impact of the Disposition (a decrease of $11.5 million compared to 2015), lower administrative costs and non-recurring legal expenses in 2015 of $5.2 million. Excluding the impact of the Disposition, SG&A expenses increased 7% in 2016 compared to 2015. SG&A expenses increased $34.0 million, or 15%, in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to the impact of the Acquisition, increased strategic business development expenses of $9.8 million, incremental stand-alone costs of $6.3 million and non-recurring legal expenses of $5.2 million.\nRestructuring Charges\nIn 2016, we recorded restructuring charges of $2.5 million for severance charges associated with the reorganization of our sales management and administrative functions. In 2015, we recorded restructuring charges of $2.6 million associated with the elimination of management positions and the elimination of positions in connection with the sale of assets and the consolidation of leased locations. In 2014, we recorded restructuring charges of $9.8 million associated with the reorganization of management, resulting in the departures of two executive officers. The restructuring charges in 2014 are comprised of severance charges, including stock-based compensation of $5.6 million.\nLoss on Real Estate Assets Held for Sale\nIn connection with the Disposition, the assets of our outdoor advertising business in Latin America had been classified as Assets held for sale on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as of December 31, 2015. It is required that we measure assets held for sale at the lower of their carrying value (including unrecognized foreign currency translation adjustment losses) or fair value less cost to sell. The impact of including unrecognized foreign currency translation adjustment losses in the carrying value of assets held for sale resulted in a non-cash loss on real estate assets held for sale of approximately $103.6 million in 2015. Upon completion of the Disposition in 2016, the unrecognized foreign currency translation adjustment loss was reclassified to earnings from Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.\nNet (Gain) Loss on Dispositions\nNet gain on dispositions was $1.9 million in 2016. Net loss on dispositions was $0.7 million in 2015. Net gain on dispositions in 2014 was $2.5 million and includes a gain of $0.6 million related to the divestiture of a transit shelter operation in the greater Los Angeles area.\nDepreciation\nDepreciation decreased $4.8 million, or 4%, in 2016 compared to 2015, due primarily to the impact of the Disposition, partially offset by higher depreciation associated with the increased number of digital billboards. Both digital and static billboards are depreciated over an estimated useful life of 5 years to 20 years. Depreciation increased $6.5 million, or 6%, in 2015 compared to 2014, due primarily to the impact of the Acquisition and higher depreciation associated with the increased number of digital billboards.\nAmortization\nAmortization decreased $0.1 million in 2016 compared to 2015, principally driven by lower amortization of intangible assets, partially offset by increased direct lease acquisition costs in 2016 compared to 2015. Amortization increased $20.4 million in 2015 compared to 2014, principally driven by amortization related to the intangible assets associated with the Acquisition. Amortization expense includes the amortization of direct lease acquisition costs of $38.2 million in 2016, $36.3 million in 2015 and $33.8 million in 2014. Capitalized direct lease acquisition costs were $38.0 million in 2016, $36.3 million in 2015 and $33.8 million in 2014.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense, net, was $113.8 million (including $6.4 million of deferred financing costs) in 2016, $114.8 million (including $6.3 million of deferred financing costs) in 2015 and $84.8 million (including $12.1 million of deferred financing costs) in 2014.\nBenefit (Provision) for Income Taxes\nIn 2014, as a result of our REIT conversion, substantially all Deferred income tax liabilities, net, was reversed into Net income via a non-cash benefit of approximately $235.6 million. As a result of our REIT conversion, our effective tax rate for the second half of 2014 was substantially lower than previous periods. We believe that the assumptions and estimates used to determine these tax amounts were reasonable. However, the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may not necessarily reflect our income tax expense or tax payments, or what our tax amounts would have been if we had been a stand-alone company operating as a REIT during the periods prior to July 16, 2014, when we were separated from CBS Corporation (the Separation\u201d).\nThe Provision for income taxes was $5.4 million in each of 2016 and 2015 and the Benefit for income taxes in 2014 was $206.0 million, including the reversal of $235.6 million, representing substantially all Deferred income tax liabilities, net, as a result of our REIT conversion. Excluding the Loss on real estate assets held for sale of $103.6 million in 2015 and the non-cash benefit recorded as a result of our REIT conversion in 2014, the effective income tax rate was 5.9% for 2016, 7.2% for 2015 and 30.3% for 2014. As a result of our REIT conversion, our 2016 and 2015 tax rates are substantially lower than 2014.\nNet Income (Loss)\nIn 2016, Net income was $90.9 million compared to a Net loss of $29.4 million in 2015, primarily due to the impact of the Disposition, and a Loss on real estate assets held for sale and non-recurring legal expenses in 2015, partially offset by higher sales and other compensation-related expenses and one-time professional fees in 2016 of $3.8 million associated with implementing initiatives to improve our cost base and pricing/yield management. In 2015, Net loss was $29.4 million compared to Net income of $306.9 million in 2014, primarily due to a Loss on real estate assets held for sale in 2015, the write-off of deferred taxes in 2014 in connection with our conversion to a REIT, the impact of the Acquisition on Revenues, Total expenses and Interest expense, net, increased stand-alone costs, strategic business development expenses and legal expenses, the majority of which were expected to be non-recurring, and increased interest expenses related to the Term Loan (as defined below) and the issuance of $800.0 million of senior unsecured notes on January 31, 2014, partially offset by a lower provision for income taxes as a result of our REIT conversion.\nSegment Results of Operations\nWe present Adjusted OIBDA as the primary measure of profit and loss for our operating segments in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB\u201d) guidance for segment reporting. (See the Key Performance Indicators\u201d section of this MD&A and Item 8., Note 18. Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements.)\nEffective April 1, 2016, we changed the segments that we use to review operating results and make decisions regarding segment performance and resource allocation. Given the changes in our portfolio resulting from the Disposition and recent acquisitions, we made this change to better align our segments with our business strategy. We currently manage our operations through three operating segments-(1) U.S. Billboard and Transit, which is included in our U.S. Media reportable segment, (2) International and (3) Sports Marketing. International and Sports Marketing do not meet the criteria to be a reportable segment and accordingly, are both included in Other. Our new segment reporting therefore includes U.S. Media and Other.\nThe following table presents our Revenues, Adjusted OIBDA, Operating income (loss) and Depreciation and Amortization by segment, in 2016, 2015 and 2014. Historical financial information by reportable segment has been recast to reflect the changes in segment reporting with no impact to previously reported consolidated financial statements. Prior to April 1, 2016, our International segment included our advertising businesses in Canada and Latin America (see Item 8., Note 12. Acquisitions and Dispositions: Dispositions to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Historical operating results for our advertising business in Latin America are included in Other.\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Other SG&A expenses decreased $1.9 million, or 5%, in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily driven by the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by higher compensation-related expenses and professional fees.\nOther Adjusted OIBDA decreased $7.0 million, or 22%, in 2015 compared to 2014, driven by higher expenses. In constant dollars, Other Adjusted OIBDA decreased $3.2 million, or 12%, in 2015 compared to 2014.\nCorporate\nCorporate expenses primarily include expenses associated with employees who provide centralized services. Corporate expenses, excluding restructuring charges, costs related to the Acquisition and stock-based compensation, were $42.6 million in 2016, $37.8 million in 2015 and $27.1 million in 2014. The increase in corporate expenses in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily reflects increased compensation-related expenses and one-time professional fees in 2016 of $3.8 million associated with implementing initiatives to improve our cost base and pricing/yield management, partially offset by non-recurring legal expenses in 2015 of $5.2 million. The increase in corporate expenses in 2015 compared to 2014 reflect incremental stand-alone costs of $6.3 million, non-recurring legal expenses of $5.2 million, and increased strategic business development expenses of $4.1 million, partially offset by decreases in compensation expense.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assets:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>65.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(36\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Receivables, less allowances of $9.2 in 2016 and $8.9 in 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>222.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>209.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prepaid lease and transit franchise costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other prepaid expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assets held for sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other current assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(38\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total current assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>378.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>412.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liabilities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accrued compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accrued interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accrued lease costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other accrued expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liabilities held for sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other current liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total current liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>251.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>265.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Working capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>126.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>146.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n * Calculation is not meaningful. \nWe continually project anticipated cash requirements for our operating, investing and financing needs as well as cash flows generated from operating activities available to meet these needs. Due to seasonal advertising patterns and influences on advertising markets, our revenues and operating income are typically highest in the fourth quarter, during the holiday shopping season, and lowest in the first quarter, as advertisers cut back on spending following the holiday shopping season. Further, some of our municipal transit contracts, as well as our marketing and multimedia rights agreements with colleges and universities, require guaranteed minimum annual payments to be paid at the beginning of the year.\nOur short-term cash requirements primarily include payments for operating leases, guaranteed minimum annual payments, capital expenditures, interest and dividends. Funding for short-term cash needs will come primarily from our cash on hand, operating cash flows and borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) or other secured credit facilities that we may establish.\nIn addition, as part of our growth strategy, we frequently evaluate strategic opportunities to acquire new businesses, assets or digital technology. Consistent with this strategy, we regularly evaluate potential acquisitions, ranging from small transactions to larger acquisitions, which transactions could be funded through cash on hand, additional borrowings, equity or other securities, or some combination thereof.\nOur long-term cash needs include principal payments on outstanding indebtedness. Funding for long-term cash needs will come from our cash on hand, operating cash flows, our ability to issue debt and equity securities, and borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility or other secured credit facilities that we may establish.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had net indebtedness of approximately $2.1 billion.\nOn February 22, 2017, we announced that our board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.36 per share on our common stock, payable on March 31, 2017, to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 10, 2017.\nDebt\nLong-term debt, net, consists of the following:\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term loan, due 2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>659.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>748.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior unsecured notes:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5.250% senior unsecured notes, due 2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>549.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>549.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5.625% senior unsecured notes, due 2024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>503.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>503.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5.875% senior unsecured notes, due 2025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>450.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>450.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total senior unsecured notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,502.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,502.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt issuance costs(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total long-term debt, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,136.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,222.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average cost of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) See Item 8., Note 3.

The discount is being amortized through Interest expense, net, on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nAs of December 31, 2016, a premium of $3.0 million on $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 5.625% Senior Unsecured Notes, due 2024, remains unamortized. The premium is being amortized through Interest expense, net, on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nWe have a $425.0 million Revolving Credit Facility, which matures in 2019 (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d).\nAs of December 31, 2016, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nThe commitment fee based on the amount of unused commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility was $1.8 million in 2016 and $1.9 million in each of 2015 and 2014. As of December 31, 2016, we had issued letters of credit totaling approximately $31.7 million against the Revolving Credit Facility.\nDebt Covenants\nThe credit agreement dated January 31, 2014 (the Credit Agreement\u201d), governing the Term Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility, and the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes contain customary affirmative and negative covenants, subject to certain exceptions, including but not limited to those that limit the Company's and our subsidiaries' abilities to (i) pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect to the Company's or its wholly-owned subsidiary, Outfront Media Capital LLC's capital stock or make other restricted payments other than dividends or distributions necessary for us to maintain our REIT status, subject to certain conditions, and (ii) enter into agreements restricting certain subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany transfers.\nThe terms of the Credit Agreement require that, as long as any commitments remain outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, we maintain a Consolidated Net Secured Leverage Ratio, which is the ratio of (i) our consolidated secured debt (less up to $150.0 million of unrestricted cash) to (ii) our Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for the trailing four consecutive quarters, of no greater than 4.0 to 1.0. As of December 31, 2016, our Consolidated Net Secured Leverage Ratio was 1.3 to 1.0, as adjusted for the non-cash loss on real estate assets held for sale related to the Disposition and to give pro forma effect to acquisitions and dispositions, in accordance with the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement also requires that, in connection with the incurrence of certain indebtedness, we maintain a Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, which is the ratio of our consolidated total debt to our Consolidated EBITDA for the trailing four consecutive quarters, of no greater than 6.0 to 1.0. As of December 31, 2016, our Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio was 4.7 to 1.0, as adjusted for the non-cash loss on real estate assets held for sale related to the Disposition and to give pro forma effect to acquisitions and dispositions, in accordance with the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2016, we are in compliance with our debt covenants.\nLetter of Credit Facility\nEffective January 31, 2017, we completed the bifurcation process of our letter of credit facility between two institutions for administrative purposes. As of February 23, 2017, our letter of credit facilities totaled $80.0 million.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we issued letters of credit totaling approximately $68.0 million under our aggregate letter of credit facilities. The fees under the letter of credit facility in 2016, 2015 and 2014 were immaterial.\nDeferred Financing Costs\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had deferred $26.9 million in fees and expenses associated with the Term Loan, Revolving Credit Facility, letter of credit facility and our senior unsecured notes. We are amortizing the deferred fees through Interest expense, net, on the Consolidated Statement of Operations over the respective terms of the Term Loan, Revolving Credit Facility, letter of credit facility and our senior unsecured notes.\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth our cash flows in 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>287.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>293.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>262.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used for investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(36.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(62.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(798.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(41\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(92\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by (used for) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(286.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(148.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>536.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(91\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) to cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(36.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>78.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n * Calculation is not meaningful. \nCash provided by operating activities decreased $6.0 million in 2016 compared to 2015, due primarily to the timing of interest payments on our debt and the timing of commissions and other expense payments, partially offset by higher net income, as adjusted for non-cash items. Cash provided by operating activities increased $30.3 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to higher net income, as adjusted for non-cash items, resulting from the impact of the Acquisition and lower income taxes due to our REIT conversion. This was partially offset by an increased use of working capital driven by an increase in accounts\nreceivable and decreases in accounts payables and accrued expenses. These working capital increases were offset by lower cash paid for income taxes.\nAfter the Separation, we began operating as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Actual cash payments for income taxes were $1.2 million in 2016, $5.8 million in 2015 and $53.0 million in 2014, including payments made to CBS Corporation ( CBS\u201d).\nCash used for investing activities decreased $25.7 million in 2016 compared to 2015 and decreased $736.0 million in 2015 compared to 2014. In 2016, we completed several small acquisitions for a total purchase price of approximately $67.9 million, incurred $59.4 million in capital expenditures and received $90.6 million in proceeds from dispositions, primarily related to the Disposition. In 2015, we completed several small acquisitions for a total purchase price of approximately $12.1 million, incurred $59.2 million in capital expenditures and received $8.9 million in proceeds from dispositions, primarily related to the disposition of substantially all of our assets in Puerto Rico. In 2014, we completed the Acquisition for a total purchase price of approximately $714.2 million (including working capital adjustments), completed several smaller acquisitions for a total purchase price of approximately $19.6 million, incurred $64.2 million in capital expenditures and made an investment of $3.0 million in Videri Inc. in connection with licenses and services to be received under a development and license agreement with Videri Inc. and its affiliate, and received $4.5 million in proceeds from dispositions.\nThe following table presents our capital expenditures in 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Growth\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital expenditures increased $0.2 million in 2016 compared to 2015, driven by installation of the most current LED lighting technology to improve the quality and extend the life of our static billboards and an increase in digital display spending, partially offset by decreased expenditures related to the Disposition and the renovation of certain office facilities. Capital expenditures decreased $5.0 million, or 8%, in 2015 compared to 2014, driven by a decline in digital display spending, partially offset by increased investments in information technology and expenditures to renovate certain office facilities.\nFor the full year of 2017, we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately $65.0 million to $70.0 million, which will be used primarily for growth in digital displays, installation of the most current LED lighting technology to improve the quality and extend the life of our static billboards, billboard maintenance and to renovate certain office facilities.\nCash used for financing activities increased $137.9 million in 2016 compared 2015. Cash provided by financing activities was $536.6 million in 2014. In 2016, we paid cash dividends of $188.6 million and made discretionary payments totaling $90.0 million on the Term Loan. In 2015, we paid cash dividends $196.3 million, prepaid $50.0 million on the Term Loan and incurred debt, including a premium, of $103.8 million. In 2014, we incurred debt of $600.0 million related to the Acquisition on October 1, 2014, retained $100.0 million related to our IPO, retained $50.0 million related to the incurrence of $1.6 billion of indebtedness on January 31, 2014, received $49.3 million of net capital contributions from CBS and paid cash dividends of $242.7 million.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2016, our significant contractual obligations and payments due by period were as follows:\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018-2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020-2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022 and thereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Guaranteed minimum annual payments(a)(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>435.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>158.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>113.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>109.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases(c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>995.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>226.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>177.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>471.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt(d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,160.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>660.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,500.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest(d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>662.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>207.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>188.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>163.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,253.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>381.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>547.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,080.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,244.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) We have agreements with municipalities and transit operators which entitle us to operate advertising displays within their transit systems, including on the interior and exterior of rail and subway cars and buses, as well as on benches, transit shelters, street kiosks, and transit platforms. Under most of these franchise agreements, the franchisor is entitled to receive the greater of a percentage of the relevant revenues, net of agency fees, or a specified guaranteed minimum annual payment. Franchise rights are generally paid monthly, or in some cases upfront at the beginning of the year. \n (b) We also have marketing and multimedia rights agreements with colleges, universities and other educational institutions, which entitle us to operate on-campus advertising displays, as well as manage marketing opportunities, media rights and experiential entertainment at sports events. Under most of these agreements, the school is entitled to receive the greater of a percentage of the relevant revenue, net of agency commissions, or a specified guaranteed minimum annual payment. \n (c) Consists of non-cancellable operating leases with terms in excess of one year for billboard sites, office space and equipment. Total future minimum payments of $995.0 million include $955.6 million for our billboard sites. Excludes rent on cancellable leases and leases with terms of under one year, as well as contingent rent. (See Item 8, Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about our contractual obligations.) \n (d) As of December 31, 2016, we had long-term debt of approximately $2.2 billion. Interest on the Term Loan is variable. For illustrative purposes, we are assuming an interest rate of 3.0% for all years, which reflects the interest rate as of December 31, 2016. An increase or decrease of 1/4% in the interest rate will change the annual interest expense by $1.7 million. \nThe above table excludes $0.6 million of reserves for uncertain tax positions and the related accrued interest and penalties, as we cannot reasonably predict the amount of and timing of cash payments related to this obligation.\nIn 2017, we expect to contribute $2.0 million to our pension plans. Contributions to our pension plans were $2.0 million in each of 2016 and 2015, and $1.6 million in 2014.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOur off-balance sheet commitments primarily consist of operating lease arrangements and guaranteed minimum annual payments. (See Item 8, Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our off-balance sheet commitments.)\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions.\nWe consider the following accounting policies to be the most critical as they are significant to its financial condition and results of operations, and require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in their application. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, see Item 8., Note 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGoodwill\nWe test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis on October 31 of each year and between annual tests should factors or indicators become apparent that would require an interim test. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting-unit level. We elected to perform the two-step quantitative impairment test in 2016.\nThe first step of the goodwill impairment test examines whether the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. We compute the estimated fair value of each reporting unit by adding the present value of the estimated annual cash flows over a discrete projection period to the residual value of the business at the end of the projection period. This technique requires us to use significant estimates and assumptions such as growth rates, operating margins, capital expenditures and discount rates. The estimated growth rates, operating margins and capital expenditures for the projection period are based on our internal forecasts of future performance as well as historical trends. The residual value is estimated based on a perpetual nominal growth rate, which is based on projected long-range inflation and long-term industry projections. The discount rates are determined based on the weighted average cost of capital of comparable entities. A downward revision of these assumptions would decrease the fair values of our reporting units.\nIf the fair value of a reporting unit falls below its carrying value, excluding any impacts from foreign currency translation adjustments reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Statement Financial Position in conformity with GAAP, we would then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of any non-cash impairment charge. Such a charge could have a material effect on the statement of operations and statement of financial position.\nLong-Lived Assets\nWe report long-lived assets, including billboard advertising structures, other property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. We depreciate or amortize these assets over their estimated useful lives, which generally range from five to 40 years. For billboard advertising structures, we estimate the useful lives based on the estimated economic life of the asset. Transit fixed assets are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the related contractual term. Our long-lived identifiable intangible assets primarily consist of acquired permits and leasehold agreements and franchise agreements, which grant us the right to operate out-of-home advertising structures in specified locations and the right to provide advertising displays on railroad and municipal transit properties. Our long-lived identifiable intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which is the respective life of the agreement and in some cases includes an estimation for renewals, which is based on historical experience.\nLong-lived assets subject to depreciation and amortization are also reviewed for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the long-lived asset might be impaired, by comparing the forecasted undiscounted cash flows to be generated by those assets to the carrying values of those assets. The significant assumptions we use to determine the useful lives and fair values of long-lived assets include contractual commitments, regulatory requirements, future expected cash flows and industry growth rates, as well as future salvage values.\nLong-lived assets are assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted cash flows generated by those assets to the respective asset's carrying value, excluding any impacts from foreign currency translation adjustments reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Statement Financial Position in conformity with GAAP. The amount of impairment loss, if any, will be measured by the difference between the net carrying value and the estimated fair value of the asset and recognized as a non-cash charge. Long-lived assets held for sale are required to be measured at the lower of their carrying value (including unrecognized foreign currency translation adjustment losses) or fair value less cost to sell.\nAsset Retirement Obligation\nWe record an asset retirement obligation for our estimated future legal obligation, upon termination or nonrenewal of a lease, associated with removing structures from the leased property and, when required by the contract, the cost to return the leased property to its original condition. These obligations are recorded at their present value in the period in which the liability is incurred and are capitalized as part of the related assets' carrying value. Accretion of the liability is recognized in operating expenses and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the expected useful life of the related asset. The obligation is calculated based on the assumption that all of our advertising structures will be removed within the next 50 years. The significant assumptions used in estimating the asset retirement obligation include the cost of removing the asset, the cost of remediating the leased property to its original condition where required and the timing and number of lease renewals, all of which are estimated based on historical experience.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method of accounting. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nOn July 17, 2014, we began operating as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As long as we remain qualified to be taxed as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our REIT taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify to be taxed as a REIT in any taxable year and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates and will be precluded from re-electing to be taxed as a REIT for the subsequent four taxable years following the year during which we lose our REIT qualification. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income or property, and the income of our TRSs will be subject to taxation at regular corporate rates. Our qualification to be taxed as a REIT will depend upon our ability to meet on a continuing basis, through actual investment and operating results, various complex requirements under the Code, related to, among other things, the sources of our gross income, the composition and values of our assets, our distribution levels and the diversity of ownership of our shares. We believe we are organized in conformity with these requirements and that our manner of operation will enable us to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT. (See Item 1. Business-Tax Status.\u201d)\nAs a REIT, we must distribute to our stockholders, at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain. To the extent that we satisfy the 90% distribution requirement, but distribute less than 100% of our taxable income, we will be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on the undistributed income. In addition, we would be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which our distributions in any calendar year are less than a minimum amount specified under U.S. federal income tax laws. We intend to pay regular quarterly distributions to our stockholders in an amount not less than 100% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for dividends paid).\nPrior to July 17, 2014, we were a member of CBS's consolidated tax group, and the provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and income tax payments were calculated on a separate tax return basis. These amounts may not necessarily reflect the income tax expense or tax payments that would have been reported if we had been operating as a stand-alone company, and would not reflect what our income tax expense or tax payments would have been as a REIT during the periods prior to the Separation. We believe that the assumptions and estimates used to determine these tax amounts were reasonable.\nAccounting Standards\nSee Item 8., Note 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for information about adoption of new accounting standards and recent accounting pronouncements.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d This MD&A contains forward-looking statements that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. The forward-looking statements are subject to a number of important factors, including, but not limited to, those factors discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results described herein or implied by such forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nOUTFRONT Media is a real estate investment trust ( REIT\u201d), which provides advertising space ( displays\u201d) on out-of-home advertising structures and sites in the United States (the U.S.\u201d) and Canada. We currently manage our operations through three operating segments-(1) U.S. Billboard and Transit, which is included in our U.S. Media reportable segment, (2) International and (3) Sports Marketing. International and Sports Marketing do not meet the criteria to be a reportable segment and accordingly, are both included in Other (see Item 8., Note 18. Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Prior to April 1, 2016, our International segment included our advertising businesses in Canada and Latin America.\nOn April 1, 2016, we sold all of our equity interests in certain of our subsidiaries (the Disposition\u201d), which held all of the assets of our outdoor advertising business in Latin America. (See Item 8., Note 12. Acquisitions and Dispositions: Dispositions to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) The operating results of our outdoor advertising business in Latin America through April 1, 2016, are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements for 2016, 2015 and 2014, and are included in Other in our segment reporting.\nBusiness\nWe are one of the largest providers of advertising space on out-of-home advertising structures and sites across the U.S. and Canada. Our inventory consists of billboard displays, which are primarily located on the most heavily traveled highways and roadways in top Nielsen Designated Market Areas ( DMAs\u201d), and transit advertising displays operated under exclusive multi-year contracts with municipalities in large cities across the U.S. and Canada. We also have marketing and multimedia rights agreements with colleges, universities and other educational institutions, which entitle us to to operate on-campus advertising displays, as well as manage marketing opportunities, media rights and experiential entertainment at sports events. In total, we have displays in all of the 25 largest markets in the U.S. and over 150 markets in the U.S. and Canada. Our top market, high profile location focused portfolio includes sites such as the Bay Bridge in San Francisco, various locations along Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, and sites in and around both Grand Central Station and Times Square in New York. The breadth and depth of our portfolio provides our customers with a range of options to address their marketing objectives, from national, brand-building campaigns to hyper-local campaigns that drive customers to the advertiser's website or retail location one mile down the road.\u201d\nUsing Geopath Out of Home Ratings, the out-of-home advertising industry's audience measurement system, we provide advertisers with the size and demographic composition of the audience that is exposed to individual displays or a complete campaign. As part of our ON Smart Media technology development initiative, we are developing hardware and software solutions for enhanced demographic and location targeting, and engaging ways to connect with consumers on-the-go. Additionally, our OUTFRONT Mobile Network allows our customers to further leverage location targeting with interactive mobile advertising that uses geofence technology to push mobile ads to consumers within a pre-defined radius around a corresponding billboard display or other designated advertising location.\nWe believe out-of-home advertising continues to be an attractive form of advertising, as our displays are ALWAYS ON\u2122, are always viewable and cannot be turned off, skipped, blocked or fast-forwarded. Further, out-of-home advertising can be an effective stand-alone\u201d medium, as well as an integral part of a campaign to reach audiences using multiple forms of media, including television, radio, print, online, mobile and social media advertising platforms. We provide our customers with a differentiated advertising solution at an attractive price point relative to other forms of advertising. In addition to leasing displays, we provide other value-added services to our customers, such as pre-campaign category research, consumer insights, creative design support, print production and post-campaign tracking and analytics, as well as use of a real-time mobile operations reporting system that facilitates proof of performance to customers for substantially all of our business.\nU.S. Media. Our U.S. Media segment generated 25% of its revenues in the New York City metropolitan area in 2016, 27% in 2015 and 23% in 2014, and generated 16% in the Los Angeles metropolitan area in 2016, 15% in 2015, and 13% in 2014. Our U.S. Media segment generated Revenues of $1.39 billion in 2016, $1.34 billion in 2015 and $1.16 billion in 2014, and Operating income before Depreciation, Amortization, Net (gain) loss on dispositions, Stock-based compensation, Restructuring charges, Loss on real estate assets held for sale and Acquisition costs ( Adjusted OIBDA\u201d) of $473.8 million in 2016, $451.1 million in 2015 and $409.2 million in 2014. (See the Segment Results of Operations\u201d section of this MD&A.)\nOther (includes International and Sports Marketing). Other generated Revenues of $120.1 million in 2016, $169.5 million in 2015 and $191.3 million in 2014, and Adjusted OIBDA of $17.8 million in 2016, $24.3 million in 2015, and $31.3 million in 2014.\nEconomic Environment\nOur revenues and operating results are sensitive to fluctuations in advertising expenditures, general economic conditions and other external events beyond our control.\nBusiness Environment\nThe outdoor advertising industry is fragmented, consisting of several companies operating on a national basis, as well as hundreds of smaller regional and local companies operating a limited number of displays in a single or a few local geographic markets. We compete with these companies for customers, structures and display locations. We also compete with other media, including online, mobile and social media advertising platforms and traditional platforms such as, broadcast and cable television, radio, print media and direct mail marketers. Increasing the number of digital billboard displays in our most heavily trafficked locations is an important element of our organic growth strategy, as digital billboard displays have the potential to attract additional business from both new and existing customers. We believe digital billboard displays are attractive to our customers because they allow for the development of richer and more visually engaging messages, provide our customers with the flexibility both to target audiences by time of day and to quickly launch new advertising campaigns, and eliminate or greatly reduce production costs. In addition, digital billboard displays enable us to run multiple advertisements on each display (up to eight per minute). As a result, digital billboard displays generate approximately four times more revenue per display on average than traditional static billboard displays, and digital billboard displays generate higher profits and cash flows than traditional static billboard displays.\nOur revenues and profits may fluctuate due to seasonal advertising patterns and influences on advertising markets. Typically, our revenues and profits are highest in the fourth quarter, during the holiday shopping season, and lowest in the first quarter, as advertisers cut back on spending following the holiday shopping season.\nWe have a diversified base of customers across various industries. During 2016, our largest categories of advertisers were retail, television and healthcare/pharmaceuticals, which represented 9%, 8% and 7% of our total U.S. Media segment revenues, respectively. During 2015, our largest categories of advertisers were retail, television and healthcare/pharmaceuticals, which represented 9%, 9% and 7% of our total U.S. Media segment revenues, respectively. During 2014, our largest categories of advertisers were retail, television and healthcare/pharmaceuticals, which represented 10%, 9% and 8% of our total U.S. Media segment revenues, respectively.\nOur large-scale portfolio allows our customers to reach a national audience and also provides the flexibility to tailor campaigns to specific regions or markets. In 2016, we generated approximately 45% of our U.S. Media segment revenues from national advertising campaigns, compared to 47% in 2015 and 41% in 2014. The increase in revenues from national advertising campaigns in 2016 and 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily due to the impact of the acquisition of certain outdoor advertising businesses of Van Wagner Communications, LLC (the Acquisition\u201d) on October 1, 2014.\nOur transit businesses require us to obtain and renew contracts with municipalities and other governmental entities. When these contracts expire, we generally must participate in highly competitive bidding processes in order to obtain new contracts. In November 2014, we were informed that we were not successful in the renewal of the New York City phone kiosk contract which we obtained as part of the Acquisition and our operation of these kiosks ceased during the first quarter of 2015. In 2015, we generated revenue of $1.6 million related to these operations.\nOur transit contracts with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (the MTA\u201d) represent $225.1 million in revenues, representing 58% of our U.S. Media segment transit and other revenues or 18% of our total U.S. Media segment revenues in 2016. The MTA has issued a Request for Proposals\u201d to prospective operators for the subway, bus and commuter rail (Metro-\nNorth and Long Island Railroad) concessions, in any combination, each for a ten-year contract, with an additional potential five-year renewal period. On May 18, 2016, we submitted a response to the MTA. In mid-October, the MTA issued a follow-up request that refined its timeline and bid requirements, particularly relating to digital deployment and the communications platform and we submitted our response on December 12, 2016. On November 7, 2016, we entered into an agreement with the MTA to extend the expiration of our existing contracts for transit advertising services from December 31, 2016, to June 30, 2017, unless earlier terminated by the MTA on 90 days' notice. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business and Operations-The success of our transit advertising business is dependent on obtaining and renewing key municipal contracts on favorable terms.\u201d)\nKey Performance Indicators\nOur management reviews our performance by focusing on the indicators described below.\nSeveral of our key performance indicators are not prepared in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). We believe these non-GAAP performance indicators are meaningful supplemental measures of our operating performance and should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\n\n* Calculation not meaningful.\n (a) Organic revenues exclude revenues associated with significant acquisitions and divestitures, revenues associated with business lines we no longer operate, and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates ( non-organic revenues\u201d). We provide organic revenues to understand the underlying growth rate of revenue excluding the impact of non-organic revenue items. Our management believes organic revenues are useful to users of our financial data because it enables them to better understand the level of growth of our business period to period. Since organic revenues are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, it should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, revenues as an indicator of operating performance. Organic revenues, as we calculate it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. \n (b) See the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d and Revenues\u201d sections of this MD&A for reconciliations of Operating income to Adjusted OIBDA, Net income (loss) to FFO and AFFO and Revenues to organic revenues. \nAdjusted OIBDA\nWe calculate Adjusted OIBDA as Operating income (loss) before Depreciation, Amortization, Net (gain) loss on dispositions, Stock-based compensation, Restructuring charges, Loss on real estate assets held for sale and Acquisition costs. We calculate Adjusted OIBDA margin by dividing Adjusted OIBDA by total revenues. Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA margin are among the primary measures we use for managing our business, evaluating our operating performance and planning and forecasting future periods, as each is an important indicator of our operational strength and business performance. Our management believes users of our financial data are best served if the information that is made available to them allows them to align their analysis and evaluation of our operating results along the same lines that our management uses in managing, planning and executing our business strategy. Our management also believes that the presentations of Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA margin, as supplemental measures, are useful in evaluating our business because eliminating certain non-comparable items highlight operational trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. It is management's opinion that these supplemental measures provide users of our financial data with an important perspective on our operating performance and also make it easier for users of our financial data to compare our results with other companies that have different financing and capital structures or tax rates.\nFFO and AFFO\nWe calculate FFO in accordance with the definition established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d). FFO reflects net income (loss) adjusted to exclude gains and losses from the sale of real estate assets, depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, amortization of direct lease acquisition costs, the non-cash effect of loss on\nreal estate assets held for sale and the same adjustments for our equity-based investments, as well as the related income tax effect of adjustments, as applicable. We calculate AFFO as FFO adjusted to include cash paid for direct lease acquisition costs as such costs are generally amortized over a period ranging from four weeks to one year and therefore are incurred on a regular basis. AFFO also includes cash paid for maintenance capital expenditures since these are routine uses of cash that are necessary for our operations. In addition, AFFO excludes costs related to the Acquisition and restructuring charges, as well as certain non-cash items, including non-real estate depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, accretion expense, the non-cash effect of straight-line rent and amortization of deferred financing costs, and the non-cash portion of income taxes, as well as the related income tax effect of adjustments, as applicable. Our calculation of AFFO was revised in 2016 to adjust for the non-cash portion of income taxes instead of adjusting for current or deferred income taxes, as management believes that this calculation of AFFO is more consistent with AFFO presented by other REITs and analyzed by users of our financial data. This change is reflected in the calculation of AFFO for 2015. We use FFO and AFFO measures for managing our business and for planning and forecasting future periods, and each is an important indicator of our operational strength and business performance, especially compared to other REITs. Our management believes users of our financial data are best served if the information that is made available to them allows them to align their analysis and evaluation of our operating results along the same lines that our management uses in managing, planning and executing our business strategy. Our management also believes that the presentations of FFO, AFFO, and related per weighted average share amounts, as supplemental measures, are useful in evaluating our business because adjusting results to reflect items that have more bearing on the operating performance of REITs highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. It is management's opinion that these supplemental measures provide users of our financial data with an important perspective on our operating performance and also make it easier to compare our results to other companies in our industry, as well as to REITs.\nSince Adjusted OIBDA, Adjusted OIBDA margin, FFO and AFFO and, as applicable, related per weighted average share amounts, are not measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, Operating income (loss), Net income (loss), Revenues and Net income (loss) per common share for basic and diluted earnings per share, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, as indicators of operating performance. These measures, as we calculate them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition, these measures do not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and are not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe following table reconciles Operating income to Adjusted OIBDA, and Net income (loss) to FFO and AFFO.\n\n\n (a) Income tax effect related to Net (gain) loss on dispositions of billboard advertising structures. \n (b) Income tax effect related to Restructuring charges. \nFFO in 2016 of $280.4 million increased 3% compared to 2015, primarily due to higher net income and increased amortization of direct lease acquisition costs, partially offset by a lower loss on real estate assets held for sale in 2016. AFFO in 2016 was $294.5 million, an increase of 10% compared to 2015, primarily due to higher net income, lower maintenance capital expenditures and higher stock-based compensation.\nAnalysis of Results of Operations\nRevenues\nWe derive Revenues primarily from providing advertising space to customers on our advertising structures and sites. Our contracts with customers generally cover periods ranging from four weeks to one year. Revenues from billboard displays are recognized as rental income on a straight-line basis over the contract term. Transit and other revenues are recognized as earned over the contract period. For space provided to advertisers through the use of an advertising agency whose commission is calculated based on a stated percentage of gross advertising spending, our Revenues are reported net of agency commissions.\n2016 vs. 2015\n\n (a) Organic revenues exclude revenues associated with significant acquisitions and divestitures, revenues associated with business lines we no longer operate, and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates ( non-organic revenues\u201d). \n (b) Revenues on a constant dollar basis are calculated as reported revenues excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates between periods. We provide constant dollar revenues to understand the underlying growth rate of revenue excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates between periods, which are not under management's direct control. Our management believes constant dollar revenues are useful to users of our financial data because it enables them to better understand the level of growth of our business period to period. Since constant dollar revenues are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, revenues as an indicator of operating performance. Constant dollar revenues, as we calculate them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. \nTotal revenues increased $0.1 million and organic revenues increased $45.3 million, or 3%, in 2016 compared to 2015. In constant dollars, revenues increased $5.3 million and organic revenues increased $45.3 million, or 3%, in 2016 compared to 2015.\nNon-organic revenues primarily reflect acquisitions and dispositions, and the discontinuation of business lines in 2015.\nTotal billboard revenues decreased $13.3 million, or 1%, in 2016 compared to 2015, principally driven by the impact of the Disposition, the effect of lost billboard leases in 2016, lower performance in Canada, foreign currency exchange losses of $4.6 million and the impact of the disposition of billboard advertising structures in the second quarter of 2015, partially offset by an increase in average revenue per display (yield) and the conversion of traditional static billboard displays to digital billboard displays. In constant dollars, billboard revenues decreased $8.7 million, or 1%, in 2016 compared to 2015.\nTotal transit and other revenues increased $13.4 million, or 3%, in 2016 compared to 2015, driven by stronger market conditions in local advertising, the impact of an acquisition and the net effect of won and lost franchises in 2016, partially offset by lower advertising revenue in the first quarter of 2016 from major sports entertainment events and the impact of the Disposition.\n2015 vs. 2014\n\n* Calculation not meaningful.\n (a) Organic revenues exclude revenues associated with significant acquisitions and divestitures, revenues associated with business lines we no longer operate, and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates ( non-organic revenues\u201d). \n (b) Revenues on a constant dollar basis are calculated as reported revenues excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates between periods. We provide constant dollar revenues to understand the underlying growth rate of revenue excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates between periods, which are not under management's direct control. Our management believes constant dollar revenues are useful to users of our financial data because it enables them to better understand the level of growth of our business year to year. Since constant dollar revenues are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, revenues as an indicator of operating performance. Constant dollar revenues, as we calculate them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. \nTotal revenues increased $160.0 million, or 12%, and organic revenues increased $48.0 million, or 4%, in 2015 compared to 2014. In constant dollars, revenues increased $183.4 million, or 14%, and organic revenues increased $48.0 million, or 4%, in 2015 compared to 2014.\nNon-organic revenues primarily reflect the Acquisition ($194.7 million in 2015 and $55.2 million in 2014), the discontinuation of a business line in April 2014 and other acquisitions and dispositions.\nTotal billboard revenues increased $112.8 million, or 12%, in 2015 compared to 2014, principally driven by the impact of the Acquisition, the conversion of traditional static billboard displays to digital billboard displays and an increase in production and installation revenues, partially offset by a decline in average revenue per display (yield) and the unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of $20.3 million. In constant dollars, billboard revenues increased $133.1 million, or 14%, in 2015 compared to 2014.\nTotal transit and other revenues increased $47.2 million, or 12%, in 2015 compared to 2014, driven by the impact of the Acquisition and stronger market conditions in local and national advertising that increased yield.\nExpenses\n\n * Calculation is not meaningful. \nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses are composed of the following:\nBillboard property lease expenses. These expenses reflect the cost of leasing the real property on which our billboards are mounted. These lease agreements have terms varying between one month and multiple years, and usually provide renewal options. Rental expenses are comprised of a fixed monthly amount and under certain agreements, also include contingent rent, which varies based on the revenues we generate from the leased site. Property leases are generally paid in advance for periods ranging from one to twelve months. The fixed rent is expensed evenly over the contract term and the contingent rent is expensed as incurred when the related revenues are recognized.\nTransit franchise expenses. These expenses reflect costs charged by municipalities and transit operators under transit advertising contracts and are generally calculated based on a percentage of the revenues we generate under the contract, with a minimum guarantee. The costs that are determined based on a percentage of revenues are expensed as incurred when the related revenues are recognized, and the minimum guarantee is expensed over the contract term.\nPosting, maintenance and other site-related expenses. These expenses primarily reflect costs associated with posting and rotation, materials, repairs and maintenance, utilities and property taxes.\n\nBillboard property lease expenses represented 34% of billboard revenues in each of 2016 and 2015, and 30% in 2014. Transit franchise expenses represented 63% of transit revenues in each of 2016 and 2015, and 62% in 2014. Billboard property lease and transit franchise expenses decreased by $1.0 million in 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease in billboard property lease expenses in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to the impact of the Disposition (a decrease of $12.2 million compared to 2015) and lost billboard leases in 2016, partially offset by increases in billboard property lease expenses in our U.S. Media segment. Excluding the impact of the Disposition in 2016, billboard property lease expenses increased 2% in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in transit franchise expenses in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to the increase in transit revenues, partially offset by the impact of the Disposition (a decrease of $3.6 million compared to 2015). Billboard property lease and transit franchise expenses increased by $101.0 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase in billboard property lease expenses in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to the Acquisition. The increase in transit franchise expenses in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to the increase in transit revenues.\nPosting, maintenance and other expenses as a percentage of Revenues were 15% in 2016, 16% in 2015 and 17% in 2014. Posting, maintenance and other expenses decreased $14.0 million, or 6%, in 2016 compared to 2015, principally due to the impact of the Disposition (a decrease of $17.1 million compared to 2015). Excluding the impact of the Disposition, posting, maintenance and other expenses increased 1% in 2016 compared to 2015. Posting, maintenance and other expenses increased $5.6 million, or 2%, in 2015 compared to 2014, principally due to the impact of the Acquisition and higher production and installation costs, which are typically billed to the advertiser and recorded as Revenues, partially offset by a decrease in taxes, posting, materials and utilities expenses, and a favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses ( SG&A\u201d)\nSG&A expenses represented 17% of Revenues in each of 2016, 2015 and 2014. SG&A expenses increased $6.5 million, or 3%, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to increased sales and other compensation-related expenses and one-time professional fees in 2016 of $3.8 million associated with implementing initiatives to improve our cost base and pricing/yield management, partially offset by the impact of the Disposition (a decrease of $11.5 million compared to 2015), lower administrative costs and non-recurring legal expenses in 2015 of $5.2 million. Excluding the impact of the Disposition, SG&A expenses increased 7% in 2016 compared to 2015. SG&A expenses increased $34.0 million, or 15%, in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to the impact of the Acquisition, increased strategic business development expenses of $9.8 million, incremental stand-alone costs of $6.3 million and non-recurring legal expenses of $5.2 million.\nRestructuring Charges\nIn 2016, we recorded restructuring charges of $2.5 million for severance charges associated with the reorganization of our sales management and administrative functions. In 2015, we recorded restructuring charges of $2.6 million associated with the elimination of management positions and the elimination of positions in connection with the sale of assets and the consolidation of leased locations. In 2014, we recorded restructuring charges of $9.8 million associated with the reorganization of management, resulting in the departures of two executive officers. The restructuring charges in 2014 are comprised of severance charges, including stock-based compensation of $5.6 million.\nLoss on Real Estate Assets Held for Sale\nIn connection with the Disposition, the assets of our outdoor advertising business in Latin America had been classified as Assets held for sale on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as of December 31, 2015. It is required that we measure assets held for sale at the lower of their carrying value (including unrecognized foreign currency translation adjustment losses) or fair value less cost to sell. The impact of including unrecognized foreign currency translation adjustment losses in the carrying value of assets held for sale resulted in a non-cash loss on real estate assets held for sale of approximately $103.6 million in 2015. Upon completion of the Disposition in 2016, the unrecognized foreign currency translation adjustment loss was reclassified to earnings from Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.\nNet (Gain) Loss on Dispositions\nNet gain on dispositions was $1.9 million in 2016. Net loss on dispositions was $0.7 million in 2015. Net gain on dispositions in 2014 was $2.5 million and includes a gain of $0.6 million related to the divestiture of a transit shelter operation in the greater Los Angeles area.\nDepreciation\nDepreciation decreased $4.8 million, or 4%, in 2016 compared to 2015, due primarily to the impact of the Disposition, partially offset by higher depreciation associated with the increased number of digital billboards. Both digital and static billboards are depreciated over an estimated useful life of 5 years to 20 years. Depreciation increased $6.5 million, or 6%, in 2015 compared to 2014, due primarily to the impact of the Acquisition and higher depreciation associated with the increased number of digital billboards.\nAmortization\nAmortization decreased $0.1 million in 2016 compared to 2015, principally driven by lower amortization of intangible assets, partially offset by increased direct lease acquisition costs in 2016 compared to 2015. Amortization increased $20.4 million in 2015 compared to 2014, principally driven by amortization related to the intangible assets associated with the Acquisition. Amortization expense includes the amortization of direct lease acquisition costs of $38.2 million in 2016, $36.3 million in 2015 and $33.8 million in 2014. Capitalized direct lease acquisition costs were $38.0 million in 2016, $36.3 million in 2015 and $33.8 million in 2014.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense, net, was $113.8 million (including $6.4 million of deferred financing costs) in 2016, $114.8 million (including $6.3 million of deferred financing costs) in 2015 and $84.8 million (including $12.1 million of deferred financing costs) in 2014.\nBenefit (Provision) for Income Taxes\nIn 2014, as a result of our REIT conversion, substantially all Deferred income tax liabilities, net, was reversed into Net income via a non-cash benefit of approximately $235.6 million. As a result of our REIT conversion, our effective tax rate for the second half of 2014 was substantially lower than previous periods. We believe that the assumptions and estimates used to determine these tax amounts were reasonable. However, the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may not necessarily reflect our income tax expense or tax payments, or what our tax amounts would have been if we had been a stand-alone company operating as a REIT during the periods prior to July 16, 2014, when we were separated from CBS Corporation (the Separation\u201d).\nThe Provision for income taxes was $5.4 million in each of 2016 and 2015 and the Benefit for income taxes in 2014 was $206.0 million, including the reversal of $235.6 million, representing substantially all Deferred income tax liabilities, net, as a result of our REIT conversion. Excluding the Loss on real estate assets held for sale of $103.6 million in 2015 and the non-cash benefit recorded as a result of our REIT conversion in 2014, the effective income tax rate was 5.9% for 2016, 7.2% for 2015 and 30.3% for 2014. As a result of our REIT conversion, our 2016 and 2015 tax rates are substantially lower than 2014.\nNet Income (Loss)\nIn 2016, Net income was $90.9 million compared to a Net loss of $29.4 million in 2015, primarily due to the impact of the Disposition, and a Loss on real estate assets held for sale and non-recurring legal expenses in 2015, partially offset by higher sales and other compensation-related expenses and one-time professional fees in 2016 of $3.8 million associated with implementing initiatives to improve our cost base and pricing/yield management. In 2015, Net loss was $29.4 million compared to Net income of $306.9 million in 2014, primarily due to a Loss on real estate assets held for sale in 2015, the write-off of deferred taxes in 2014 in connection with our conversion to a REIT, the impact of the Acquisition on Revenues, Total expenses and Interest expense, net, increased stand-alone costs, strategic business development expenses and legal expenses, the majority of which were expected to be non-recurring, and increased interest expenses related to the Term Loan (as defined below) and the issuance of $800.0 million of senior unsecured notes on January 31, 2014, partially offset by a lower provision for income taxes as a result of our REIT conversion.\nSegment Results of Operations\nWe present Adjusted OIBDA as the primary measure of profit and loss for our operating segments in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB\u201d) guidance for segment reporting. (See the Key Performance Indicators\u201d section of this MD&A and Item 8., Note 18. Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements.)\nEffective April 1, 2016, we changed the segments that we use to review operating results and make decisions regarding segment performance and resource allocation. Given the changes in our portfolio resulting from the Disposition and recent acquisitions, we made this change to better align our segments with our business strategy. We currently manage our operations through three operating segments-(1) U.S. Billboard and Transit, which is included in our U.S. Media reportable segment, (2) International and (3) Sports Marketing. International and Sports Marketing do not meet the criteria to be a reportable segment and accordingly, are both included in Other. Our new segment reporting therefore includes U.S. Media and Other.\nThe following table presents our Revenues, Adjusted OIBDA, Operating income (loss) and Depreciation and Amortization by segment, in 2016, 2015 and 2014. Historical financial information by reportable segment has been recast to reflect the changes in segment reporting with no impact to previously reported consolidated financial statements. Prior to April 1, 2016, our International segment included our advertising businesses in Canada and Latin America (see Item 8., Note 12. Acquisitions and Dispositions: Dispositions to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Historical operating results for our advertising business in Latin America are included in Other.\n\n (a) `Restructuring charges, costs related to the Acquisition and stock-based compensation are classified as Corporate expenses. \n (b) Restructuring charges for 2014 includes stock-based compensation expenses of $5.6 million. \nU.S. Media\n2016 vs. 2015\n\n * Calculation not meaningful. \n (a) Organic revenues exclude revenues associated with significant acquisitions and divestitures, and revenues associated with business lines we no longer operate ( non-organic revenues\u201d). \nTotal U.S. Media segment revenues increased $49.5 million, or 4%, and U.S. Media segment organic revenues increased $42.0 million, or 3%, in 2016 compared to 2015.\nNon-organic revenues primarily reflect acquisitions and dispositions, and revenues associated with business lines we no longer operate.\nTotal U.S. Media segment revenue grew in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting stronger market conditions in local advertising, an increase in average revenue per display (yield) in billboards, growth attributable to the conversion of traditional static billboard displays to digital billboard displays and the impact of an acquisition, partially offset by the impact of the disposition of billboard advertising structures in the second quarter of 2015, the loss of the New York City phone kiosk contract in the first quarter of 2015, the net impact of won and lost billboard leases and franchises in 2016, and lower advertising revenue in the first quarter of 2016 from major sports entertainment events. We generated approximately 45% in 2016 and 47% in 2015 of our U.S. Media segment revenues from national advertising campaigns.\nRevenues from U.S. Media segment billboards increased $35.8 million, or 4%, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily reflecting stronger market conditions in local advertising, an increase in average revenue per display (yield) and the conversion of traditional static billboard displays to digital billboard displays, partially offset by the impact of lost billboard leases in 2016 and the disposition of billboard advertising structures in the second quarter of 2015.\nOrganic revenues from U.S. Media segment billboards increased $33.2 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to an increase in average revenue per display (yield) and the conversion of traditional static billboard displays to digital billboard displays, partially offset by the impact of lost low-margin billboard leases in 2016.\nTransit and other revenues in the U.S. Media segment increased $13.7 million, or 4%, in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting stronger market conditions in local advertising, the net effect of won and lost franchises in 2016 and the impact of an acquisition, partially offset by lower advertising revenue in the first quarter of 2016 from major sports entertainment events.\nOrganic transit and other revenues in the U.S. Media segment increased $8.8 million, or 2%, in 2016 compared to 2015. This increase was driven by the net effect of won and lost franchises.\nU.S. Media segment operating and SG&A expenses increased $16.9 million and $9.9 million, or 2% and 6%, respectively, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to higher billboard property lease expenses, increased transit franchise expenses resulting from an increase in transit revenues, increased sales and other compensation-related expenses, increased strategic business development expenses of $3.3 million and higher professional fees of $2.4 million, partially offset by lost billboard leases in 2016 and lower administrative costs. In the U.S. Media segment, billboard property lease expenses represented 34% of billboard revenues in each of 2016 and 2015, and transit franchise expenses represented 63% of transit revenues in each of 2016 and 2015.\nU.S. Media segment Adjusted OIBDA increased $22.7 million in 2016 compared to 2015. Adjusted OIBDA margin was 34% in each of 2016 and 2015.\n2015 vs. 2014\n\n * Calculation not meaningful. \n (a) Organic revenues exclude revenues associated with significant acquisitions and divestitures, and revenues associated with business lines we no longer operate ( non-organic revenues\u201d). \nTotal U.S. Media segment revenues increased $181.8 million, or 16%, and U.S. organic revenues increased $46.4 million, or 4%, in 2015 compared to 2014. Non-organic revenues primarily reflect the Acquisition in 2014, the discontinuation of a business line in April 2014 and other acquisitions and dispositions.\nTotal U.S. Media revenue grew in 2015 compared to 2014, reflecting the impact of the Acquisition ($194.7 million), strong local and national revenues in transit, and growth attributable to the conversion of traditional static billboard displays to digital billboard displays, partially offset by a decline in average revenue per display (yield) in billboards. We generated approximately 47% in 2015 and 41% in 2014 of our U.S. Media segment revenues from national advertising campaigns. The increase in the percentages of revenues from national advertising campaigns in 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily due to the impact of the Acquisition.\nRevenues from U.S. Media segment billboards increased $131.4 million, or 16%, in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily reflecting the impact of the Acquisition, the conversion of traditional static billboard displays to digital billboard displays and an increase in production and installation revenues, partially offset by a decline in average revenue per display (yield).\nOrganic revenues from U.S. Media segment billboards increased $2.8 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to the conversion of traditional static billboard displays to digital billboard displays and production and installation revenues, partially offset by a decline in average revenue per display (yield). Sales performance in 2015 compared to 2014 was negatively impacted by proactive organizational changes in certain markets.\nTransit and other revenues in the U.S. Media segment increased $50.4 million, or 16%, in 2015 compared to 2014, reflecting the impact of the Acquisition and stronger market conditions in local and national advertising for transit that increased yield.\nOrganic revenues from U.S. Media segment transit and other increased $43.6 million, or 14%, in 2015 compared to 2014. This increase was driven by increased advertiser demand for transit displays as reflected by an increase in average revenue per display (yield).\nU.S. Media segment operating and SG&A expenses increased $119.5 million and $20.4 million, or 20% and 14%, respectively, in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to the impact of the Acquisition, higher transit franchise expenses due to the increase in transit revenues compared to the corresponding prior-year period, increased compensation-related expenses and increased strategic business development expenses. In the U.S. Media segment, billboard property lease expenses represented 34% of billboard revenues in 2015 and 30% of billboard revenues in 2014, and transit franchise expenses represented 63% of transit revenues in 2015 and 64% of transit revenues in 2014.\nU.S. Media segment Adjusted OIBDA increased $41.9 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to the impact of the Acquisition. Adjusted OIBDA margin decreased to 34% in 2015 from 35% in 2014.\nOther\n2016 vs. 2015\n\n * Calculation is not meaningful. \n (a) Revenues on a constant dollar basis are calculated as reported revenues excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates between periods. \nTotal Other revenues decreased $49.4 million, or 29%, in 2016 compared to 2015. In constant dollars, total Other revenues in 2016 decreased 27% compared to 2015, driven by the impact of the Disposition (a decrease of $47.5 million) and lower performance in Canada of 3%, partially offset by stronger results in our Sports Marketing operating segment.\nOther operating expenses decreased $31.9 million, or 29%, in 2016 compared to 2015, driven by the impact of the Disposition (a decrease of $32.9 million), partially offset by higher expenses related to our Sports Marketing operating segment. Other SG&A expenses decreased $11.0 million, or 32%, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily driven by the impact of the Disposition (a decrease of $11.2 million), foreign currency exchange rates and lower expenses in Canada, partially offset by higher expenses related to our Sports Marketing operating segment.\nOther Adjusted OIBDA decreased $6.5 million, or 27%, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily driven by the impact of the Disposition and lower performance in Canada. In constant dollars, Other Adjusted OIBDA decreased $6.6 million, or 27%, in 2016 compared to 2015.\n2015 vs. 2014\n\n * Calculation is not meaningful. \n (a) Revenues on a constant dollar basis are calculated as reported revenues excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates between periods. \nTotal Other revenues decreased $21.8 million, or 11%, in 2015 compared to 2014, reflecting the negative impact of foreign exchange rates. In constant dollars, total Other revenues increased 1% in 2015 compared to 2014, driven by an increase in Canada and Latin America.\nOther operating expenses decreased $12.9 million, or 10%, in 2015 compared to 2014, driven by the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by an increase in billboard property lease costs and higher posting, maintenance and other expenses in Latin America. Other SG&A expenses decreased $1.9 million, or 5%, in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily driven by the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by higher compensation-related expenses and professional fees.\nOther Adjusted OIBDA decreased $7.0 million, or 22%, in 2015 compared to 2014, driven by higher expenses. In constant dollars, Other Adjusted OIBDA decreased $3.2 million, or 12%, in 2015 compared to 2014.\nCorporate\nCorporate expenses primarily include expenses associated with employees who provide centralized services. Corporate expenses, excluding restructuring charges, costs related to the Acquisition and stock-based compensation, were $42.6 million in 2016, $37.8 million in 2015 and $27.1 million in 2014. The increase in corporate expenses in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily reflects increased compensation-related expenses and one-time professional fees in 2016 of $3.8 million associated with implementing initiatives to improve our cost base and pricing/yield management, partially offset by non-recurring legal expenses in 2015 of $5.2 million. The increase in corporate expenses in 2015 compared to 2014 reflect incremental stand-alone costs of $6.3 million, non-recurring legal expenses of $5.2 million, and increased strategic business development expenses of $4.1 million, partially offset by decreases in compensation expense.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\n * Calculation is not meaningful. \nWe continually project anticipated cash requirements for our operating, investing and financing needs as well as cash flows generated from operating activities available to meet these needs. Due to seasonal advertising patterns and influences on advertising markets, our revenues and operating income are typically highest in the fourth quarter, during the holiday shopping season, and lowest in the first quarter, as advertisers cut back on spending following the holiday shopping season. Further, some of our municipal transit contracts, as well as our marketing and multimedia rights agreements with colleges and universities, require guaranteed minimum annual payments to be paid at the beginning of the year.\nOur short-term cash requirements primarily include payments for operating leases, guaranteed minimum annual payments, capital expenditures, interest and dividends. Funding for short-term cash needs will come primarily from our cash on hand, operating cash flows and borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) or other secured credit facilities that we may establish.\nIn addition, as part of our growth strategy, we frequently evaluate strategic opportunities to acquire new businesses, assets or digital technology. Consistent with this strategy, we regularly evaluate potential acquisitions, ranging from small transactions to larger acquisitions, which transactions could be funded through cash on hand, additional borrowings, equity or other securities, or some combination thereof.\nOur long-term cash needs include principal payments on outstanding indebtedness. Funding for long-term cash needs will come from our cash on hand, operating cash flows, our ability to issue debt and equity securities, and borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility or other secured credit facilities that we may establish.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had net indebtedness of approximately $2.1 billion.\nOn February 22, 2017, we announced that our board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.36 per share on our common stock, payable on March 31, 2017, to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 10, 2017.\nDebt\nLong-term debt, net, consists of the following:\n\n (a) See Item 8., Note 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: Adoption of New Accounting Standards to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nTerm Loan\nThe interest rate on the term loan due in 2021 (the Term Loan\u201d) was 3.0% per annum as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, a discount of $1.0 million on the Term Loan remains unamortized. The discount is being amortized through Interest expense, net, on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nDuring 2016, we made aggregate discretionary payments of $90.0 million on the Term Loan.\nSenior Unsecured Notes\nAs of December 31, 2016, a discount of $0.5 million on $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 5.250% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2022, remains unamortized. The discount is being amortized through Interest expense, net, on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nAs of December 31, 2016, a premium of $3.0 million on $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 5.625% Senior Unsecured Notes, due 2024, remains unamortized. The premium is being amortized through Interest expense, net, on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nWe have a $425.0 million Revolving Credit Facility, which matures in 2019 (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d).\nAs of December 31, 2016, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nThe commitment fee based on the amount of unused commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility was $1.8 million in 2016 and $1.9 million in each of 2015 and 2014. As of December 31, 2016, we had issued letters of credit totaling approximately $31.7 million against the Revolving Credit Facility.\nDebt Covenants\nThe credit agreement dated January 31, 2014 (the Credit Agreement\u201d), governing the Term Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility, and the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes contain customary affirmative and negative covenants, subject to certain exceptions, including but not limited to those that limit the Company's and our subsidiaries' abilities to (i) pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect to the Company's or its wholly-owned subsidiary, Outfront Media Capital LLC's capital stock or make other restricted payments other than dividends or distributions necessary for us to maintain our REIT status, subject to certain conditions, and (ii) enter into agreements restricting certain subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany transfers.\nThe terms of the Credit Agreement require that, as long as any commitments remain outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, we maintain a Consolidated Net Secured Leverage Ratio, which is the ratio of (i) our consolidated secured debt (less up to $150.0 million of unrestricted cash) to (ii) our Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for the trailing four consecutive quarters, of no greater than 4.0 to 1.0. As of December 31, 2016, our Consolidated Net Secured Leverage Ratio was 1.3 to 1.0, as adjusted for the non-cash loss on real estate assets held for sale related to the Disposition and to give pro forma effect to acquisitions and dispositions, in accordance with the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement also requires that, in connection with the incurrence of certain indebtedness, we maintain a Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, which is the ratio of our consolidated total debt to our Consolidated EBITDA for the trailing four consecutive quarters, of no greater than 6.0 to 1.0. As of December 31, 2016, our Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio was 4.7 to 1.0, as adjusted for the non-cash loss on real estate assets held for sale related to the Disposition and to give pro forma effect to acquisitions and dispositions, in accordance with the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2016, we are in compliance with our debt covenants.\nLetter of Credit Facility\nEffective January 31, 2017, we completed the bifurcation process of our letter of credit facility between two institutions for administrative purposes. As of February 23, 2017, our letter of credit facilities totaled $80.0 million.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we issued letters of credit totaling approximately $68.0 million under our aggregate letter of credit facilities. The fees under the letter of credit facility in 2016, 2015 and 2014 were immaterial.\nDeferred Financing Costs\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had deferred $26.9 million in fees and expenses associated with the Term Loan, Revolving Credit Facility, letter of credit facility and our senior unsecured notes. We are amortizing the deferred fees through Interest expense, net, on the Consolidated Statement of Operations over the respective terms of the Term Loan, Revolving Credit Facility, letter of credit facility and our senior unsecured notes.\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth our cash flows in 2016, 2015 and 2014.\n\n * Calculation is not meaningful. \nCash provided by operating activities decreased $6.0 million in 2016 compared to 2015, due primarily to the timing of interest payments on our debt and the timing of commissions and other expense payments, partially offset by higher net income, as adjusted for non-cash items. Cash provided by operating activities increased $30.3 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to higher net income, as adjusted for non-cash items, resulting from the impact of the Acquisition and lower income taxes due to our REIT conversion. This was partially offset by an increased use of working capital driven by an increase in accounts\nreceivable and decreases in accounts payables and accrued expenses. These working capital increases were offset by lower cash paid for income taxes.\nAfter the Separation, we began operating as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Actual cash payments for income taxes were $1.2 million in 2016, $5.8 million in 2015 and $53.0 million in 2014, including payments made to CBS Corporation ( CBS\u201d).\nCash used for investing activities decreased $25.7 million in 2016 compared to 2015 and decreased $736.0 million in 2015 compared to 2014. In 2016, we completed several small acquisitions for a total purchase price of approximately $67.9 million, incurred $59.4 million in capital expenditures and received $90.6 million in proceeds from dispositions, primarily related to the Disposition. In 2015, we completed several small acquisitions for a total purchase price of approximately $12.1 million, incurred $59.2 million in capital expenditures and received $8.9 million in proceeds from dispositions, primarily related to the disposition of substantially all of our assets in Puerto Rico. In 2014, we completed the Acquisition for a total purchase price of approximately $714.2 million (including working capital adjustments), completed several smaller acquisitions for a total purchase price of approximately $19.6 million, incurred $64.2 million in capital expenditures and made an investment of $3.0 million in Videri Inc. in connection with licenses and services to be received under a development and license agreement with Videri Inc. and its affiliate, and received $4.5 million in proceeds from dispositions.\nThe following table presents our capital expenditures in 2016, 2015 and 2014.\n\nCapital expenditures increased $0.2 million in 2016 compared to 2015, driven by installation of the most current LED lighting technology to improve the quality and extend the life of our static billboards and an increase in digital display spending, partially offset by decreased expenditures related to the Disposition and the renovation of certain office facilities. Capital expenditures decreased $5.0 million, or 8%, in 2015 compared to 2014, driven by a decline in digital display spending, partially offset by increased investments in information technology and expenditures to renovate certain office facilities.\nFor the full year of 2017, we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately $65.0 million to $70.0 million, which will be used primarily for growth in digital displays, installation of the most current LED lighting technology to improve the quality and extend the life of our static billboards, billboard maintenance and to renovate certain office facilities.\nCash used for financing activities increased $137.9 million in 2016 compared 2015. Cash provided by financing activities was $536.6 million in 2014. In 2016, we paid cash dividends of $188.6 million and made discretionary payments totaling $90.0 million on the Term Loan. In 2015, we paid cash dividends $196.3 million, prepaid $50.0 million on the Term Loan and incurred debt, including a premium, of $103.8 million. In 2014, we incurred debt of $600.0 million related to the Acquisition on October 1, 2014, retained $100.0 million related to our IPO, retained $50.0 million related to the incurrence of $1.6 billion of indebtedness on January 31, 2014, received $49.3 million of net capital contributions from CBS and paid cash dividends of $242.7 million.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2016, our significant contractual obligations and payments due by period were as follows:\n\n (a) We have agreements with municipalities and transit operators which entitle us to operate advertising displays within their transit systems, including on the interior and exterior of rail and subway cars and buses, as well as on benches, transit shelters, street kiosks, and transit platforms. Under most of these franchise agreements, the franchisor is entitled to receive the greater of a percentage of the relevant revenues, net of agency fees, or a specified guaranteed minimum annual payment. Franchise rights are generally paid monthly, or in some cases upfront at the beginning of the year. \n (b) We also have marketing and multimedia rights agreements with colleges, universities and other educational institutions, which entitle us to operate on-campus advertising displays, as well as manage marketing opportunities, media rights and experiential entertainment at sports events. Under most of these agreements, the school is entitled to receive the greater of a percentage of the relevant revenue, net of agency commissions, or a specified guaranteed minimum annual payment. \n (c) Consists of non-cancellable operating leases with terms in excess of one year for billboard sites, office space and equipment. Total future minimum payments of $995.0 million include $955.6 million for our billboard sites. Excludes rent on cancellable leases and leases with terms of under one year, as well as contingent rent. (See Item 8, Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about our contractual obligations.) \n (d) As of December 31, 2016, we had long-term debt of approximately $2.2 billion. Interest on the Term Loan is variable. For illustrative purposes, we are assuming an interest rate of 3.0% for all years, which reflects the interest rate as of December 31, 2016. An increase or decrease of 1/4% in the interest rate will change the annual interest expense by $1.7 million. \nThe above table excludes $0.6 million of reserves for uncertain tax positions and the related accrued interest and penalties, as we cannot reasonably predict the amount of and timing of cash payments related to this obligation.\nIn 2017, we expect to contribute $2.0 million to our pension plans. Contributions to our pension plans were $2.0 million in each of 2016 and 2015, and $1.6 million in 2014.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOur off-balance sheet commitments primarily consist of operating lease arrangements and guaranteed minimum annual payments. (See Item 8, Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our off-balance sheet commitments.)\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions.\nWe consider the following accounting policies to be the most critical as they are significant to its financial condition and results of operations, and require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in their application. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, see Item 8., Note 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGoodwill\nWe test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis on October 31 of each year and between annual tests should factors or indicators become apparent that would require an interim test. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting-unit level. We elected to perform the two-step quantitative impairment test in 2016.\nThe first step of the goodwill impairment test examines whether the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. We compute the estimated fair value of each reporting unit by adding the present value of the estimated annual cash flows over a discrete projection period to the residual value of the business at the end of the projection period. This technique requires us to use significant estimates and assumptions such as growth rates, operating margins, capital expenditures and discount rates. The estimated growth rates, operating margins and capital expenditures for the projection period are based on our internal forecasts of future performance as well as historical trends. The residual value is estimated based on a perpetual nominal growth rate, which is based on projected long-range inflation and long-term industry projections. The discount rates are determined based on the weighted average cost of capital of comparable entities. A downward revision of these assumptions would decrease the fair values of our reporting units.\nIf the fair value of a reporting unit falls below its carrying value, excluding any impacts from foreign currency translation adjustments reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Statement Financial Position in conformity with GAAP, we would then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of any non-cash impairment charge. Such a charge could have a material effect on the statement of operations and statement of financial position.\nLong-Lived Assets\nWe report long-lived assets, including billboard advertising structures, other property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. We depreciate or amortize these assets over their estimated useful lives, which generally range from five to 40 years. For billboard advertising structures, we estimate the useful lives based on the estimated economic life of the asset. Transit fixed assets are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the related contractual term. Our long-lived identifiable intangible assets primarily consist of acquired permits and leasehold agreements and franchise agreements, which grant us the right to operate out-of-home advertising structures in specified locations and the right to provide advertising displays on railroad and municipal transit properties. Our long-lived identifiable intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which is the respective life of the agreement and in some cases includes an estimation for renewals, which is based on historical experience.\nLong-lived assets subject to depreciation and amortization are also reviewed for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the long-lived asset might be impaired, by comparing the forecasted undiscounted cash flows to be generated by those assets to the carrying values of those assets. The significant assumptions we use to determine the useful lives and fair values of long-lived assets include contractual commitments, regulatory requirements, future expected cash flows and industry growth rates, as well as future salvage values.\nLong-lived assets are assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted cash flows generated by those assets to the respective asset's carrying value, excluding any impacts from foreign currency translation adjustments reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Statement Financial Position in conformity with GAAP. The amount of impairment loss, if any, will be measured by the difference between the net carrying value and the estimated fair value of the asset and recognized as a non-cash charge. Long-lived assets held for sale are required to be measured at the lower of their carrying value (including unrecognized foreign currency translation adjustment losses) or fair value less cost to sell.\nAsset Retirement Obligation\nWe record an asset retirement obligation for our estimated future legal obligation, upon termination or nonrenewal of a lease, associated with removing structures from the leased property and, when required by the contract, the cost to return the leased property to its original condition. These obligations are recorded at their present value in the period in which the liability is incurred and are capitalized as part of the related assets' carrying value. Accretion of the liability is recognized in operating expenses and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the expected useful life of the related asset. The obligation is calculated based on the assumption that all of our advertising structures will be removed within the next 50 years. The significant assumptions used in estimating the asset retirement obligation include the cost of removing the asset, the cost of remediating the leased property to its original condition where required and the timing and number of lease renewals, all of which are estimated based on historical experience.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method of accounting. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nOn July 17, 2014, we began operating as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As long as we remain qualified to be taxed as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our REIT taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify to be taxed as a REIT in any taxable year and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates and will be precluded from re-electing to be taxed as a REIT for the subsequent four taxable years following the year during which we lose our REIT qualification. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income or property, and the income of our TRSs will be subject to taxation at regular corporate rates. Our qualification to be taxed as a REIT will depend upon our ability to meet on a continuing basis, through actual investment and operating results, various complex requirements under the Code, related to, among other things, the sources of our gross income, the composition and values of our assets, our distribution levels and the diversity of ownership of our shares. We believe we are organized in conformity with these requirements and that our manner of operation will enable us to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT. (See Item 1. Business-Tax Status.\u201d)\nAs a REIT, we must distribute to our stockholders, at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain. To the extent that we satisfy the 90% distribution requirement, but distribute less than 100% of our taxable income, we will be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on the undistributed income. In addition, we would be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which our distributions in any calendar year are less than a minimum amount specified under U.S. federal income tax laws. We intend to pay regular quarterly distributions to our stockholders in an amount not less than 100% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for dividends paid).\nPrior to July 17, 2014, we were a member of CBS's consolidated tax group, and the provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and income tax payments were calculated on a separate tax return basis. These amounts may not necessarily reflect the income tax expense or tax payments that would have been reported if we had been operating as a stand-alone company, and would not reflect what our income tax expense or tax payments would have been as a REIT during the periods prior to the Separation. We believe that the assumptions and estimates used to determine these tax amounts were reasonable.\nAccounting Standards\nSee Item 8., Note 3.

from an annual report Form 10-K filing, specifically focusing on Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) for OUTFRONT Media. The following is a concise summary of the key points:\n\n**Overview:**\nOUTFRONT Media is a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) involved in providing advertising space on out-of-home structures in the United States and Canada. Its portfolio includes billboards, transit displays, and digital billboards, particularly in high-profile locations. The company operates through three segments: U.S. Billboard and Transit, International, and Sports Marketing.\n\n**Financial Analysis:**\n- The U.S. Media segment is the primary revenue generator, especially from the New York City and Los Angeles markets.\n- The International and Sports Marketing segments are grouped under \"Other\" due to their smaller scale.\n- Revenue generation is sensitive to economic conditions and advertising spending patterns, and the industry is characterized by competition from various other media platforms.\n- There is a strategic focus on digital billboard displays, which generate more revenue and profitability than traditional static displays.\n\n**Operations:**\n- The company has predominantly lease agreements for advertising space, with a significant portion of revenue coming from nationwide campaigns.\n- There are considerable expenses associated with billboard and transit leases, operations, and installations.\n\n**Financial Position:**\n- The company's financial results have been impacted by acquisitions and dispositions, including the sale of Latin America operations in 2016.\n- Revenue increased marginally by $0.1 million in 2016 compared to 2015, but organic revenues grew 3%.\n- Operating income improved significantly from $86.4 million in 2015 to $204.9 million in 2016.\n- OUTFRONT Media has diversified customers, with the largest categories of advertisers being retail, television, and healthcare/pharmaceuticals.\n\n**Economic Environment:**\n- The company's business performance is influenced by economic cycles, with higher profits in the fourth quarter and lower performance after the holiday season.\n- The largest market segments remained consistent over recent years, primarily driven by retail, television, and healthcare/pharmaceuticals.\n\n**Business Environment:**\n- Competition within the out-of-home advertising industry includes several large national companies as well as numerous smaller regional and local firms.\n- There are also competitive pressures from online, mobile, social media, and traditional media advertising platforms.\n\n**Debt and Financing:**\n- The company has a sizable debt obligation, with terms outlined within their credit agreements, maintaining certain leverage ratios, and standard industry financing structures. They have a significant amount of long-term debt maturing in the future and require compliance with financial covenants.\n\n**Cash Flows:**\n- The company's cash flow from operations experienced a slight decrease from 2015 to 2016, while cash used for investing activities and cash used for financing activities varied in recent years largely due to capital expenditures and dividend payments.\n\n**Accounting Policies:**\n- Critical accounting policies include the treatment of goodwill, long-lived assets, accounting for income taxes, and the recognition of asset retirement obligations. These policies require significant management judgment and estimates.\n\n**Accounting Standards:**\n- Adoption of new accounting standards and recent accounting pronouncement impacts have been highlighted, indicating changes in financial reporting methods.\n\nThis MD&A section emphasizes forward-looking statements subject to risks, uncertainties, and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated or implied by such statements. For an accurate understanding, these discussions should be read in conjunction with the company\u2019s financial statements and notes."}
