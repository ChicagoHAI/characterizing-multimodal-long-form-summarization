MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIntroduction\nWe are an innovative media company serving the greater good of our communities. Across platforms, we tell empowering stories, conduct impactful investigations and deliver innovative marketing services. With 64 television stations and two radio stations in 51 U.S. markets, we are the largest owner of top four network affiliates in the top 25 markets among independent station groups, reaching approximately 39% of U.S. television households. We also own leading multicast networks True Crime Network, Twist and Quest. Each television station also has a robust digital presence across online, mobile and social platforms, reaching consumers on all devices and platforms they use to consume news content. We have been consistently honored with the industry's top awards, including Edward R. Murrow, George Polk, Alfred I. DuPont and Emmy Awards. Through TEGNA Marketing Solutions (TMS), our integrated sales and back-end fulfillment operations, we deliver results for advertisers across television, digital and over-the-top (OTT) platforms, including Premion, our OTT advertising network.\nWe have one operating and reportable segment. The primary sources of our revenues are: 1) subscription revenues, reflecting fees paid by satellite, cable, OTT (companies that deliver video content to consumers over the Internet) and telecommunications providers to carry our television signals on their systems; 2) advertising & marketing services (AMS) revenues, which include local and national non-political television advertising, digital marketing services (including Premion), and advertising on stations' websites, tablet and mobile products and OTT apps; 3) political advertising revenues, which are driven by even-year election cycles at the local and national level (e.g., 2022, 2020. etc.) and particularly in the second half of those years; and 4) other services, such as production of programming, tower rentals and distribution of our local news content.\nOn February 22, 2022, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Parent, Merger Sub, and solely for purposes of certain provisions specified therein, other subsidiaries of Parent, certain affiliates Standard General and CMG and certain of its subsidiaries. We currently expect the transaction, which is subject to stockholder and regulatory approvals, and other customary closing conditions, to close in the second half of 2022. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d and Note 12 - Subsequent Event of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this report.\nCOVID-19 pandemic\nSince early 2020, the world has been, and continues to be, impacted by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and its variants. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges including widespread economic and social change throughout the United States. The U.S. economy continued on a path to recovery during 2021 with millions of Americans receiving COVID-19 vaccines, states/municipalities increasingly reopening and continued growth in employment. In addition, the U.S. federal government continued to enact policies to provide fiscal stimulus to the economy and relief to those affected by the pandemic, with the stimulus bolstering household finances as well as those of small businesses, states and municipalities. Our AMS revenues were most negatively impacted by the pandemic early in the second quarter of 2020 but since then AMS revenues have improved significantly as economic re-opening accelerated.\nThe impact of COVID-19 and the extent of its adverse impact on our financial and operating results will be dictated by the degree to which the pandemic continues to affect our advertising customers. This will depend on future pandemic-related developments including the severity of COVID-19 variants, disruptions to our customers' supply chains and impacts to their advertising and marketing purchasing patterns, the effectiveness, distribution and acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines and booster shots, consumer confidence, and U.S. government actions to prevent and manage the virus spread, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. While we use the best information available in developing significant estimates included in our financial statements, the effects of the pandemic on our operations may not be fully realized, or reflected in our financial results, until future periods. As such, actual results could differ from our estimates and these differences resulting from changes in facts and circumstances could be material.\nSeasonality: Our revenues and operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations. Generally, our second and fourth quarter operating results are stronger than those of the first and third quarter. This is driven by the second quarter reflecting increased spring seasonal advertising, while the fourth quarter typically includes increased advertising related to the holiday season. In addition, our revenue and operating results are subject to significant fluctuations across yearly periods resulting from political advertising. In even numbered years, political spending is usually significantly higher than in odd numbered years due to advertising for the local and national elections. Additionally, every four years, we typically experience even greater increases in political advertising in connection with the presidential election. The strong demand for advertising from political advertisers in these even years can result in the significant use of our available inventory (leading to a crowd out\u201d effect), which can diminish our AMS revenue in the even year of a two year election cycle, particularly in the fourth quarter of those years.\nConsolidated Results from Operations\nThe following discussion is a comparison of our consolidated results on a GAAP basis. The year-to-year comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of future results. In addition, see the section on page 32 titled \u2018Operating results non-GAAP information' for additional tables presenting information which supplements our financial information provided on a GAAP basis.\nAs discussed above, our operating results are subject to significant fluctuations across yearly periods (driven by even-year election cycles). As such, in addition to one year ago comparisons, our management team and Board of Directors also review current period operating results compared to the same period two years ago (e.g., 2021 vs. 2019). We believe this comparison will also provide useful information to investors, and therefore, we have supplemented our prior year comparison of consolidated results to also include a comparison against 2019 results (through operating income).\nDuring 2019, we acquired multiple local television stations and multicast networks. Specifically, we acquired certain stations divested by Gray (January 2, 2019), the Justice Network (rebranded as True Crime Network) and Quest multicast networks (June 18, 2019), the Dispatch stations (August 8, 2019) and certain stations divested by Nexstar (September 19, 2019). The multicast networks, Dispatch stations, and Nexstar stations are collectively referred to as the 2019 Acquisitions\u201d in the discussion that follows. These 2019 Acquisitions did not contribute to the periods prior to their acquisition in our financial statements which impacts 2021 to 2019 comparability of our consolidated operating results. The Gray stations do not impact the 2021 to 2019 comparability.\nFor a comparative discussion of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, see Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on March 1, 2021.\nA consolidated summary of our results is presented below (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change from 2020\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change from 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues: </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,991,093 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,937,780 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,299,497 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenues </td> <td>1,598,759 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,503,287 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6% </td> <td> </td> <td>1,228,237 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Business units -

The net increase was primarily due to $253.3 million growth in AMS reflecting higher demand for television and digital advertising, year over year. Growth in subscription revenue of $179.8 million was primarily due to annual rate increases under existing and newly renegotiated retransmission agreements, partially offset by declines in subscribers including the impact of an outage with a broadcast satellite provider that began on October 6, 2021 and ended in early 2022. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in political revenue of $385.0 million, following the 2020 presidential election year.\n2021 vs. 2019\nTotal revenues increased $691.6 million in 2021. Our 2019 Acquisitions contributed $306.2 million to this increase. Excluding the 2019 Acquisitions, total revenues increased $385.4 million. This increase was primarily due to a $303.5 million increase in legacy subscription revenue from annual rate increases under existing and newly renegotiated retransmission agreements, partially offset by declines in subscribers including the impact of an outage with a broadcast satellite provider that began on October 6, 2021 and ended in early 2022. Also contributing to the increase was a $51.5 million increase in AMS revenue, driven in part by Premion, and a $21.9 million increase in political advertising revenue.\nCost of revenues\n2021 vs. 2020\nCost of revenues increased $95.5 million in 2021. This increase was primarily due to a $72.8 million growth in programming costs driven by a contractual increase in rates under existing and newly renegotiated affiliation agreements and growth in subscription revenues (certain programming costs are linked to such revenues). Higher digital expenses of $7.6 million driven by growth in Premion also contributed to the increase.\n2021 vs. 2019\nCost of revenues increased $370.5 million in 2021. Our 2019 Acquisitions contributed $164.5 million to this increase. Excluding the 2019 Acquisitions, cost of revenues increased $206.0 million. This increase was primarily due to a $179.2 million increase in programming costs driven by a contractual increase in rates under existing and newly renegotiated affiliation agreements and growth in subscription revenues (certain programming costs are linked to such revenues). Higher digital expenses of $12.6 million driven by growth in Premion also contributed to the increase.\nBusiness units - Selling, general and administrative expenses\n2021 vs. 2020\nBusiness unit selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased $30.8 million in 2021. The increase was primarily due to a $13.9 million increase in legal and professional fees. Marketing costs also rose $8.0 million. Sales commissions and other selling costs also increased by $23.1 million driven by growth in AMS revenues. These increases were partially offset by a $8.7 million reduction in bad debt expense attributed to improved collections.\n2021 vs. 2019\nBusiness unit SG&A expenses increased $69.6 million in 2021. Our 2019 Acquisitions added business unit SG&A expenses of $32.9 million. Excluding the 2019 Acquisitions, SG&A expenses increased $36.7 million. The increase was primarily the result of a $20.6 million increase in legal and professional fees. Sales commissions and other selling costs increased by $18.0 million driven by growth in AMS revenues. Stock based compensation expense was also higher by $3.9 million, driven by our higher stock price.\nCorporate - General and administrative expenses\nOur corporate costs are separated from our direct business expenses and are recorded as general and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Income. This category primarily consists of corporate management and support functions including Legal, Human Resources, and Finance, as well as activities and costs not directly attributable to the operations of our media business.\n2021 vs. 2020\nCorporate general and administrative expenses decreased $5.2 million in 2021. The decrease was primarily driven by a $6.5 million reduction in advisory fees related to activism defense, and reduction of $0.9 million of M&A-related costs. Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in stock based compensation expense of $2.2 million driven by our higher stock price.\n2021 vs. 2019\nCorporate general and administrative expenses decreased $12.0 million in 2021. The decrease was primarily due to the absence of acquisition-related costs of $30.8 million due to the reduction in acquisition activity in 2021. Partially offsetting this decrease were increases of $10.5 million in advisory fees related to activism defense, $3.7 million in M&A-related costs and $1.8 million in stock based compensation expense due to our higher stock price.\nDepreciation expense\n2021 vs. 2020\nDepreciation expense decreased $2.0 million in 2021 due to a decline in capital expenditures resulting in less depreciation in 2021 as fewer new assets were placed in service.\n2021 vs. 2019\nDepreciation expense increased $4.3 million in 2021 driven by our 2019 Acquisitions which contributed $8.0 million to the increase. Excluding the impact of 2019 Acquisitions, depreciation expense decreased $3.7 million due to a decline in capital expenditures following the onset of COVID-19, resulting in less depreciation in 2021 as fewer new assets were placed in service.\nAmortization of intangible assets\n2021 vs. 2020\nIntangible asset amortization expense decreased $4.7 million in 2021. The decrease is due to certain assets reaching the end of their assumed useful lives and therefore becoming fully amortized.\n2021 vs. 2019\nIntangible asset amortization expense increased $12.9 million in 2021. Our 2019 Acquisitions contributed $23.1 million to this increase. Excluding the impact of the 2019 Acquisitions, amortization expense decreased $10.2 million due to certain assets reaching the end of their assumed useful lives.\nSpectrum repacking reimbursements and other, net\n2021 vs. 2020\nWe had other net gains of $2.3 million in 2021 compared to net gains of $10.0 million in 2020. The 2021 activity is related to $4.9 million of reimbursements received from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for required spectrum repacking, partially offset by a $1.5 million contract termination fee and a $1.1 million write off of certain assets. The 2020 net gains primarily consisted of $13.2 million of reimbursements received from the FCC for required spectrum repacking, partially offset by a $2.1 million impairment charge due to the retirement of a brand name and a $1.1 million FCC license impairment charge.\n2021 vs. 2019\nWe had other net gains of $2.3 million in 2021 compared to net gains of $5.3 million in 2019. The 2021 activity consists of the items discussed above. The 2019 net gains consisted of gains of $17.0 million of reimbursements received from the FCC for required spectrum repacking and a gain of $2.9 million as a result of the sale of certain real estate. These gains were partially offset by a $5.5 million in contract termination charge and transition costs related to bringing our national sales organization in-house and $9.1 million of non-cash charges to reduce the value of certain assets classified as held-for-sale.\nOperating income\n2021 vs. 2020\nOur operating income decreased $68.8 million in 2021. This decrease was driven by the changes in revenue and expenses discussed above, but primarily due to a decline in high-margin political revenue.\n2021 vs. 2019\nOperating income increased $243.2 million in 2021. Results from our 2019 Acquisitions added operating income of $77.8 million. Excluding the 2019 Acquisitions, operating income increased $165.4 million, driven by the changes in revenue and expenses discussed above, most notably the increases in subscription revenue.\nProgramming and payroll expense trends\nProgramming and payroll expenses are the two largest elements of our operating expenses, and are summarized below, expressed as a percentage of total operating expenses. Programming expenses as a percentage of total operating expenses have increased due to an increase in reverse compensation payments to our network affiliation partners. Payroll expenses have increased during 2021, but as a percentage of total operating expenses have decreased in 2021 primarily due to increases in programming expenses, which make up a larger percentage of operating costs.\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Percentage of total operating expenses </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expense Category </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Programming expenses </td> <td>41.2% </td> <td> </td> <td>40.1% </td> <td> </td> <td>35.5% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payroll expenses </td> <td>25.8% </td> <td> </td> <td>26.7% </td> <td> </td> <td>28.6% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-operating income and expense\nEquity income: This income statement category reflects earnings or losses from our equity method investments. Equity income decreased from $10.4 million in 2020 to a loss of $9.7 million in 2021. The 2021 loss was primarily due to equity loss from our CareerBuilder investment. The 2020 income was primarily due to equity income from our CareerBuilder investment (recognizing gains driven by the sale of several subsidiary businesses).\nInterest expense: Interest expense decreased $24.6 million in 2021 as compared to 2020, primarily due to a lower average outstanding total debt balance, partially offset by higher interest rates. The total average outstanding debt was $3.41 billion in 2021 compared to $4.02 billion in 2020. The impact of the decrease in outstanding debt was partially offset by an increase in the weighted average interest rate on total outstanding debt, which was 5.15% in 2021 compared to 5.03% in 2020.\nA further discussion of our borrowing and related interest cost is presented in the Liquidity and capital resources\u201d section of this report beginning on page 36 and in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.\nOther non-operating items, net: Other non-operating items increased $40.9 million from a net loss of $34.0 million in 2020 to a net income of $6.8 million in 2021. This change was comprised of 2020 charges absent in 2021 including a $17.3 million call premium related to the repayment of our 2023 and 2024 unsecured senior notes; and acceleration of $11.8 million of previously deferred financing fees associated with early repayment of unsecured senior notes. In addition, the increase was driven by the absence of a $9.2 million impairment of an equity investment in 2020.\nProvision for income taxes\nWe reported pre-tax income of $613.7 million for 2021. The effective tax rate on pre-tax income was 22.1%. The 2021 effective tax rate decreased compared to 24.2% in 2020 primarily due to tax benefits realized as a result of state tax planning strategies and related to a previously-disposed business. Further information concerning income tax matters is contained in Note 4 of the consolidated financial statements.\nNet income\nNet income and related per share amounts are presented in the table below (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>478,197 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1%) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>482,763 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Per basic share </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.15 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2%) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.20 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Per diluted share </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.14 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2%) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.19 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur 2021 earnings per share were lower than 2020 due to the factors discussed above including, most notably, the decrease in political revenue following the 2020 presidential election year, partially offset by increases in AMS revenue reflecting higher demand for television and digital advertising (as fiscal year 2020 was adversely impacted by reduced demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic) and increase in subscription revenue from annual rate increases under existing and newly renegotiated retransmission agreements.\nOperating results non-GAAP information\nPresentation of non-GAAP information: We use non-GAAP financial performance measures to supplement the financial information presented on a GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the related GAAP measures, nor should they be considered superior to the related GAAP measures, and should be read together with financial information presented on a GAAP basis. Also, our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nManagement and our Board of Directors use the non-GAAP financial measures for purposes of evaluating company performance. Furthermore, the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors uses non-GAAP measures such as Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP EPS, and free cash flow to evaluate management's performance. Therefore, we believe that each of the non-GAAP measures presented provides useful information to investors and other stakeholders by allowing them to view our business through the eyes of management and our Board of Directors, facilitating comparisons of results across historical periods and focus on the underlying ongoing operating performance of our business. We also believe these non-GAAP measures are frequently used by investors, securities analysts and other interested parties in their evaluation of our business and other companies in the broadcast industry.\nWe discuss in this Form 10-K non-GAAP financial performance measures that exclude from our reported GAAP results the impact of special items\u201d which are described in detail below in the section titled Discussion of special charges and credits affecting reporting results\u201d. We believe that such expenses and gains are not indicative of normal, ongoing operations. While these items may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in evaluation of our earnings performance, it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results and trends compared to other periods as these items can vary significantly from period to period depending on specific underlying transactions or events that may occur. Therefore, while we may incur or recognize these types of expenses, charges and gains in the future, we believe that removing these items for purposes of calculating the non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with a more focused presentation of our ongoing operating performance.\nWe discuss Adjusted EBITDA (with and without corporate expenses), a non-GAAP financial performance measure that we believe offers a useful view of the overall operation of our businesses. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to TEGNA before (1) net (income) loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest, (2) income taxes, (3) interest expense, (4) equity (loss) income in unconsolidated investments, net, (5) other non-operating items, net, (6) workforce restructuring expense, (7) M&A-related costs, (8) advisory fees related to activism defense, (9) spectrum repacking reimbursements and other, net, (10) depreciation and (11) amortization. We believe these adjustments facilitate company-to-company operating performance comparisons by removing potential differences caused by variations unrelated to operating performance, such as capital structures (interest expense), income taxes, and the age and book appreciation of property and equipment (and related depreciation expense). The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to Adjusted EBITDA is Net income attributable to TEGNA. Users should consider the limitations of using Adjusted EBITDA, including the fact that this measure does not provide a complete measure of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to purport to be an alternate to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. In particular, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of cash flow available for management's discretionary expenditures, as this measure does not consider certain cash requirements, such as working capital needs, capital expenditures, contractual commitments, interest payments, tax payments and other debt service requirements.\nWe also discuss free cash flow, a non-GAAP performance measure that the Board of Directors uses to review the performance of the business. Free cash flow is reviewed by the Board of Directors as a percentage of revenue over a trailing two-year period (reflecting both an even and odd year reporting period given the political cyclicality of our business). The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to free cash flow is Net income attributable to TEGNA. Free cash flow is calculated as non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA (as defined above), further adjusted by adding back (1) stock-based compensation, (2) non-cash 401(k) company match, (3) syndicated programming amortization, (4) pension reimbursements, (5) dividends received from equity method investments and (6) reimbursements from spectrum repacking. This is further adjusted by deducting payments made for (1) syndicated programming, (2) pension, (3) interest, (4) taxes (net of refunds) and (5) purchases of property and equipment. Like Adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow is not intended to be a measure of cash flow available for management's discretionary use.\nDiscussion of special charges and credits affecting reported results: Our results during 2021 and 2020 included the following items we consider special items\u201d that while at times recurring, can vary significantly from period to period:\nResults for the year ended December 31, 2021:\n\u2022Spectrum repacking reimbursements and other, net consisting of gains due to reimbursements from the FCC for required spectrum repacking, a contract termination fee and the write off of certain fixed assets;\n\u2022Advisory fees related to activism defense;\n\u2022M&A-related costs we incurred to assist prospective buyers of our company with their due diligence;\n\u2022Other non-operating items consisting of a gain due to an observable price increase in an equity investment and costs incurred in connection with the early extinguishment of debt; and\n\u2022Net deferred tax benefits as a result of state tax planning strategies implemented during 2021, deferred tax benefits related to partial capital loss valuation allowance release, and return to provision and deferred adjustments related to the completion of our 2020 state tax returns.\nResults for the year ended December 31, 2020:\n\u2022Workforce restructuring expense which included payroll and related benefit costs at our stations (including the shutdown of our TMS Phoenix operations) and corporate headquarters;\n\u2022M&A-related costs we incurred to assist prospective buyers of our company with their due diligence;\n\u2022Advisory fees related to activism defense;\n\u2022Spectrum repacking reimbursements and other, net consists of gains due to reimbursements from the FCC for required spectrum repacking, partially offset by an intangible asset impairment charge due to the retirement of a brand name and an FCC license impairment charge related to a radio station;\n\u2022Gains recognized in our equity income in unconsolidated investments, primarily related to our share of CareerBuilder's gain on the sale of certain subsidiary businesses;\n\u2022Other non-operating items primarily related to costs incurred in connection with the early extinguishment of debt, and an impairment charge related to one of our investments; and\n\u2022Deferred tax benefits related to partial capital loss valuation allowance release.\nBelow are reconciliations of certain line items impacted by special items to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP on our Consolidated Statements of Income (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Special Items </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended Dec. 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>GAAP\nmeasure </td> <td> </td> <td>Advisory fees related to activism defense </td> <td> </td> <td>M&A-related costs </td> <td> </td> <td>Other non-operating items </td> <td> </td> <td>Spectrum repacking reimbursements and other </td> <td> </td> <td>Special tax items </td> <td> </td> <td>Non-GAAP measure </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate -

The increase in free cash flow is primarily due to increases in retransmission and political revenue.\nFINANCIAL POSITION\nLiquidity and capital resources\nOur operations have historically generated strong positive cash flow which, along with availability under our existing revolving credit facility and cash and cash equivalents on hand, have been sufficient to fund our capital expenditures, interest expense, dividends, investments in strategic initiatives (including acquisitions) and other operating requirements.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had far-reaching impacts on many aspects of our operations, directly and indirectly, including our employees, consumer behavior, distribution of our content, our vendors, and the overall market. The full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly with regard to the broader advertising industry, remains uncertain and continues to evolve. However, during 2021, the U.S. economy continued on a path towards recovery with millions of Americans receiving COVID-19 vaccines, states and municipalities increasingly reopening and continued growth in employment, although the development of new variants of the virus continues to cause concern. In addition, the U.S. federal government continued to enact policies to provide fiscal stimulus to the economy and relief to those affected by the pandemic, with stimulus bolstering household finances as well as those of small businesses, states and municipalities.\nThe improving conditions around the pandemic, coupled with strategic actions we've taken with our 2020 and 2019 debt refinancings and reduction of discretionary spending, have helped strengthen our financial position. On March 29, 2021, we\nannounced that our Board of Directors approved a dividend increase of ten cents per share on an annual basis, to $0.38 per common share, which represents an approximately 36% increase above the prior dividend. We paid dividends totaling $78.5 million in 2021 and $76.5 million in 2020. We expect to continue to pay our regular quarterly dividend of $0.095 per share through the closing of the Merger, which is the maximum rate and frequency permitted by the Merger Agreement.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all covenants contained in our debt agreements and credit facility and our leverage ratio, calculated in accordance with our revolving credit agreement, was 3.19x, well below the permitted leverage ratio of less than 5.50x. The leverage ratio is calculated using annualized adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the agreement) for the trailing eight quarters. We believe that we will remain compliant with all covenants for the foreseeable future. Our financial and operating performance, as well as our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to maintain compliance with credit facility covenants, are subject to certain risk factors; see Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d for further discussion.\nContractual obligations\nAn important use of our liquidity pertains to purchasing programming rights. Most of our stations have network affiliations agreements with major broadcast networks (ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox). Under these agreements, the television networks produce and distribute programming to us in exchange for our stations commitments to air the programming at specified times and to pay the networks compensation at fixed or variable rates (such as a rate per number of MVPD subscribers accessing the programming). The network affiliation agreements generally have a three-year term. In addition, programming rights include acquired syndicated programming (television series and movies that are purchased on a group basis for use by our owned stations). These contracts typically cover a period of up to five years, with payments typically made over several years. As of December 31,2021, we had total programming commitments of $1.35 billion, of which $808.4 million will be settled within the next twelve months. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding programming commitments.\nWe also secure our on-air talent and other key personnel at our television stations through multi-year talent and employment agreements. We expect our contracts for talent and other key personnel will be renewed or replaced with similar agreements upon their expiration. As of December 31, 2021, amounts due under these contracts were approximately $236.8 million, of which approximately $133.6 million will be paid within the next twelve months.\nOther material contractual obligations include our operating leases (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further details) as well as our long-term debt and interest payments (see \u2018Long-term debt' section below, as well as Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further details).\nCash Flows\nThe following table provides a summary of our cash flow information for the three years ended December 31, 2021 followed by a discussion of the key elements of our cash flows (in thousands):\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash at beginning of year </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,968 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,404 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>135,862 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Net income </td> <td>478,197 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>482,763 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>286,235 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Depreciation, amortization and other non-cash adjustments </td> <td>204,461 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>202,189 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>156,858 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Pension expense, net of pension contribution </td> <td>(19,139) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10,400) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(19,447) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> (Increase) decrease in accounts receivable </td> <td>(88,687) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,474 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(86,245) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> (Decrease) increase in interest and taxes payable </td> <td>(53,303) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66,466 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,284) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Other, net </td> <td>(19,917) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,644 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31,644) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash flows from operating activities </td> <td>501,612 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>805,136 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>297,473 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payments for acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired </td> <td>(13,335) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(34,841) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,514,183) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All other investing activities </td> <td>(55,921) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(24,680) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(49,287) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used for investing activities </td> <td>(69,256) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(59,521) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,563,470) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used for) provided by financing activities </td> <td>(416,335) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(734,051) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,159,539 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash </td> <td>16,021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,564 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(106,458) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash at end of year </td> <td>$ </td> <td>56,989 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,968 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,404 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nCash flow from operating activities was $501.6 million in 2021, compared to $805.1 million in 2020. This $303.5 million decrease was primarily driven by a $385.0 million decrease in political revenue. As political advertisements are typically paid upfront, they provide an immediate benefit to operating cash flow as compared to non-political advertising which is billed and collected in arrears after the advertisement has been delivered. Also contributing to the decrease was an increase in tax payments of $94.3 million in 2021 as compared to 2020. This increase was driven by the adverse impact of COVID-19 on our 2020 financial results, particularly during the first six months of 2020. The subsequent recovery in demand for advertising thereafter resulted in an increase in our taxable income and led to the increase in tax payments in 2021. Partially offsetting the decline in operating cash flow was a $21.0 million decline in interest payments due to a lower average debt balance in 2021, mainly driven by a lower average balance on our revolving credit facility.\nInvesting Activities\nCash flow used for investing activities was $69.3 million in 2021, compared to $59.5 million in 2020. The increase of $9.8 million was primary due to a $17.6 million increase in the purchase of property and equipment, a decrease in spectrum reimbursement of $8.2 million and $21.5 million less being spent on acquisitions in 2021 as compared to 2020.\nFinancing Activities\nCash flow used for financing activities was $416.3 million in 2021, compared to $734.1 million in 2020. The change was primarily due to debt activity in 2020. Specifically, in January 2020 we issued $1.0 billion of unsecured notes, the proceeds of which were used to redeem $650.0 million of unsecured notes due in October 2023 and $310.0 million due in July 2020. Additionally, in September 2020 we issued $550 million of senior unsecured notes. In October 2020, we repaid the entire $350 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.875% senior unsecured notes due in 2021 and $188 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.500% senior unsecured notes due in 2024. We incurred fees of $41.4 million related to this debt activity and an amendment of the revolving credit facility.\nWe also had net repayments of $189.0 million on our revolving credit facility in 2021 as compared to net repayments of $548.0 million in 2020. In addition, in 2021 we repaid the remaining $137 million of our 5.500% unsecured senior notes, which were due in September 2024.\nFor a comparative discussion of changes in our cash flow comparing the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, see Part II, Item 7. Financial Position\u201d of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on March 1, 2021.\nLong-term debt\nAs of December 31, 2021, our total principal debt outstanding was $3.26 billion, cash and cash equivalents totaled $57.0 million, and we had unused borrowing capacity of $1.33 billion under our revolving credit facility, which is our primary source for funding short-term cash requirements. As of December 31, 2021, approximately $3.09 billion, or 95%, of our debt had a fixed interest rate. See Note 5 Long-term debt\u201d to our consolidated financial statements for a table summarizing the components of our long-term debt.\nOn December 3, 2021 we utilized available cash and our revolving credit facility to repay the remaining $137 million of our 5.500% unsecured senior notes, which were due in September 2024. We incurred $1.3 million of early redemption fees and wrote off $1.2 million of unamortized financing fees and discounts related to this early payoff of the 2024 notes.\nWe expect our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from our operations and borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our debt service obligations, capital expenditure requirements, and working capital needs for the next twelve months and beyond. Our interest payments may be repaid with cash flow from operating activities, accessing capital markets or a combination of both. Interest payments on the senior notes are based on the stated cash coupon rate. As of December 31, 2021, we had future interest payments on our senior notes of $1.00 billion, of which $160.3 million will be paid within the next twelve months. We also had $166.0 million of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2021. Future interest payments on the revolving credit facility are not known with certainty as payments into and out of the credit facility can change daily and interest payments are based on variable interest rates. For illustrative purposes, assuming the December 31, 2021 revolving credit facility balance does not change during 2022 and rates remain at the same level as those existing as of December 31, 2021, we estimate interest payments in 2022 will be approximately $5.3 million.\nThe following schedule discloses future annual maturities of the principal amount of total debt due (in thousands):\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Repayment schedule of principal long-term debt as of Dec. 31, 2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2022 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2023 </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2024 (1)\n</td> <td>166,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2025 </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2026 </td> <td>550,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Thereafter </td> <td>2,540,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,256,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Assumes the current revolving credit facility borrowings come due in 2024 and the revolving credit facility is not extended.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOff-balance sheet arrangements as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission include the following four categories: obligations under certain guarantee contracts; retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangements that serve as credit, liquidity or market risk support; obligations under certain derivative arrangements classified as equity; and obligations under material variable interests. As of December 31, 2021, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nCapital stock\nIn December 2020, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program for up to $300.0 million of our common stock over the next three years. From 2019 through 2021, no shares were repurchased. Certain of the shares we previously acquired have been reissued in settlement of employee stock awards. As a result of the announcement of the Merger Agreement on February 22, 2022, we have suspended share repurchases under this program.\nOur common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2021, totaled 221,406,177 shares, compared with 219,500,272 shares as of December 31, 2020.\nCritical accounting policies and estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. We believe the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are material to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's most subjective and complex judgments. This commentary should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the remainder of this Form 10-K.\nGoodwill: As of December 31, 2021, our goodwill balance was $2.98 billion and represented approximately 43% of our total assets. Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, net of liabilities assumed.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at a level referred to as the reporting unit. A reporting unit is a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results. The level at which we test goodwill for impairment requires us to determine whether the operations below the operating segment level constitute a reporting unit. We have determined that our one segment, Media, consists of a single reporting unit.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis (first day of our fourth quarter) or between annual tests if events or changes in circumstances occurred that indicate the fair value of a reporting unit may be below its carrying amount.\nBefore performing the annual goodwill impairment test quantitatively, we first have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if the quantitative test must be completed. The qualitative assessment considers events and circumstances such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors and overall financial performance, as well as company and specific reporting unit specifications. If after performing this assessment, we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we are required to perform the quantitative test. Otherwise, the quantitative test is not required. In 2021, we elected not to perform the optional qualitative assessment of goodwill and instead performed the quantitative impairment test.\nWhen performing the quantitative test, we determine the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, the reporting unit's goodwill is impaired and we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between the reporting unit's carrying amount and fair value.\nWe estimate the fair value of our one reporting unit based on a market-based valuation methodology, which is primarily based on our consolidated market capitalization plus a control premium. In the fourth quarter of 2021 we completed our annual goodwill impairment test for our reporting unit. The results of the test indicated that the estimated fair value of our reporting unit significantly exceeded the carrying value. We do not believe that the reporting unit is currently at risk of incurring a goodwill impairment in the foreseeable future.\nImpairment assessment inherently involves management judgments regarding the assumptions described above. Fair value of the reporting unit also depends on the future strength of the economy in our principal media markets. New and developing competition as well as technological change could also adversely affect our stock price and future fair value estimates.\nIndefinite Lived Intangibles: This category consists entirely of FCC broadcast licenses related to our acquisitions of television stations. As of December 31, 2021, indefinite lived intangible assets were $2.12 billion and represented approximately 31% of our total assets.\nThe FCC broadcast licenses are recorded at their estimated fair value as of the date of the business acquisition. We determine the fair value of each FCC broadcast license using an income approach referred to as the Greenfield method. The Greenfield method utilizes a discounted cash flow model that incorporates several key assumptions, including market revenues, long-term growth projections, estimated market share for a typical market participant, estimated profit margins based on market size and station type, and a discount rate (determined using a weighted average cost of capital). Because these licenses are considered indefinite lived intangible assets we do not amortize them. Instead, they are tested for impairment annually (on the first day of our fourth quarter), or more often if circumstances dictate, for impairment and written down to fair value as required.\nWe have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite lived asset is more than its carrying amount. If that is the case, then we do not need to perform the quantitative analysis. The qualitative assessment considers trends in macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors and overall financial performance of the indefinite lived asset. In 2021, we elected not to perform the optional qualitative assessment, and instead performed the quantitative impairment assessment for all of our FCC broadcast licenses. We have FCC licenses acquired in the KFMB-San Diego station acquisition in 2018 as well as those acquired in our 2019 acquisitions (Gray stations, Dispatch stations, and Nexstar stations), which represented an aggregate carrying value of $897.7 million. These licenses have more limited headroom due to the fact that we recently recorded them at fair value upon their respective acquisition, and as a result are more susceptible to the risk of impairment due to changes in underlying market factors.\nThe quantitative analysis performed included projected estimated economic impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. Changes in key fair value assumptions used in our analysis could result in future non-cash impairment charges, and any related impairment could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Changes in key fair value assumptions that could result in a future impairment charge include increases in discount rates and declines in market revenues. A 100 basis point increase in our discount rate or a 10% decline in market revenues (holding all other assumptions in the fair value model constant) would result in an aggregate impairment charge of approximately $17.0 million or less.\nPension Liabilities: Certain employees participate in qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans (see Note 6 to consolidated financial statements). Our principal defined benefit pension plan is the TEGNA Retirement Plan (TRP). We also sponsor the TEGNA Supplemental Retirement Plan (SERP) for certain employees. Substantially all participants in the TRP and SERP had their benefits frozen before 2009, and in December 2017, we froze all remaining accruing benefits for certain grandfathered SERP participants.\nWe recognize the net funded status of these postretirement benefit plans as a liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. There is a corresponding non-cash adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax benefits recorded as deferred tax assets, in stockholders' equity. The funded status represents the difference between the fair value of each plan's assets and the benefit obligation of the plan. The benefit obligation represents the present value of the estimated future benefits we currently expect to pay to plan participants based on past service.\nThe plan assets and benefit obligations are measured as of December 31 of each year, or more frequently, upon the occurrence of certain events such as a plan amendment, settlement, or curtailment. The amounts we record are measured using actuarial valuations, which are dependent upon key assumptions such as discount rates, participant mortality rates and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The assumptions we make affect both the calculation of the benefit obligations as of the measurement date and the calculation of net periodic pension expense in subsequent periods. When reassessing these assumptions we consider past and current market conditions and make judgments about future market trends. We also consider factors such as the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants.\nThe most important assumptions include the discount rate applied to pension plan obligations and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets related for the TRP (the SERP is an unfunded plan). The discount rate assumption is based on investment yields available at year-end on corporate bonds rated AA and above with a maturity to match the expected benefit payment stream. A decrease in discount rates would increase pension obligations.\nWe establish the expected long-term rate of return by developing a forward-looking, long-term return assumption for each pension fund asset class, taking into account factors such as the expected real return for the specific asset class and inflation. A single, long-term rate of return is then calculated as the weighted average of the target asset allocation percentages and the long-term return assumption for each asset class. We apply the expected long-term rate of return to the fair value of its pension assets in determining the dollar amount of its expected return. Changes in the expected long-term return on plan assets would increase or decrease pension plan expense. For 2021, we assumed a rate of 6.50% for our long-term expected return on pension assets used for our TRP plan. As an indication of the sensitivity of pension expense to the long-term rate of return assumption, a plus or minus 50 basis points change in the expected rate of return on pension assets (with all other assumptions held constant) would have decreased or increased estimated pension plan expense for 2021 by approximately $2.7 million. The effects of actual results differing from this assumption is accumulated as unamortized gains and losses.\nFor the December 31, 2021 measurement, the assumption used for the discount rate was 2.89% for our TRP and SERP plans. As an indication of the sensitivity of pension liabilities to the discount rate assumption, a plus or minus 50 basis points change in the discount rate as of the end of 2021 (with all other assumptions held constant) would have decreased or increased plan obligations by approximately $30.9 million. For 2021, the discount rate used to determine the pension expense was 2.54%. A 50 basis points increase or decrease in this discount rate would have decreased or increased total pension plan expense for 2021 by approximately $0.6 million.\nIncome Taxes: Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates, and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions.\nTax law requires certain items to be included in our tax returns at different times than when the items are reflected in the financial statements. The annual tax expense reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income is different than that reported in our tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent (for example, expenses recorded for accounting purposes that are not deductible in the returns such as certain entertainment expenses) and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements, as well as tax losses that can be carried over and used in future years. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amounts we believe are more likely than not to be recovered. In evaluating the amount of any such valuation allowance, we consider the existence of cumulative income or losses in recent years, the reversal of existing temporary differences, the existence of taxable income in prior carry back years, available tax planning strategies and estimates of future taxable income for each of our taxable jurisdictions. The latter two factors involve the exercise of significant judgment. As of December 31, 2021, deferred tax asset valuation allowances totaled $41.9 million, primarily related to federal and state capital losses, accrued compensation costs, minority investments, state interest disallowance carryovers, and state net operating losses available for carry forward to future years. Although realization is not assured, we believe it is more likely than not that all other deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowances have been established will be realized. This conclusion is based on our history of cumulative income in recent years and review of historical and projected future taxable income.\nWe determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities before any part of the benefit is recorded in our financial statements. A tax position is measured as the portion of the tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement with a taxing authority (that has full knowledge of all relevant information). We may be required to change our provision for income taxes when the ultimate treatment of certain items is challenged or agreed to by taxing authorities, when estimates used in determining valuation allowances on deferred tax assets significantly change, or when receipt of new information indicates the need for adjustment in valuation allowances. Future events, such as changes in tax laws, tax regulations, or interpretations of such laws or regulations, could have an impact on the provision for income tax and the effective tax rate. Any such changes could significantly affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements in the year these changes occur.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIntroduction\nWe are an innovative media company serving the greater good of our communities. Across platforms, we tell empowering stories, conduct impactful investigations and deliver innovative marketing services. With 64 television stations and two radio stations in 51 U.S. markets, we are the largest owner of top four network affiliates in the top 25 markets among independent station groups, reaching approximately 39% of U.S. television households. We also own leading multicast networks True Crime Network, Twist and Quest. Each television station also has a robust digital presence across online, mobile and social platforms, reaching consumers on all devices and platforms they use to consume news content. We have been consistently honored with the industry's top awards, including Edward R. Murrow, George Polk, Alfred I. DuPont and Emmy Awards. Through TEGNA Marketing Solutions (TMS), our integrated sales and back-end fulfillment operations, we deliver results for advertisers across television, digital and over-the-top (OTT) platforms, including Premion, our OTT advertising network.\nWe have one operating and reportable segment. The primary sources of our revenues are: 1) subscription revenues, reflecting fees paid by satellite, cable, OTT (companies that deliver video content to consumers over the Internet) and telecommunications providers to carry our television signals on their systems; 2) advertising & marketing services (AMS) revenues, which include local and national non-political television advertising, digital marketing services (including Premion), and advertising on stations' websites, tablet and mobile products and OTT apps; 3) political advertising revenues, which are driven by even-year election cycles at the local and national level (e.g., 2022, 2020. etc.) and particularly in the second half of those years; and 4) other services, such as production of programming, tower rentals and distribution of our local news content.\nOn February 22, 2022, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Parent, Merger Sub, and solely for purposes of certain provisions specified therein, other subsidiaries of Parent, certain affiliates Standard General and CMG and certain of its subsidiaries. We currently expect the transaction, which is subject to stockholder and regulatory approvals, and other customary closing conditions, to close in the second half of 2022. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d and Note 12 - Subsequent Event of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this report.\nCOVID-19 pandemic\nSince early 2020, the world has been, and continues to be, impacted by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and its variants. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges including widespread economic and social change throughout the United States. The U.S. economy continued on a path to recovery during 2021 with millions of Americans receiving COVID-19 vaccines, states/municipalities increasingly reopening and continued growth in employment. In addition, the U.S. federal government continued to enact policies to provide fiscal stimulus to the economy and relief to those affected by the pandemic, with the stimulus bolstering household finances as well as those of small businesses, states and municipalities. Our AMS revenues were most negatively impacted by the pandemic early in the second quarter of 2020 but since then AMS revenues have improved significantly as economic re-opening accelerated.\nThe impact of COVID-19 and the extent of its adverse impact on our financial and operating results will be dictated by the degree to which the pandemic continues to affect our advertising customers. This will depend on future pandemic-related developments including the severity of COVID-19 variants, disruptions to our customers' supply chains and impacts to their advertising and marketing purchasing patterns, the effectiveness, distribution and acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines and booster shots, consumer confidence, and U.S. government actions to prevent and manage the virus spread, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. While we use the best information available in developing significant estimates included in our financial statements, the effects of the pandemic on our operations may not be fully realized, or reflected in our financial results, until future periods. As such, actual results could differ from our estimates and these differences resulting from changes in facts and circumstances could be material.\nSeasonality: Our revenues and operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations. Generally, our second and fourth quarter operating results are stronger than those of the first and third quarter. This is driven by the second quarter reflecting increased spring seasonal advertising, while the fourth quarter typically includes increased advertising related to the holiday season. In addition, our revenue and operating results are subject to significant fluctuations across yearly periods resulting from political advertising. In even numbered years, political spending is usually significantly higher than in odd numbered years due to advertising for the local and national elections. Additionally, every four years, we typically experience even greater increases in political advertising in connection with the presidential election. The strong demand for advertising from political advertisers in these even years can result in the significant use of our available inventory (leading to a crowd out\u201d effect), which can diminish our AMS revenue in the even year of a two year election cycle, particularly in the fourth quarter of those years.\nConsolidated Results from Operations\nThe following discussion is a comparison of our consolidated results on a GAAP basis. The year-to-year comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of future results. In addition, see the section on page 32 titled \u2018Operating results non-GAAP information' for additional tables presenting information which supplements our financial information provided on a GAAP basis.\nAs discussed above, our operating results are subject to significant fluctuations across yearly periods (driven by even-year election cycles). As such, in addition to one year ago comparisons, our management team and Board of Directors also review current period operating results compared to the same period two years ago (e.g., 2021 vs. 2019). We believe this comparison will also provide useful information to investors, and therefore, we have supplemented our prior year comparison of consolidated results to also include a comparison against 2019 results (through operating income).\nDuring 2019, we acquired multiple local television stations and multicast networks. Specifically, we acquired certain stations divested by Gray (January 2, 2019), the Justice Network (rebranded as True Crime Network) and Quest multicast networks (June 18, 2019), the Dispatch stations (August 8, 2019) and certain stations divested by Nexstar (September 19, 2019). The multicast networks, Dispatch stations, and Nexstar stations are collectively referred to as the 2019 Acquisitions\u201d in the discussion that follows. These 2019 Acquisitions did not contribute to the periods prior to their acquisition in our financial statements which impacts 2021 to 2019 comparability of our consolidated operating results. The Gray stations do not impact the 2021 to 2019 comparability.\nFor a comparative discussion of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, see Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on March 1, 2021.\nA consolidated summary of our results is presented below (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change from 2020\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change from 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues: </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,991,093 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,937,780 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,299,497 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenues </td> <td>1,598,759 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,503,287 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6% </td> <td> </td> <td>1,228,237 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Business units -

The net increase was primarily due to $253.3 million growth in AMS reflecting higher demand for television and digital advertising, year over year. Growth in subscription revenue of $179.8 million was primarily due to annual rate increases under existing and newly renegotiated retransmission agreements, partially offset by declines in subscribers including the impact of an outage with a broadcast satellite provider that began on October 6, 2021 and ended in early 2022. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in political revenue of $385.0 million, following the 2020 presidential election year.\n2021 vs. 2019\nTotal revenues increased $691.6 million in 2021. Our 2019 Acquisitions contributed $306.2 million to this increase. Excluding the 2019 Acquisitions, total revenues increased $385.4 million. This increase was primarily due to a $303.5 million increase in legacy subscription revenue from annual rate increases under existing and newly renegotiated retransmission agreements, partially offset by declines in subscribers including the impact of an outage with a broadcast satellite provider that began on October 6, 2021 and ended in early 2022. Also contributing to the increase was a $51.5 million increase in AMS revenue, driven in part by Premion, and a $21.9 million increase in political advertising revenue.\nCost of revenues\n2021 vs. 2020\nCost of revenues increased $95.5 million in 2021. This increase was primarily due to a $72.8 million growth in programming costs driven by a contractual increase in rates under existing and newly renegotiated affiliation agreements and growth in subscription revenues (certain programming costs are linked to such revenues). Higher digital expenses of $7.6 million driven by growth in Premion also contributed to the increase.\n2021 vs. 2019\nCost of revenues increased $370.5 million in 2021. Our 2019 Acquisitions contributed $164.5 million to this increase. Excluding the 2019 Acquisitions, cost of revenues increased $206.0 million. This increase was primarily due to a $179.2 million increase in programming costs driven by a contractual increase in rates under existing and newly renegotiated affiliation agreements and growth in subscription revenues (certain programming costs are linked to such revenues). Higher digital expenses of $12.6 million driven by growth in Premion also contributed to the increase.\nBusiness units - Selling, general and administrative expenses\n2021 vs. 2020\nBusiness unit selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased $30.8 million in 2021. The increase was primarily due to a $13.9 million increase in legal and professional fees. Marketing costs also rose $8.0 million. Sales commissions and other selling costs also increased by $23.1 million driven by growth in AMS revenues. These increases were partially offset by a $8.7 million reduction in bad debt expense attributed to improved collections.\n2021 vs. 2019\nBusiness unit SG&A expenses increased $69.6 million in 2021. Our 2019 Acquisitions added business unit SG&A expenses of $32.9 million. Excluding the 2019 Acquisitions, SG&A expenses increased $36.7 million. The increase was primarily the result of a $20.6 million increase in legal and professional fees. Sales commissions and other selling costs increased by $18.0 million driven by growth in AMS revenues. Stock based compensation expense was also higher by $3.9 million, driven by our higher stock price.\nCorporate - General and administrative expenses\nOur corporate costs are separated from our direct business expenses and are recorded as general and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Income. This category primarily consists of corporate management and support functions including Legal, Human Resources, and Finance, as well as activities and costs not directly attributable to the operations of our media business.\n2021 vs. 2020\nCorporate general and administrative expenses decreased $5.2 million in 2021. The decrease was primarily driven by a $6.5 million reduction in advisory fees related to activism defense, and reduction of $0.9 million of M&A-related costs. Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in stock based compensation expense of $2.2 million driven by our higher stock price.\n2021 vs. 2019\nCorporate general and administrative expenses decreased $12.0 million in 2021. The decrease was primarily due to the absence of acquisition-related costs of $30.8 million due to the reduction in acquisition activity in 2021. Partially offsetting this decrease were increases of $10.5 million in advisory fees related to activism defense, $3.7 million in M&A-related costs and $1.8 million in stock based compensation expense due to our higher stock price.\nDepreciation expense\n2021 vs. 2020\nDepreciation expense decreased $2.0 million in 2021 due to a decline in capital expenditures resulting in less depreciation in 2021 as fewer new assets were placed in service.\n2021 vs. 2019\nDepreciation expense increased $4.3 million in 2021 driven by our 2019 Acquisitions which contributed $8.0 million to the increase. Excluding the impact of 2019 Acquisitions, depreciation expense decreased $3.7 million due to a decline in capital expenditures following the onset of COVID-19, resulting in less depreciation in 2021 as fewer new assets were placed in service.\nAmortization of intangible assets\n2021 vs. 2020\nIntangible asset amortization expense decreased $4.7 million in 2021. The decrease is due to certain assets reaching the end of their assumed useful lives and therefore becoming fully amortized.\n2021 vs. 2019\nIntangible asset amortization expense increased $12.9 million in 2021. Our 2019 Acquisitions contributed $23.1 million to this increase. Excluding the impact of the 2019 Acquisitions, amortization expense decreased $10.2 million due to certain assets reaching the end of their assumed useful lives.\nSpectrum repacking reimbursements and other, net\n2021 vs. 2020\nWe had other net gains of $2.3 million in 2021 compared to net gains of $10.0 million in 2020. The 2021 activity is related to $4.9 million of reimbursements received from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for required spectrum repacking, partially offset by a $1.5 million contract termination fee and a $1.1 million write off of certain assets. The 2020 net gains primarily consisted of $13.2 million of reimbursements received from the FCC for required spectrum repacking, partially offset by a $2.1 million impairment charge due to the retirement of a brand name and a $1.1 million FCC license impairment charge.\n2021 vs. 2019\nWe had other net gains of $2.3 million in 2021 compared to net gains of $5.3 million in 2019. The 2021 activity consists of the items discussed above. The 2019 net gains consisted of gains of $17.0 million of reimbursements received from the FCC for required spectrum repacking and a gain of $2.9 million as a result of the sale of certain real estate. These gains were partially offset by a $5.5 million in contract termination charge and transition costs related to bringing our national sales organization in-house and $9.1 million of non-cash charges to reduce the value of certain assets classified as held-for-sale.\nOperating income\n2021 vs. 2020\nOur operating income decreased $68.8 million in 2021. This decrease was driven by the changes in revenue and expenses discussed above, but primarily due to a decline in high-margin political revenue.\n2021 vs. 2019\nOperating income increased $243.2 million in 2021. Results from our 2019 Acquisitions added operating income of $77.8 million. Excluding the 2019 Acquisitions, operating income increased $165.4 million, driven by the changes in revenue and expenses discussed above, most notably the increases in subscription revenue.\nProgramming and payroll expense trends\nProgramming and payroll expenses are the two largest elements of our operating expenses, and are summarized below, expressed as a percentage of total operating expenses. Programming expenses as a percentage of total operating expenses have increased due to an increase in reverse compensation payments to our network affiliation partners. Payroll expenses have increased during 2021, but as a percentage of total operating expenses have decreased in 2021 primarily due to increases in programming expenses, which make up a larger percentage of operating costs.\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Percentage of total operating expenses </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expense Category </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Programming expenses </td> <td>41.2% </td> <td> </td> <td>40.1% </td> <td> </td> <td>35.5% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payroll expenses </td> <td>25.8% </td> <td> </td> <td>26.7% </td> <td> </td> <td>28.6% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-operating income and expense\nEquity income: This income statement category reflects earnings or losses from our equity method investments. Equity income decreased from $10.4 million in 2020 to a loss of $9.7 million in 2021. The 2021 loss was primarily due to equity loss from our CareerBuilder investment. The 2020 income was primarily due to equity income from our CareerBuilder investment (recognizing gains driven by the sale of several subsidiary businesses).\nInterest expense: Interest expense decreased $24.6 million in 2021 as compared to 2020, primarily due to a lower average outstanding total debt balance, partially offset by higher interest rates. The total average outstanding debt was $3.41 billion in 2021 compared to $4.02 billion in 2020. The impact of the decrease in outstanding debt was partially offset by an increase in the weighted average interest rate on total outstanding debt, which was 5.15% in 2021 compared to 5.03% in 2020.\nA further discussion of our borrowing and related interest cost is presented in the Liquidity and capital resources\u201d section of this report beginning on page 36 and in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.\nOther non-operating items, net: Other non-operating items increased $40.9 million from a net loss of $34.0 million in 2020 to a net income of $6.8 million in 2021. This change was comprised of 2020 charges absent in 2021 including a $17.3 million call premium related to the repayment of our 2023 and 2024 unsecured senior notes; and acceleration of $11.8 million of previously deferred financing fees associated with early repayment of unsecured senior notes. In addition, the increase was driven by the absence of a $9.2 million impairment of an equity investment in 2020.\nProvision for income taxes\nWe reported pre-tax income of $613.7 million for 2021. The effective tax rate on pre-tax income was 22.1%. The 2021 effective tax rate decreased compared to 24.2% in 2020 primarily due to tax benefits realized as a result of state tax planning strategies and related to a previously-disposed business. Further information concerning income tax matters is contained in Note 4 of the consolidated financial statements.\nNet income\nNet income and related per share amounts are presented in the table below (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>478,197 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1%) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>482,763 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Per basic share </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.15 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2%) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.20 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Per diluted share </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.14 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2%) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.19 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur 2021 earnings per share were lower than 2020 due to the factors discussed above including, most notably, the decrease in political revenue following the 2020 presidential election year, partially offset by increases in AMS revenue reflecting higher demand for television and digital advertising (as fiscal year 2020 was adversely impacted by reduced demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic) and increase in subscription revenue from annual rate increases under existing and newly renegotiated retransmission agreements.\nOperating results non-GAAP information\nPresentation of non-GAAP information: We use non-GAAP financial performance measures to supplement the financial information presented on a GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the related GAAP measures, nor should they be considered superior to the related GAAP measures, and should be read together with financial information presented on a GAAP basis. Also, our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nManagement and our Board of Directors use the non-GAAP financial measures for purposes of evaluating company performance. Furthermore, the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors uses non-GAAP measures such as Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP EPS, and free cash flow to evaluate management's performance. Therefore, we believe that each of the non-GAAP measures presented provides useful information to investors and other stakeholders by allowing them to view our business through the eyes of management and our Board of Directors, facilitating comparisons of results across historical periods and focus on the underlying ongoing operating performance of our business. We also believe these non-GAAP measures are frequently used by investors, securities analysts and other interested parties in their evaluation of our business and other companies in the broadcast industry.\nWe discuss in this Form 10-K non-GAAP financial performance measures that exclude from our reported GAAP results the impact of special items\u201d which are described in detail below in the section titled Discussion of special charges and credits affecting reporting results\u201d. We believe that such expenses and gains are not indicative of normal, ongoing operations. While these items may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in evaluation of our earnings performance, it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results and trends compared to other periods as these items can vary significantly from period to period depending on specific underlying transactions or events that may occur. Therefore, while we may incur or recognize these types of expenses, charges and gains in the future, we believe that removing these items for purposes of calculating the non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with a more focused presentation of our ongoing operating performance.\nWe discuss Adjusted EBITDA (with and without corporate expenses), a non-GAAP financial performance measure that we believe offers a useful view of the overall operation of our businesses. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to TEGNA before (1) net (income) loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest, (2) income taxes, (3) interest expense, (4) equity (loss) income in unconsolidated investments, net, (5) other non-operating items, net, (6) workforce restructuring expense, (7) M&A-related costs, (8) advisory fees related to activism defense, (9) spectrum repacking reimbursements and other, net, (10) depreciation and (11) amortization. We believe these adjustments facilitate company-to-company operating performance comparisons by removing potential differences caused by variations unrelated to operating performance, such as capital structures (interest expense), income taxes, and the age and book appreciation of property and equipment (and related depreciation expense). The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to Adjusted EBITDA is Net income attributable to TEGNA. Users should consider the limitations of using Adjusted EBITDA, including the fact that this measure does not provide a complete measure of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to purport to be an alternate to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. In particular, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of cash flow available for management's discretionary expenditures, as this measure does not consider certain cash requirements, such as working capital needs, capital expenditures, contractual commitments, interest payments, tax payments and other debt service requirements.\nWe also discuss free cash flow, a non-GAAP performance measure that the Board of Directors uses to review the performance of the business. Free cash flow is reviewed by the Board of Directors as a percentage of revenue over a trailing two-year period (reflecting both an even and odd year reporting period given the political cyclicality of our business). The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to free cash flow is Net income attributable to TEGNA. Free cash flow is calculated as non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA (as defined above), further adjusted by adding back (1) stock-based compensation, (2) non-cash 401(k) company match, (3) syndicated programming amortization, (4) pension reimbursements, (5) dividends received from equity method investments and (6) reimbursements from spectrum repacking.

The increase in free cash flow is primarily due to increases in retransmission and political revenue.\nFINANCIAL POSITION\nLiquidity and capital resources\nOur operations have historically generated strong positive cash flow which, along with availability under our existing revolving credit facility and cash and cash equivalents on hand, have been sufficient to fund our capital expenditures, interest expense, dividends, investments in strategic initiatives (including acquisitions) and other operating requirements.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had far-reaching impacts on many aspects of our operations, directly and indirectly, including our employees, consumer behavior, distribution of our content, our vendors, and the overall market. The full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly with regard to the broader advertising industry, remains uncertain and continues to evolve. However, during 2021, the U.S. economy continued on a path towards recovery with millions of Americans receiving COVID-19 vaccines, states and municipalities increasingly reopening and continued growth in employment, although the development of new variants of the virus continues to cause concern. In addition, the U.S. federal government continued to enact policies to provide fiscal stimulus to the economy and relief to those affected by the pandemic, with stimulus bolstering household finances as well as those of small businesses, states and municipalities.\nThe improving conditions around the pandemic, coupled with strategic actions we've taken with our 2020 and 2019 debt refinancings and reduction of discretionary spending, have helped strengthen our financial position. On March 29, 2021, we\nannounced that our Board of Directors approved a dividend increase of ten cents per share on an annual basis, to $0.38 per common share, which represents an approximately 36% increase above the prior dividend. We paid dividends totaling $78.5 million in 2021 and $76.5 million in 2020. We expect to continue to pay our regular quarterly dividend of $0.095 per share through the closing of the Merger, which is the maximum rate and frequency permitted by the Merger Agreement.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all covenants contained in our debt agreements and credit facility and our leverage ratio, calculated in accordance with our revolving credit agreement, was 3.19x, well below the permitted leverage ratio of less than 5.50x. The leverage ratio is calculated using annualized adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the agreement) for the trailing eight quarters. We believe that we will remain compliant with all covenants for the foreseeable future. Our financial and operating performance, as well as our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to maintain compliance with credit facility covenants, are subject to certain risk factors; see Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d for further discussion.\nContractual obligations\nAn important use of our liquidity pertains to purchasing programming rights. Most of our stations have network affiliations agreements with major broadcast networks (ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox). Under these agreements, the television networks produce and distribute programming to us in exchange for our stations commitments to air the programming at specified times and to pay the networks compensation at fixed or variable rates (such as a rate per number of MVPD subscribers accessing the programming). The network affiliation agreements generally have a three-year term. In addition, programming rights include acquired syndicated programming (television series and movies that are purchased on a group basis for use by our owned stations). These contracts typically cover a period of up to five years, with payments typically made over several years. As of December 31,2021, we had total programming commitments of $1.35 billion, of which $808.4 million will be settled within the next twelve months. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding programming commitments.\nWe also secure our on-air talent and other key personnel at our television stations through multi-year talent and employment agreements. We expect our contracts for talent and other key personnel will be renewed or replaced with similar agreements upon their expiration. As of December 31, 2021, amounts due under these contracts were approximately $236.8 million, of which approximately $133.6 million will be paid within the next twelve months.\nOther material contractual obligations include our operating leases (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further details) as well as our long-term debt and interest payments (see \u2018Long-term debt' section below, as well as Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further details).\nCash Flows\nThe following table provides a summary of our cash flow information for the three years ended December 31, 2021 followed by a discussion of the key elements of our cash flows (in thousands):\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash at beginning of year </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,968 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,404 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>135,862 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Net income </td> <td>478,197 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>482,763 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>286,235 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Depreciation, amortization and other non-cash adjustments </td> <td>204,461 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>202,189 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>156,858 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Pension expense, net of pension contribution </td> <td>(19,139) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10,400) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(19,447) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> (Increase) decrease in accounts receivable </td> <td>(88,687) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,474 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(86,245) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> (Decrease) increase in interest and taxes payable </td> <td>(53,303) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66,466 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,284) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Other, net </td> <td>(19,917) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,644 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31,644) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash flows from operating activities </td> <td>501,612 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>805,136 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>297,473 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payments for acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired </td> <td>(13,335) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(34,841) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,514,183) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All other investing activities </td> <td>(55,921) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(24,680) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(49,287) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used for investing activities </td> <td>(69,256) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(59,521) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,563,470) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used for) provided by financing activities </td> <td>(416,335) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(734,051) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,159,539 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash </td> <td>16,021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,564 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(106,458) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash at end of year </td> <td>$ </td> <td>56,989 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,968 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,404 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nCash flow from operating activities was $501.6 million in 2021, compared to $805.1 million in 2020. This $303.5 million decrease was primarily driven by a $385.0 million decrease in political revenue. As political advertisements are typically paid upfront, they provide an immediate benefit to operating cash flow as compared to non-political advertising which is billed and collected in arrears after the advertisement has been delivered. Also contributing to the decrease was an increase in tax payments of $94.3 million in 2021 as compared to 2020. This increase was driven by the adverse impact of COVID-19 on our 2020 financial results, particularly during the first six months of 2020. The subsequent recovery in demand for advertising thereafter resulted in an increase in our taxable income and led to the increase in tax payments in 2021. Partially offsetting the decline in operating cash flow was a $21.0 million decline in interest payments due to a lower average debt balance in 2021, mainly driven by a lower average balance on our revolving credit facility.\nInvesting Activities\nCash flow used for investing activities was $69.3 million in 2021, compared to $59.5 million in 2020. The increase of $9.8 million was primary due to a $17.6 million increase in the purchase of property and equipment, a decrease in spectrum reimbursement of $8.2 million and $21.5 million less being spent on acquisitions in 2021 as compared to 2020.\nFinancing Activities\nCash flow used for financing activities was $416.3 million in 2021, compared to $734.1 million in 2020. The change was primarily due to debt activity in 2020. Specifically, in January 2020 we issued $1.0 billion of unsecured notes, the proceeds of which were used to redeem $650.0 million of unsecured notes due in October 2023 and $310.0 million due in July 2020. Additionally, in September 2020 we issued $550 million of senior unsecured notes. In October 2020, we repaid the entire $350 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.875% senior unsecured notes due in 2021 and $188 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.500% senior unsecured notes due in 2024. We incurred fees of $41.4 million related to this debt activity and an amendment of the revolving credit facility.\nWe also had net repayments of $189.0 million on our revolving credit facility in 2021 as compared to net repayments of $548.0 million in 2020. In addition, in 2021 we repaid the remaining $137 million of our 5.500% unsecured senior notes, which were due in September 2024.\nFor a comparative discussion of changes in our cash flow comparing the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, see Part II, Item 7. Financial Position\u201d of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on March 1, 2021.\nLong-term debt\nAs of December 31, 2021, our total principal debt outstanding was $3.26 billion, cash and cash equivalents totaled $57.0 million, and we had unused borrowing capacity of $1.33 billion under our revolving credit facility, which is our primary source for funding short-term cash requirements. As of December 31, 2021, approximately $3.09 billion, or 95%, of our debt had a fixed interest rate. See Note 5 Long-term debt\u201d to our consolidated financial statements for a table summarizing the components of our long-term debt.\nOn December 3, 2021 we utilized available cash and our revolving credit facility to repay the remaining $137 million of our 5.500% unsecured senior notes, which were due in September 2024. We incurred $1.3 million of early redemption fees and wrote off $1.2 million of unamortized financing fees and discounts related to this early payoff of the 2024 notes.\nWe expect our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from our operations and borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our debt service obligations, capital expenditure requirements, and working capital needs for the next twelve months and beyond. Our interest payments may be repaid with cash flow from operating activities, accessing capital markets or a combination of both. Interest payments on the senior notes are based on the stated cash coupon rate. As of December 31, 2021, we had future interest payments on our senior notes of $1.00 billion, of which $160.3 million will be paid within the next twelve months. We also had $166.0 million of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2021. Future interest payments on the revolving credit facility are not known with certainty as payments into and out of the credit facility can change daily and interest payments are based on variable interest rates. For illustrative purposes, assuming the December 31, 2021 revolving credit facility balance does not change during 2022 and rates remain at the same level as those existing as of December 31, 2021, we estimate interest payments in 2022 will be approximately $5.3 million.\nThe following schedule discloses future annual maturities of the principal amount of total debt due (in thousands):\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Repayment schedule of principal long-term debt as of Dec. 31, 2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2022 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2023 </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2024 (1)\n</td> <td>166,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2025 </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2026 </td> <td>550,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Thereafter </td> <td>2,540,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,256,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Assumes the current revolving credit facility borrowings come due in 2024 and the revolving credit facility is not extended.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOff-balance sheet arrangements as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission include the following four categories: obligations under certain guarantee contracts; retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangements that serve as credit, liquidity or market risk support; obligations under certain derivative arrangements classified as equity; and obligations under material variable interests. As of December 31, 2021, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nCapital stock\nIn December 2020, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program for up to $300.0 million of our common stock over the next three years. From 2019 through 2021, no shares were repurchased. Certain of the shares we previously acquired have been reissued in settlement of employee stock awards. As a result of the announcement of the Merger Agreement on February 22, 2022, we have suspended share repurchases under this program.\nOur common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2021, totaled 221,406,177 shares, compared with 219,500,272 shares as of December 31, 2020.\nCritical accounting policies and estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. We believe the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are material to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's most subjective and complex judgments. This commentary should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the remainder of this Form 10-K.\nGoodwill: As of December 31, 2021, our goodwill balance was $2.98 billion and represented approximately 43% of our total assets. Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, net of liabilities assumed.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at a level referred to as the reporting unit. A reporting unit is a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results. The level at which we test goodwill for impairment requires us to determine whether the operations below the operating segment level constitute a reporting unit. We have determined that our one segment, Media, consists of a single reporting unit.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis (first day of our fourth quarter) or between annual tests if events or changes in circumstances occurred that indicate the fair value of a reporting unit may be below its carrying amount.\nBefore performing the annual goodwill impairment test quantitatively, we first have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if the quantitative test must be completed. The qualitative assessment considers events and circumstances such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors and overall financial performance, as well as company and specific reporting unit specifications. If after performing this assessment, we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we are required to perform the quantitative test. Otherwise, the quantitative test is not required. In 2021, we elected not to perform the optional qualitative assessment of goodwill and instead performed the quantitative impairment test.\nWhen performing the quantitative test, we determine the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, the reporting unit's goodwill is impaired and we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between the reporting unit's carrying amount and fair value.\nWe estimate the fair value of our one reporting unit based on a market-based valuation methodology, which is primarily based on our consolidated market capitalization plus a control premium. In the fourth quarter of 2021 we completed our annual goodwill impairment test for our reporting unit. The results of the test indicated that the estimated fair value of our reporting unit significantly exceeded the carrying value. We do not believe that the reporting unit is currently at risk of incurring a goodwill impairment in the foreseeable future.\nImpairment assessment inherently involves management judgments regarding the assumptions described above. Fair value of the reporting unit also depends on the future strength of the economy in our principal media markets. New and developing competition as well as technological change could also adversely affect our stock price and future fair value estimates.\nIndefinite Lived Intangibles: This category consists entirely of FCC broadcast licenses related to our acquisitions of television stations. As of December 31, 2021, indefinite lived intangible assets were $2.12 billion and represented approximately 31% of our total assets.\nThe FCC broadcast licenses are recorded at their estimated fair value as of the date of the business acquisition. We determine the fair value of each FCC broadcast license using an income approach referred to as the Greenfield method. The Greenfield method utilizes a discounted cash flow model that incorporates several key assumptions, including market revenues, long-term growth projections, estimated market share for a typical market participant, estimated profit margins based on market size and station type, and a discount rate (determined using a weighted average cost of capital). Because these licenses are considered indefinite lived intangible assets we do not amortize them. Instead, they are tested for impairment annually (on the first day of our fourth quarter), or more often if circumstances dictate, for impairment and written down to fair value as required.\nWe have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite lived asset is more than its carrying amount. If that is the case, then we do not need to perform the quantitative analysis. The qualitative assessment considers trends in macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors and overall financial performance of the indefinite lived asset. In 2021, we elected not to perform the optional qualitative assessment, and instead performed the quantitative impairment assessment for all of our FCC broadcast licenses. We have FCC licenses acquired in the KFMB-San Diego station acquisition in 2018 as well as those acquired in our 2019 acquisitions (Gray stations, Dispatch stations, and Nexstar stations), which represented an aggregate carrying value of $897.7 million. These licenses have more limited headroom due to the fact that we recently recorded them at fair value upon their respective acquisition, and as a result are more susceptible to the risk of impairment due to changes in underlying market factors.\nThe quantitative analysis performed included projected estimated economic impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. Changes in key fair value assumptions used in our analysis could result in future non-cash impairment charges, and any related impairment could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Changes in key fair value assumptions that could result in a future impairment charge include increases in discount rates and declines in market revenues. A 100 basis point increase in our discount rate or a 10% decline in market revenues (holding all other assumptions in the fair value model constant) would result in an aggregate impairment charge of approximately $17.0 million or less.\nPension Liabilities: Certain employees participate in qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans (see Note 6 to consolidated financial statements). Our principal defined benefit pension plan is the TEGNA Retirement Plan (TRP). We also sponsor the TEGNA Supplemental Retirement Plan (SERP) for certain employees. Substantially all participants in the TRP and SERP had their benefits frozen before 2009, and in December 2017, we froze all remaining accruing benefits for certain grandfathered SERP participants.\nWe recognize the net funded status of these postretirement benefit plans as a liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. There is a corresponding non-cash adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax benefits recorded as deferred tax assets, in stockholders' equity. The funded status represents the difference between the fair value of each plan's assets and the benefit obligation of the plan. The benefit obligation represents the present value of the estimated future benefits we currently expect to pay to plan participants based on past service.\nThe plan assets and benefit obligations are measured as of December 31 of each year, or more frequently, upon the occurrence of certain events such as a plan amendment, settlement, or curtailment. The amounts we record are measured using actuarial valuations, which are dependent upon key assumptions such as discount rates, participant mortality rates and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The assumptions we make affect both the calculation of the benefit obligations as of the measurement date and the calculation of net periodic pension expense in subsequent periods. When reassessing these assumptions we consider past and current market conditions and make judgments about future market trends. We also consider factors such as the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants.\nThe most important assumptions include the discount rate applied to pension plan obligations and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets related for the TRP (the SERP is an unfunded plan). The discount rate assumption is based on investment yields available at year-end on corporate bonds rated AA and above with a maturity to match the expected benefit payment stream. A decrease in discount rates would increase pension obligations.\nWe establish the expected long-term rate of return by developing a forward-looking, long-term return assumption for each pension fund asset class, taking into account factors such as the expected real return for the specific asset class and inflation. A single, long-term rate of return is then calculated as the weighted average of the target asset allocation percentages and the long-term return assumption for each asset class. We apply the expected long-term rate of return to the fair value of its pension assets in determining the dollar amount of its expected return. Changes in the expected long-term return on plan assets would increase or decrease pension plan expense. For 2021, we assumed a rate of 6.50% for our long-term expected return on pension assets used for our TRP plan. As an indication of the sensitivity of pension expense to the long-term rate of return assumption, a plus or minus 50 basis points change in the expected rate of return on pension assets (with all other assumptions held constant) would have decreased or increased estimated pension plan expense for 2021 by approximately $2.7 million. The effects of actual results differing from this assumption is accumulated as unamortized gains and losses.\nFor the December 31, 2021 measurement, the assumption used for the discount rate was 2.89% for our TRP and SERP plans. As an indication of the sensitivity of pension liabilities to the discount rate assumption, a plus or minus 50 basis points change in the discount rate as of the end of 2021 (with all other assumptions held constant) would have decreased or increased plan obligations by approximately $30.9 million. For 2021, the discount rate used to determine the pension expense was 2.54%. A 50 basis points increase or decrease in this discount rate would have decreased or increased total pension plan expense for 2021 by approximately $0.6 million.\nIncome Taxes: Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates, and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions.\nTax law requires certain items to be included in our tax returns at different times than when the items are reflected in the financial statements. The annual tax expense reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income is different than that reported in our tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent (for example, expenses recorded for accounting purposes that are not deductible in the returns such as certain entertainment expenses) and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements, as well as tax losses that can be carried over and used in future years. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amounts we believe are more likely than not to be recovered. In evaluating the amount of any such valuation allowance, we consider the existence of cumulative income or losses in recent years, the reversal of existing temporary differences, the existence of taxable income in prior carry back years, available tax planning strategies and estimates of future taxable income for each of our taxable jurisdictions. The latter two factors involve the exercise of significant judgment. As of December 31, 2021, deferred tax asset valuation allowances totaled $41.9 million, primarily related to federal and state capital losses, accrued compensation costs, minority investments, state interest disallowance carryovers, and state net operating losses available for carry forward to future years. Although realization is not assured, we believe it is more likely than not that all other deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowances have been established will be realized. This conclusion is based on our history of cumulative income in recent years and review of historical and projected future taxable income.\nWe determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities before any part of the benefit is recorded in our financial statements. A tax position is measured as the portion of the tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement with a taxing authority (that has full knowledge of all relevant information). We may be required to change our provision for income taxes when the ultimate treatment of certain items is challenged or agreed to by taxing authorities, when estimates used in determining valuation allowances on deferred tax assets significantly change, or when receipt of new information indicates the need for adjustment in valuation allowances. Future events, such as changes in tax laws, tax regulations, or interpretations of such laws or regulations, could have an impact on the provision for income tax and the effective tax rate. Any such changes could significantly affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements in the year these changes occur.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIntroduction\nWe are an innovative media company serving the greater good of our communities. Across platforms, we tell empowering stories, conduct impactful investigations and deliver innovative marketing services. With 64 television stations and two radio stations in 51 U.S. markets, we are the largest owner of top four network affiliates in the top 25 markets among independent station groups, reaching approximately 39% of U.S. television households. We also own leading multicast networks True Crime Network, Twist and Quest. Each television station also has a robust digital presence across online, mobile and social platforms, reaching consumers on all devices and platforms they use to consume news content. We have been consistently honored with the industry's top awards, including Edward R. Murrow, George Polk, Alfred I. DuPont and Emmy Awards. Through TEGNA Marketing Solutions (TMS), our integrated sales and back-end fulfillment operations, we deliver results for advertisers across television, digital and over-the-top (OTT) platforms, including Premion, our OTT advertising network.\nWe have one operating and reportable segment. The primary sources of our revenues are: 1) subscription revenues, reflecting fees paid by satellite, cable, OTT (companies that deliver video content to consumers over the Internet) and telecommunications providers to carry our television signals on their systems; 2) advertising & marketing services (AMS) revenues, which include local and national non-political television advertising, digital marketing services (including Premion), and advertising on stations' websites, tablet and mobile products and OTT apps; 3) political advertising revenues, which are driven by even-year election cycles at the local and national level (e.g., 2022, 2020. etc.) and particularly in the second half of those years; and 4) other services, such as production of programming, tower rentals and distribution of our local news content.\nOn February 22, 2022, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Parent, Merger Sub, and solely for purposes of certain provisions specified therein, other subsidiaries of Parent, certain affiliates Standard General and CMG and certain of its subsidiaries. We currently expect the transaction, which is subject to stockholder and regulatory approvals, and other customary closing conditions, to close in the second half of 2022. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d and Note 12 - Subsequent Event of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this report.\nCOVID-19 pandemic\nSince early 2020, the world has been, and continues to be, impacted by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and its variants. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges including widespread economic and social change throughout the United States. The U.S. economy continued on a path to recovery during 2021 with millions of Americans receiving COVID-19 vaccines, states/municipalities increasingly reopening and continued growth in employment. In addition, the U.S. federal government continued to enact policies to provide fiscal stimulus to the economy and relief to those affected by the pandemic, with the stimulus bolstering household finances as well as those of small businesses, states and municipalities. Our AMS revenues were most negatively impacted by the pandemic early in the second quarter of 2020 but since then AMS revenues have improved significantly as economic re-opening accelerated.\nThe impact of COVID-19 and the extent of its adverse impact on our financial and operating results will be dictated by the degree to which the pandemic continues to affect our advertising customers. This will depend on future pandemic-related developments including the severity of COVID-19 variants, disruptions to our customers' supply chains and impacts to their advertising and marketing purchasing patterns, the effectiveness, distribution and acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines and booster shots, consumer confidence, and U.S. government actions to prevent and manage the virus spread, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. While we use the best information available in developing significant estimates included in our financial statements, the effects of the pandemic on our operations may not be fully realized, or reflected in our financial results, until future periods. As such, actual results could differ from our estimates and these differences resulting from changes in facts and circumstances could be material.\nSeasonality: Our revenues and operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations. Generally, our second and fourth quarter operating results are stronger than those of the first and third quarter. This is driven by the second quarter reflecting increased spring seasonal advertising, while the fourth quarter typically includes increased advertising related to the holiday season. In addition, our revenue and operating results are subject to significant fluctuations across yearly periods resulting from political advertising. In even numbered years, political spending is usually significantly higher than in odd numbered years due to advertising for the local and national elections. Additionally, every four years, we typically experience even greater increases in political advertising in connection with the presidential election. The strong demand for advertising from political advertisers in these even years can result in the significant use of our available inventory (leading to a crowd out\u201d effect), which can diminish our AMS revenue in the even year of a two year election cycle, particularly in the fourth quarter of those years.\nConsolidated Results from Operations\nThe following discussion is a comparison of our consolidated results on a GAAP basis. The year-to-year comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of future results. In addition, see the section on page 32 titled \u2018Operating results non-GAAP information' for additional tables presenting information which supplements our financial information provided on a GAAP basis.\nAs discussed above, our operating results are subject to significant fluctuations across yearly periods (driven by even-year election cycles). As such, in addition to one year ago comparisons, our management team and Board of Directors also review current period operating results compared to the same period two years ago (e.g., 2021 vs. 2019). We believe this comparison will also provide useful information to investors, and therefore, we have supplemented our prior year comparison of consolidated results to also include a comparison against 2019 results (through operating income).\nDuring 2019, we acquired multiple local television stations and multicast networks. Specifically, we acquired certain stations divested by Gray (January 2, 2019), the Justice Network (rebranded as True Crime Network) and Quest multicast networks (June 18, 2019), the Dispatch stations (August 8, 2019) and certain stations divested by Nexstar (September 19, 2019). The multicast networks, Dispatch stations, and Nexstar stations are collectively referred to as the 2019 Acquisitions\u201d in the discussion that follows. These 2019 Acquisitions did not contribute to the periods prior to their acquisition in our financial statements which impacts 2021 to 2019 comparability of our consolidated operating results. The Gray stations do not impact the 2021 to 2019 comparability.\nFor a comparative discussion of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, see Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on March 1, 2021.\nA consolidated summary of our results is presented below (in thousands, except per share amounts):\n\n*** Not meaningful\nRevenues\nOur Subscription revenue category includes revenue earned from cable and satellite providers for the right to carry our signals and the distribution of TEGNA stations on OTT streaming services. Our AMS category includes all sources of our traditional television advertising and digital revenues including Premion and other digital advertising and marketing revenues across our platforms.\nThe following table summarizes the year-over-year changes in our revenue categories (in thousands):\n\n2021 vs. 2020\nTotal revenues increased $53.3 million in 2021. The net increase was primarily due to $253.3 million growth in AMS reflecting higher demand for television and digital advertising, year over year. Growth in subscription revenue of $179.8 million was primarily due to annual rate increases under existing and newly renegotiated retransmission agreements, partially offset by declines in subscribers including the impact of an outage with a broadcast satellite provider that began on October 6, 2021 and ended in early 2022. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in political revenue of $385.0 million, following the 2020 presidential election year.\n2021 vs. 2019\nTotal revenues increased $691.6 million in 2021. Our 2019 Acquisitions contributed $306.2 million to this increase. Excluding the 2019 Acquisitions, total revenues increased $385.4 million. This increase was primarily due to a $303.5 million increase in legacy subscription revenue from annual rate increases under existing and newly renegotiated retransmission agreements, partially offset by declines in subscribers including the impact of an outage with a broadcast satellite provider that began on October 6, 2021 and ended in early 2022. Also contributing to the increase was a $51.5 million increase in AMS revenue, driven in part by Premion, and a $21.9 million increase in political advertising revenue.\nCost of revenues\n2021 vs. 2020\nCost of revenues increased $95.5 million in 2021. This increase was primarily due to a $72.8 million growth in programming costs driven by a contractual increase in rates under existing and newly renegotiated affiliation agreements and growth in subscription revenues (certain programming costs are linked to such revenues). Higher digital expenses of $7.6 million driven by growth in Premion also contributed to the increase.\n2021 vs. 2019\nCost of revenues increased $370.5 million in 2021. Our 2019 Acquisitions contributed $164.5 million to this increase. Excluding the 2019 Acquisitions, cost of revenues increased $206.0 million. This increase was primarily due to a $179.2 million increase in programming costs driven by a contractual increase in rates under existing and newly renegotiated affiliation agreements and growth in subscription revenues (certain programming costs are linked to such revenues). Higher digital expenses of $12.6 million driven by growth in Premion also contributed to the increase.\nBusiness units - Selling, general and administrative expenses\n2021 vs. 2020\nBusiness unit selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased $30.8 million in 2021. The increase was primarily due to a $13.9 million increase in legal and professional fees. Marketing costs also rose $8.0 million. Sales commissions and other selling costs also increased by $23.1 million driven by growth in AMS revenues. These increases were partially offset by a $8.7 million reduction in bad debt expense attributed to improved collections.\n2021 vs. 2019\nBusiness unit SG&A expenses increased $69.6 million in 2021. Our 2019 Acquisitions added business unit SG&A expenses of $32.9 million. Excluding the 2019 Acquisitions, SG&A expenses increased $36.7 million. The increase was primarily the result of a $20.6 million increase in legal and professional fees. Sales commissions and other selling costs increased by $18.0 million driven by growth in AMS revenues. Stock based compensation expense was also higher by $3.9 million, driven by our higher stock price.\nCorporate - General and administrative expenses\nOur corporate costs are separated from our direct business expenses and are recorded as general and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Income. This category primarily consists of corporate management and support functions including Legal, Human Resources, and Finance, as well as activities and costs not directly attributable to the operations of our media business.\n2021 vs. 2020\nCorporate general and administrative expenses decreased $5.2 million in 2021. The decrease was primarily driven by a $6.5 million reduction in advisory fees related to activism defense, and reduction of $0.9 million of M&A-related costs. Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in stock based compensation expense of $2.2 million driven by our higher stock price.\n2021 vs. 2019\nCorporate general and administrative expenses decreased $12.0 million in 2021. The decrease was primarily due to the absence of acquisition-related costs of $30.8 million due to the reduction in acquisition activity in 2021. Partially offsetting this decrease were increases of $10.5 million in advisory fees related to activism defense, $3.7 million in M&A-related costs and $1.8 million in stock based compensation expense due to our higher stock price.\nDepreciation expense\n2021 vs. 2020\nDepreciation expense decreased $2.0 million in 2021 due to a decline in capital expenditures resulting in less depreciation in 2021 as fewer new assets were placed in service.\n2021 vs. 2019\nDepreciation expense increased $4.3 million in 2021 driven by our 2019 Acquisitions which contributed $8.0 million to the increase. Excluding the impact of 2019 Acquisitions, depreciation expense decreased $3.7 million due to a decline in capital expenditures following the onset of COVID-19, resulting in less depreciation in 2021 as fewer new assets were placed in service.\nAmortization of intangible assets\n2021 vs. 2020\nIntangible asset amortization expense decreased $4.7 million in 2021. The decrease is due to certain assets reaching the end of their assumed useful lives and therefore becoming fully amortized.\n2021 vs. 2019\nIntangible asset amortization expense increased $12.9 million in 2021. Our 2019 Acquisitions contributed $23.1 million to this increase. Excluding the impact of the 2019 Acquisitions, amortization expense decreased $10.2 million due to certain assets reaching the end of their assumed useful lives.\nSpectrum repacking reimbursements and other, net\n2021 vs. 2020\nWe had other net gains of $2.3 million in 2021 compared to net gains of $10.0 million in 2020. The 2021 activity is related to $4.9 million of reimbursements received from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for required spectrum repacking, partially offset by a $1.5 million contract termination fee and a $1.1 million write off of certain assets. The 2020 net gains primarily consisted of $13.2 million of reimbursements received from the FCC for required spectrum repacking, partially offset by a $2.1 million impairment charge due to the retirement of a brand name and a $1.1 million FCC license impairment charge.\n2021 vs. 2019\nWe had other net gains of $2.3 million in 2021 compared to net gains of $5.3 million in 2019. The 2021 activity consists of the items discussed above. The 2019 net gains consisted of gains of $17.0 million of reimbursements received from the FCC for required spectrum repacking and a gain of $2.9 million as a result of the sale of certain real estate. These gains were partially offset by a $5.5 million in contract termination charge and transition costs related to bringing our national sales organization in-house and $9.1 million of non-cash charges to reduce the value of certain assets classified as held-for-sale.\nOperating income\n2021 vs. 2020\nOur operating income decreased $68.8 million in 2021. This decrease was driven by the changes in revenue and expenses discussed above, but primarily due to a decline in high-margin political revenue.\n2021 vs. 2019\nOperating income increased $243.2 million in 2021. Results from our 2019 Acquisitions added operating income of $77.8 million. Excluding the 2019 Acquisitions, operating income increased $165.4 million, driven by the changes in revenue and expenses discussed above, most notably the increases in subscription revenue.\nProgramming and payroll expense trends\nProgramming and payroll expenses are the two largest elements of our operating expenses, and are summarized below, expressed as a percentage of total operating expenses. Programming expenses as a percentage of total operating expenses have increased due to an increase in reverse compensation payments to our network affiliation partners. Payroll expenses have increased during 2021, but as a percentage of total operating expenses have decreased in 2021 primarily due to increases in programming expenses, which make up a larger percentage of operating costs.\n\nNon-operating income and expense\nEquity income: This income statement category reflects earnings or losses from our equity method investments. Equity income decreased from $10.4 million in 2020 to a loss of $9.7 million in 2021. The 2021 loss was primarily due to equity loss from our CareerBuilder investment. The 2020 income was primarily due to equity income from our CareerBuilder investment (recognizing gains driven by the sale of several subsidiary businesses).\nInterest expense: Interest expense decreased $24.6 million in 2021 as compared to 2020, primarily due to a lower average outstanding total debt balance, partially offset by higher interest rates. The total average outstanding debt was $3.41 billion in 2021 compared to $4.02 billion in 2020. The impact of the decrease in outstanding debt was partially offset by an increase in the weighted average interest rate on total outstanding debt, which was 5.15% in 2021 compared to 5.03% in 2020.\nA further discussion of our borrowing and related interest cost is presented in the Liquidity and capital resources\u201d section of this report beginning on page 36 and in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.\nOther non-operating items, net: Other non-operating items increased $40.9 million from a net loss of $34.0 million in 2020 to a net income of $6.8 million in 2021. This change was comprised of 2020 charges absent in 2021 including a $17.3 million call premium related to the repayment of our 2023 and 2024 unsecured senior notes; and acceleration of $11.8 million of previously deferred financing fees associated with early repayment of unsecured senior notes. In addition, the increase was driven by the absence of a $9.2 million impairment of an equity investment in 2020.\nProvision for income taxes\nWe reported pre-tax income of $613.7 million for 2021. The effective tax rate on pre-tax income was 22.1%. The 2021 effective tax rate decreased compared to 24.2% in 2020 primarily due to tax benefits realized as a result of state tax planning strategies and related to a previously-disposed business. Further information concerning income tax matters is contained in Note 4 of the consolidated financial statements.\nNet income\nNet income and related per share amounts are presented in the table below (in thousands, except per share amounts):\n\nOur 2021 earnings per share were lower than 2020 due to the factors discussed above including, most notably, the decrease in political revenue following the 2020 presidential election year, partially offset by increases in AMS revenue reflecting higher demand for television and digital advertising (as fiscal year 2020 was adversely impacted by reduced demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic) and increase in subscription revenue from annual rate increases under existing and newly renegotiated retransmission agreements.\nOperating results non-GAAP information\nPresentation of non-GAAP information: We use non-GAAP financial performance measures to supplement the financial information presented on a GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the related GAAP measures, nor should they be considered superior to the related GAAP measures, and should be read together with financial information presented on a GAAP basis. Also, our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nManagement and our Board of Directors use the non-GAAP financial measures for purposes of evaluating company performance. Furthermore, the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors uses non-GAAP measures such as Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP EPS, and free cash flow to evaluate management's performance. Therefore, we believe that each of the non-GAAP measures presented provides useful information to investors and other stakeholders by allowing them to view our business through the eyes of management and our Board of Directors, facilitating comparisons of results across historical periods and focus on the underlying ongoing operating performance of our business. We also believe these non-GAAP measures are frequently used by investors, securities analysts and other interested parties in their evaluation of our business and other companies in the broadcast industry.\nWe discuss in this Form 10-K non-GAAP financial performance measures that exclude from our reported GAAP results the impact of special items\u201d which are described in detail below in the section titled Discussion of special charges and credits affecting reporting results\u201d. We believe that such expenses and gains are not indicative of normal, ongoing operations. While these items may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in evaluation of our earnings performance, it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results and trends compared to other periods as these items can vary significantly from period to period depending on specific underlying transactions or events that may occur. Therefore, while we may incur or recognize these types of expenses, charges and gains in the future, we believe that removing these items for purposes of calculating the non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with a more focused presentation of our ongoing operating performance.\nWe discuss Adjusted EBITDA (with and without corporate expenses), a non-GAAP financial performance measure that we believe offers a useful view of the overall operation of our businesses. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to TEGNA before (1) net (income) loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest, (2) income taxes, (3) interest expense, (4) equity (loss) income in unconsolidated investments, net, (5) other non-operating items, net, (6) workforce restructuring expense, (7) M&A-related costs, (8) advisory fees related to activism defense, (9) spectrum repacking reimbursements and other, net, (10) depreciation and (11) amortization. We believe these adjustments facilitate company-to-company operating performance comparisons by removing potential differences caused by variations unrelated to operating performance, such as capital structures (interest expense), income taxes, and the age and book appreciation of property and equipment (and related depreciation expense). The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to Adjusted EBITDA is Net income attributable to TEGNA. Users should consider the limitations of using Adjusted EBITDA, including the fact that this measure does not provide a complete measure of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to purport to be an alternate to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. In particular, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of cash flow available for management's discretionary expenditures, as this measure does not consider certain cash requirements, such as working capital needs, capital expenditures, contractual commitments, interest payments, tax payments and other debt service requirements.\nWe also discuss free cash flow, a non-GAAP performance measure that the Board of Directors uses to review the performance of the business. Free cash flow is reviewed by the Board of Directors as a percentage of revenue over a trailing two-year period (reflecting both an even and odd year reporting period given the political cyclicality of our business). The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to free cash flow is Net income attributable to TEGNA. Free cash flow is calculated as non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA (as defined above), further adjusted by adding back (1) stock-based compensation, (2) non-cash 401(k) company match, (3) syndicated programming amortization, (4) pension reimbursements, (5) dividends received from equity method investments and (6) reimbursements from spectrum repacking. This is further adjusted by deducting payments made for (1) syndicated programming, (2) pension, (3) interest, (4) taxes (net of refunds) and (5) purchases of property and equipment. Like Adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow is not intended to be a measure of cash flow available for management's discretionary use.\nDiscussion of special charges and credits affecting reported results: Our results during 2021 and 2020 included the following items we consider special items\u201d that while at times recurring, can vary significantly from period to period:\nResults for the year ended December 31, 2021:\n\u2022Spectrum repacking reimbursements and other, net consisting of gains due to reimbursements from the FCC for required spectrum repacking, a contract termination fee and the write off of certain fixed assets;\n\u2022Advisory fees related to activism defense;\n\u2022M&A-related costs we incurred to assist prospective buyers of our company with their due diligence;\n\u2022Other non-operating items consisting of a gain due to an observable price increase in an equity investment and costs incurred in connection with the early extinguishment of debt; and\n\u2022Net deferred tax benefits as a result of state tax planning strategies implemented during 2021, deferred tax benefits related to partial capital loss valuation allowance release, and return to provision and deferred adjustments related to the completion of our 2020 state tax returns.\nResults for the year ended December 31, 2020:\n\u2022Workforce restructuring expense which included payroll and related benefit costs at our stations (including the shutdown of our TMS Phoenix operations) and corporate headquarters;\n\u2022M&A-related costs we incurred to assist prospective buyers of our company with their due diligence;\n\u2022Advisory fees related to activism defense;\n\u2022Spectrum repacking reimbursements and other, net consists of gains due to reimbursements from the FCC for required spectrum repacking, partially offset by an intangible asset impairment charge due to the retirement of a brand name and an FCC license impairment charge related to a radio station;\n\u2022Gains recognized in our equity income in unconsolidated investments, primarily related to our share of CareerBuilder's gain on the sale of certain subsidiary businesses;\n\u2022Other non-operating items primarily related to costs incurred in connection with the early extinguishment of debt, and an impairment charge related to one of our investments; and\n\u2022Deferred tax benefits related to partial capital loss valuation allowance release.\nBelow are reconciliations of certain line items impacted by special items to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP on our Consolidated Statements of Income (in thousands, except per share amounts):\n\nNon-GAAP consolidated results\nThe following is a comparison of our as adjusted non-GAAP financial results between 2021 and 2020. Changes between the periods are driven by the same factors summarized above in the Results of Operations\u201d section within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (in thousands, except per share amounts).\n\nAdjusted EBITDA - Non-GAAP\nReconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA (inclusive and exclusive of Corporate expenses) to net income attributable to TEGNA Inc. presented in accordance with GAAP on our Consolidated Statements of Income is presented below (in thousands):\n\n*** Not meaningful\nAdjusted EBITDA margin was 33% (without corporate expense) and 32% including corporate. Our total Adjusted EBITDA decreased $76.2 million or 7% in 2021 compared to 2020. This decrease was primarily driven by the operational factors discussed above within the revenue and operating expense fluctuation explanation sections, most notably, the decrease in political revenue in 2021, following the 2020 presidential election year.\nFree cash flow reconciliation\nReconciliations from Net income attributable to TEGNA Inc.\u201d to Free cash flow\u201d are presented below (in thousands):\n\nOur free cash flow, a non-GAAP performance measure, was $1.32 billion and $1.12 billion for the two-year periods ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in free cash flow is primarily due to increases in retransmission and political revenue.\nFINANCIAL POSITION\nLiquidity and capital resources\nOur operations have historically generated strong positive cash flow which, along with availability under our existing revolving credit facility and cash and cash equivalents on hand, have been sufficient to fund our capital expenditures, interest expense, dividends, investments in strategic initiatives (including acquisitions) and other operating requirements.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had far-reaching impacts on many aspects of our operations, directly and indirectly, including our employees, consumer behavior, distribution of our content, our vendors, and the overall market. The full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly with regard to the broader advertising industry, remains uncertain and continues to evolve. However, during 2021, the U.S. economy continued on a path towards recovery with millions of Americans receiving COVID-19 vaccines, states and municipalities increasingly reopening and continued growth in employment, although the development of new variants of the virus continues to cause concern. In addition, the U.S. federal government continued to enact policies to provide fiscal stimulus to the economy and relief to those affected by the pandemic, with stimulus bolstering household finances as well as those of small businesses, states and municipalities.\nThe improving conditions around the pandemic, coupled with strategic actions we've taken with our 2020 and 2019 debt refinancings and reduction of discretionary spending, have helped strengthen our financial position. On March 29, 2021, we\nannounced that our Board of Directors approved a dividend increase of ten cents per share on an annual basis, to $0.38 per common share, which represents an approximately 36% increase above the prior dividend. We paid dividends totaling $78.5 million in 2021 and $76.5 million in 2020. We expect to continue to pay our regular quarterly dividend of $0.095 per share through the closing of the Merger, which is the maximum rate and frequency permitted by the Merger Agreement.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all covenants contained in our debt agreements and credit facility and our leverage ratio, calculated in accordance with our revolving credit agreement, was 3.19x, well below the permitted leverage ratio of less than 5.50x. The leverage ratio is calculated using annualized adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the agreement) for the trailing eight quarters. We believe that we will remain compliant with all covenants for the foreseeable future. Our financial and operating performance, as well as our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to maintain compliance with credit facility covenants, are subject to certain risk factors; see Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d for further discussion.\nContractual obligations\nAn important use of our liquidity pertains to purchasing programming rights. Most of our stations have network affiliations agreements with major broadcast networks (ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox). Under these agreements, the television networks produce and distribute programming to us in exchange for our stations commitments to air the programming at specified times and to pay the networks compensation at fixed or variable rates (such as a rate per number of MVPD subscribers accessing the programming). The network affiliation agreements generally have a three-year term. In addition, programming rights include acquired syndicated programming (television series and movies that are purchased on a group basis for use by our owned stations). These contracts typically cover a period of up to five years, with payments typically made over several years. As of December 31,2021, we had total programming commitments of $1.35 billion, of which $808.4 million will be settled within the next twelve months. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding programming commitments.\nWe also secure our on-air talent and other key personnel at our television stations through multi-year talent and employment agreements. We expect our contracts for talent and other key personnel will be renewed or replaced with similar agreements upon their expiration. As of December 31, 2021, amounts due under these contracts were approximately $236.8 million, of which approximately $133.6 million will be paid within the next twelve months.\nOther material contractual obligations include our operating leases (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further details) as well as our long-term debt and interest payments (see \u2018Long-term debt' section below, as well as Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further details).\nCash Flows\nThe following table provides a summary of our cash flow information for the three years ended December 31, 2021 followed by a discussion of the key elements of our cash flows (in thousands):\n\nOperating Activities\nCash flow from operating activities was $501.6 million in 2021, compared to $805.1 million in 2020. This $303.5 million decrease was primarily driven by a $385.0 million decrease in political revenue. As political advertisements are typically paid upfront, they provide an immediate benefit to operating cash flow as compared to non-political advertising which is billed and collected in arrears after the advertisement has been delivered. Also contributing to the decrease was an increase in tax payments of $94.3 million in 2021 as compared to 2020. This increase was driven by the adverse impact of COVID-19 on our 2020 financial results, particularly during the first six months of 2020. The subsequent recovery in demand for advertising thereafter resulted in an increase in our taxable income and led to the increase in tax payments in 2021. Partially offsetting the decline in operating cash flow was a $21.0 million decline in interest payments due to a lower average debt balance in 2021, mainly driven by a lower average balance on our revolving credit facility.\nInvesting Activities\nCash flow used for investing activities was $69.3 million in 2021, compared to $59.5 million in 2020. The increase of $9.8 million was primary due to a $17.6 million increase in the purchase of property and equipment, a decrease in spectrum reimbursement of $8.2 million and $21.5 million less being spent on acquisitions in 2021 as compared to 2020.\nFinancing Activities\nCash flow used for financing activities was $416.3 million in 2021, compared to $734.1 million in 2020. The change was primarily due to debt activity in 2020. Specifically, in January 2020 we issued $1.0 billion of unsecured notes, the proceeds of which were used to redeem $650.0 million of unsecured notes due in October 2023 and $310.0 million due in July 2020. Additionally, in September 2020 we issued $550 million of senior unsecured notes. In October 2020, we repaid the entire $350 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.875% senior unsecured notes due in 2021 and $188 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.500% senior unsecured notes due in 2024. We incurred fees of $41.4 million related to this debt activity and an amendment of the revolving credit facility.\nWe also had net repayments of $189.0 million on our revolving credit facility in 2021 as compared to net repayments of $548.0 million in 2020. In addition, in 2021 we repaid the remaining $137 million of our 5.500% unsecured senior notes, which were due in September 2024.\nFor a comparative discussion of changes in our cash flow comparing the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, see Part II, Item 7. Financial Position\u201d of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on March 1, 2021.\nLong-term debt\nAs of December 31, 2021, our total principal debt outstanding was $3.26 billion, cash and cash equivalents totaled $57.0 million, and we had unused borrowing capacity of $1.33 billion under our revolving credit facility, which is our primary source for funding short-term cash requirements. As of December 31, 2021, approximately $3.09 billion, or 95%, of our debt had a fixed interest rate. See Note 5 Long-term debt\u201d to our consolidated financial statements for a table summarizing the components of our long-term debt.\nOn December 3, 2021 we utilized available cash and our revolving credit facility to repay the remaining $137 million of our 5.500% unsecured senior notes, which were due in September 2024. We incurred $1.3 million of early redemption fees and wrote off $1.2 million of unamortized financing fees and discounts related to this early payoff of the 2024 notes.\nWe expect our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from our operations and borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our debt service obligations, capital expenditure requirements, and working capital needs for the next twelve months and beyond. Our interest payments may be repaid with cash flow from operating activities, accessing capital markets or a combination of both. Interest payments on the senior notes are based on the stated cash coupon rate. As of December 31, 2021, we had future interest payments on our senior notes of $1.00 billion, of which $160.3 million will be paid within the next twelve months. We also had $166.0 million of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2021. Future interest payments on the revolving credit facility are not known with certainty as payments into and out of the credit facility can change daily and interest payments are based on variable interest rates. For illustrative purposes, assuming the December 31, 2021 revolving credit facility balance does not change during 2022 and rates remain at the same level as those existing as of December 31, 2021, we estimate interest payments in 2022 will be approximately $5.3 million.\nThe following schedule discloses future annual maturities of the principal amount of total debt due (in thousands):\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOff-balance sheet arrangements as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission include the following four categories: obligations under certain guarantee contracts; retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangements that serve as credit, liquidity or market risk support; obligations under certain derivative arrangements classified as equity; and obligations under material variable interests. As of December 31, 2021, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nCapital stock\nIn December 2020, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program for up to $300.0 million of our common stock over the next three years. From 2019 through 2021, no shares were repurchased. Certain of the shares we previously acquired have been reissued in settlement of employee stock awards. As a result of the announcement of the Merger Agreement on February 22, 2022, we have suspended share repurchases under this program.\nOur common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2021, totaled 221,406,177 shares, compared with 219,500,272 shares as of December 31, 2020.\nCritical accounting policies and estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. We believe the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are material to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's most subjective and complex judgments. This commentary should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the remainder of this Form 10-K.\nGoodwill: As of December 31, 2021, our goodwill balance was $2.98 billion and represented approximately 43% of our total assets. Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, net of liabilities assumed.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at a level referred to as the reporting unit. A reporting unit is a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results. The level at which we test goodwill for impairment requires us to determine whether the operations below the operating segment level constitute a reporting unit. We have determined that our one segment, Media, consists of a single reporting unit.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis (first day of our fourth quarter) or between annual tests if events or changes in circumstances occurred that indicate the fair value of a reporting unit may be below its carrying amount.\nBefore performing the annual goodwill impairment test quantitatively, we first have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if the quantitative test must be completed. The qualitative assessment considers events and circumstances such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors and overall financial performance, as well as company and specific reporting unit specifications. If after performing this assessment, we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we are required to perform the quantitative test. Otherwise, the quantitative test is not required. In 2021, we elected not to perform the optional qualitative assessment of goodwill and instead performed the quantitative impairment test.\nWhen performing the quantitative test, we determine the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, the reporting unit's goodwill is impaired and we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between the reporting unit's carrying amount and fair value.\nWe estimate the fair value of our one reporting unit based on a market-based valuation methodology, which is primarily based on our consolidated market capitalization plus a control premium. In the fourth quarter of 2021 we completed our annual goodwill impairment test for our reporting unit. The results of the test indicated that the estimated fair value of our reporting unit significantly exceeded the carrying value. We do not believe that the reporting unit is currently at risk of incurring a goodwill impairment in the foreseeable future.\nImpairment assessment inherently involves management judgments regarding the assumptions described above. Fair value of the reporting unit also depends on the future strength of the economy in our principal media markets. New and developing competition as well as technological change could also adversely affect our stock price and future fair value estimates.\nIndefinite Lived Intangibles: This category consists entirely of FCC broadcast licenses related to our acquisitions of television stations. As of December 31, 2021, indefinite lived intangible assets were $2.12 billion and represented approximately 31% of our total assets.\nThe FCC broadcast licenses are recorded at their estimated fair value as of the date of the business acquisition. We determine the fair value of each FCC broadcast license using an income approach referred to as the Greenfield method. The Greenfield method utilizes a discounted cash flow model that incorporates several key assumptions, including market revenues, long-term growth projections, estimated market share for a typical market participant, estimated profit margins based on market size and station type, and a discount rate (determined using a weighted average cost of capital). Because these licenses are considered indefinite lived intangible assets we do not amortize them. Instead, they are tested for impairment annually (on the first day of our fourth quarter), or more often if circumstances dictate, for impairment and written down to fair value as required.\nWe have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite lived asset is more than its carrying amount. If that is the case, then we do not need to perform the quantitative analysis. The qualitative assessment considers trends in macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors and overall financial performance of the indefinite lived asset. In 2021, we elected not to perform the optional qualitative assessment, and instead performed the quantitative impairment assessment for all of our FCC broadcast licenses. We have FCC licenses acquired in the KFMB-San Diego station acquisition in 2018 as well as those acquired in our 2019 acquisitions (Gray stations, Dispatch stations, and Nexstar stations), which represented an aggregate carrying value of $897.7 million. These licenses have more limited headroom due to the fact that we recently recorded them at fair value upon their respective acquisition, and as a result are more susceptible to the risk of impairment due to changes in underlying market factors.\nThe quantitative analysis performed included projected estimated economic impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. Changes in key fair value assumptions used in our analysis could result in future non-cash impairment charges, and any related impairment could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Changes in key fair value assumptions that could result in a future impairment charge include increases in discount rates and declines in market revenues. A 100 basis point increase in our discount rate or a 10% decline in market revenues (holding all other assumptions in the fair value model constant) would result in an aggregate impairment charge of approximately $17.0 million or less.\nPension Liabilities: Certain employees participate in qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans (see Note 6 to consolidated financial statements). Our principal defined benefit pension plan is the TEGNA Retirement Plan (TRP). We also sponsor the TEGNA Supplemental Retirement Plan (SERP) for certain employees. Substantially all participants in the TRP and SERP had their benefits frozen before 2009, and in December 2017, we froze all remaining accruing benefits for certain grandfathered SERP participants.\nWe recognize the net funded status of these postretirement benefit plans as a liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. There is a corresponding non-cash adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax benefits recorded as deferred tax assets, in stockholders' equity. The funded status represents the difference between the fair value of each plan's assets and the benefit obligation of the plan. The benefit obligation represents the present value of the estimated future benefits we currently expect to pay to plan participants based on past service.\nThe plan assets and benefit obligations are measured as of December 31 of each year, or more frequently, upon the occurrence of certain events such as a plan amendment, settlement, or curtailment. The amounts we record are measured using actuarial valuations, which are dependent upon key assumptions such as discount rates, participant mortality rates and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The assumptions we make affect both the calculation of the benefit obligations as of the measurement date and the calculation of net periodic pension expense in subsequent periods. When reassessing these assumptions we consider past and current market conditions and make judgments about future market trends. We also consider factors such as the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants.\nThe most important assumptions include the discount rate applied to pension plan obligations and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets related for the TRP (the SERP is an unfunded plan). The discount rate assumption is based on investment yields available at year-end on corporate bonds rated AA and above with a maturity to match the expected benefit payment stream. A decrease in discount rates would increase pension obligations.\nWe establish the expected long-term rate of return by developing a forward-looking, long-term return assumption for each pension fund asset class, taking into account factors such as the expected real return for the specific asset class and inflation. A single, long-term rate of return is then calculated as the weighted average of the target asset allocation percentages and the long-term return assumption for each asset class. We apply the expected long-term rate of return to the fair value of its pension assets in determining the dollar amount of its expected return. Changes in the expected long-term return on plan assets would increase or decrease pension plan expense. For 2021, we assumed a rate of 6.50% for our long-term expected return on pension assets used for our TRP plan. As an indication of the sensitivity of pension expense to the long-term rate of return assumption, a plus or minus 50 basis points change in the expected rate of return on pension assets (with all other assumptions held constant) would have decreased or increased estimated pension plan expense for 2021 by approximately $2.7 million. The effects of actual results differing from this assumption is accumulated as unamortized gains and losses.\nFor the December 31, 2021 measurement, the assumption used for the discount rate was 2.89% for our TRP and SERP plans. As an indication of the sensitivity of pension liabilities to the discount rate assumption, a plus or minus 50 basis points change in the discount rate as of the end of 2021 (with all other assumptions held constant) would have decreased or increased plan obligations by approximately $30.9 million. For 2021, the discount rate used to determine the pension expense was 2.54%. A 50 basis points increase or decrease in this discount rate would have decreased or increased total pension plan expense for 2021 by approximately $0.6 million.\nIncome Taxes: Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates, and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions.\nTax law requires certain items to be included in our tax returns at different times than when the items are reflected in the financial statements. The annual tax expense reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income is different than that reported in our tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent (for example, expenses recorded for accounting purposes that are not deductible in the returns such as certain entertainment expenses) and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements, as well as tax losses that can be carried over and used in future years. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amounts we believe are more likely than not to be recovered. In evaluating the amount of any such valuation allowance, we consider the existence of cumulative income or losses in recent years, the reversal of existing temporary differences, the existence of taxable income in prior carry back years, available tax planning strategies and estimates of future taxable income for each of our taxable jurisdictions. The latter two factors involve the exercise of significant judgment. As of December 31, 2021, deferred tax asset valuation allowances totaled $41.9 million, primarily related to federal and state capital losses, accrued compensation costs, minority investments, state interest disallowance carryovers, and state net operating losses available for carry forward to future years. Although realization is not assured, we believe it is more likely than not that all other deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowances have been established will be realized. This conclusion is based on our history of cumulative income in recent years and review of historical and projected future taxable income.\nWe determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities before any part of the benefit is recorded in our financial statements. A tax position is measured as the portion of the tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement with a taxing authority (that has full knowledge of all relevant information). We may be required to change our provision for income taxes when the ultimate treatment of certain items is challenged or agreed to by taxing authorities, when estimates used in determining valuation allowances on deferred tax assets significantly change, or when receipt of new information indicates the need for adjustment in valuation allowances. Future events, such as changes in tax laws, tax regulations, or interpretations of such laws or regulations, could have an impact on the provision for income tax and the effective tax rate. Any such changes could significantly affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements in the year these changes occur.", "item_7_tables": "Table 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,\" is a comprehensive analysis performed by management to discuss the financial and operational state of an innovative media company for the year under review.\n\nThe company's operations include a portfolio of 64 television stations, two radio stations, and various multicast networks in the U.S, with a digital presence in several online, mobile, and social platforms. It's dedicated to storytelling, impactful investigations, and innovative marketing services, and it's recognized with several industry awards. The company has one primary operating and reportable segment.\n\nKey revenue sources identified are subscription fees from satellite and cable providers, advertising and marketing services, political advertising revenues (which peak during election cycles), and other services like programming production and tower rentals.\n\nSignificant events affecting the company's financials included entering a Merger Agreement on February 22, 2022, expected to close in the second half of the same year, subject to various conditions. The company's financial results were also influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, which initially hurt advertising revenues. However, the company's advertising and marketing service (AMS) revenue significantly improved amidst economic reopening and government stimulus efforts.\n\nThe report details seasonality in revenue and operating results, generally higher in the second and fourth quarters. Political advertising also introduces significant fluctuations across even-numbered years. Additionally, the report includes a comparison of 2021 financials against both the previous year (2020) and two years prior (2019) to provide a context affected by political advertising cycles.\n\nThe company reported increased total revenues of 2% compared to 2020 and 30% compared to 2019, with primary growth drivers being an increase in subscription revenue and digital advertising services. They also faced decreased political advertising revenues versus the presidential election year of 2020 but showed an overall increase against 2019 figures.\n\nThe company's consolidated results show an operating income decrease of 8% compared to 2020 but a rise of 44% compared to 2019 figures. Similarly, net income slightly decreased by 1% against 2020 while showing a substantial increase of 67% compared to 2019. Earnings per share showed small decreases from 2020 but considerable increases from 2019 levels.\n\nThe discussion highlights multiple points, such as revenue source changes, impacts of the global pandemic, seasonality, acquisitions, costs of operations like programming, selling, and administrative expenses, along with various non-operating expenses and provisions for income taxes. It also considers the implications of special items such as M&A-related costs and advisory fees, among others.\n\nLastly, the report discusses the company's liquidity, capital resources, and the expected sufficiency of operational cash flow, borrowing capacity, and additional funding methods to cover debt service obligations, capital expenditures, and working capital requirements.\n\nPlease note, the amounts and specific data were not included in the summary, as the detailed tables with financial figures may have been truncated or omitted from the information provided."}
