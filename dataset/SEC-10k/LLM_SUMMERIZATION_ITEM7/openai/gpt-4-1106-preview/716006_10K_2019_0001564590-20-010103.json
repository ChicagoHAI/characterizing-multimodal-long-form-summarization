Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d MD&A\u201d, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. See the introductory section immediately prior to Part I\u201d and Risk Factors in Item 1A\u201d of this report regarding these statements.\nOverview\nThis MD&A includes the following sections:\nOur Business: a brief description of our business and a discussion of how we assess our operating results\nConsolidated Results of Operations: an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017\nReporting Segment Results of Operations: an analysis of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 for our two reporting segments: YRC Freight and Regional Transportation\nCertain Non-GAAP Financial Measures: an analysis of our results using certain non-GAAP financial measures, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017\nLiquidity and Capital Resources: a discussion of our major sources and uses of cash as well as an analysis of our cash flows and aggregate contractual obligations and commercial commitments\nOur Business\nYRC Worldwide is a holding company that, through its operating subsidiaries, offers our customers a wide range of transportation services. YRC Worldwide has one of the largest, most comprehensive LTL networks in North America with local, regional, national and international capabilities. Through its team of experienced service professionals, YRC Worldwide offers industry-leading expertise in LTL shipments and flexible supply chain solutions, ensuring customers can ship industrial, commercial and retail goods with confidence.\nWe measure the performance of our business on both a consolidated and reporting segment basis and using several metrics, but rely primarily upon (without limitation) operating revenue, operating income (loss), and operating ratio. We also use certain non-GAAP financial measures as secondary measures to assess our operating performance.\nTable 81: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Operating Revenue: Our operating revenue has two primary components: volume (commonly evaluated using tonnage, tonnage per day, number of shipments, shipments per day or weight per shipment) and yield or price (commonly evaluated using picked up revenue, revenue per hundredweight or revenue per shipment). Yield includes fuel surcharge revenue, which is common in the trucking industry and represents an amount charged to customers that adjusts with changing fuel prices. We base our fuel surcharges on the U.S. Department of Energy fuel index and adjust them weekly. Rapid material changes in the index or our cost of fuel can positively or negatively impact our revenue and operating income as a result of changes in our fuel surcharge. We believe that fuel surcharge is an accepted and important component of the overall pricing of our services to our customers. Without an industry accepted fuel surcharge program, our base pricing for our transportation services would require changes. We believe the distinction between base rates and fuel surcharge has blurred over time, and it is impractical to clearly separate all the different factors that influence the price that our customers are willing to pay. In general, under our present fuel surcharge program, we believe rising fuel costs are beneficial to us and falling fuel costs are detrimental to us in the short term, the effects of which are mitigated over time.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Operating Income (Loss): Operating income (loss) is operating revenue less operating expenses. Consolidated operating income (loss) includes certain corporate charges that are not allocated to our reporting segments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Operating Ratio: Operating ratio is a common operating performance measure used in the trucking industry. It is calculated as (i) 100 percent (ii) minus the result of dividing operating income by operating revenue or (iii) plus the result of dividing operating loss by operating revenue, and is expressed as a percentage.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Non-GAAP Financial Measures: We use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures, to assess the following:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25e6\n</td> <td> EBITDA: a non-GAAP measure that reflects our earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization expense. EBITDA is used for internal management purposes as a financial measure that reflects our core operating performance.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25e6\n</td> <td> Adjusted EBITDA: a non-GAAP measure that reflects EBITDA, and further adjusts for letter of credit fees, equity-based compensation expense, net gains or losses on property disposals, restructuring charges, transaction costs related to issuances of debt, non-recurring consulting fees, non-cash impairment charges and the gains or losses from permitted dispositions, discontinued operations, and certain non-cash expenses, charges and losses (provided that if any of such non-cash expenses, charges or losses represents an accrual or reserve for potential cash items in any future period, the cash payment in respect thereof in such future period will be subtracted from Consolidated EBITDA in such future period to the extent paid). All references to Adjusted EBITDA\u201d throughout this section and the rest of this report refer to Adjusted EBITDA\u201d calculated under our New Term Loan Agreement (defined therein as Consolidated EBITDA\u201d unless otherwise specified). Consolidated EBITDA is also a defined term in our ABL Agreement and the definition there aligns with the prior definition of Consolidated EBITDA under the Prior Term Loan Agreement. Adjusted EBITDA is used for internal management purposes as a financial measure that reflects our core operating performance, to measure compliance with financial covenants in our credit facilities and to determine certain management and employee bonus compensation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe our presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors and other users as these measures represent key supplemental information our management uses to compare and evaluate our core underlying business results both on a consolidated basis and across our business segments, particularly in light of our leverage position and the capital-intensive nature of our business. Further, EBITDA is a measure that is commonly used by other companies in our industry and provides a comparison for investors to evaluate the performance of the companies in the industry. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA helps investors to understand how the company is tracking against our financial covenant in our term loan credit agreement as this measure is calculated as defined in our term loan credit agreement and serves as a driving component of our key financial covenant.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures have the following limitations:\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25e6\n</td> <td> EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or fund principal payments on our outstanding debt;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25e6\n</td> <td> Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or fund principal payments on our outstanding debt, letter of credit fees, restructuring charges, transaction costs related to the issuance of debt, non-cash expenses, charges or losses (subject to the conditions above), or nonrecurring consulting fees, among other items;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25e6\n</td> <td> Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will generally need to be replaced in the future and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25e6\n</td> <td> Equity-based compensation is an element of our long-term incentive compensation package, although Adjusted EBITDA excludes employee equity-based compensation expense when presenting our ongoing operating performance for a particular period; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 91: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25e6\n</td> <td> Other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, potentially limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBecause of these limitations, our non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and use our non-GAAP measures as secondary measures.\nNew National Master Freight Agreement\nOn May 14, 2019, union employees at operating companies Holland, New Penn and YRC Freight ratified New NMFA, along with all supplemental agreements. The New NMFA outlines terms and conditions of employment that are customary in collective bargaining agreements and apply at a national level across the covered operations, such as wages, health benefits, multiemployer pension plan contribution rates, and various operational items. A few of the highlights in the New NMFA include:\nTable 92: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Hourly wage increases in each year of the contract, beginning April 1, 2019 through 2023\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Health and welfare and pension contribution rate increases\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Restoration of an additional one-week of vacation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The expanded ability to utilize smaller trucks that can be operated by employees who do not have a CDL\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The ability to utilize additional hours of service, in accordance with Department of Transportation regulations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The increased ability to utilize purchased transportation at YRC Freight and Holland\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The increased ability to utilize employees in non-driving positions\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> A newly-structured performance bonus program for employees\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe new wage improvements allow us to advance our driver hiring and retention efforts to ensure we are adequately staffed with professional CDL drivers and other key personnel at our service centers. The contractual wage increases under the New NMFA that were paid retroactively to April 1, 2019 include one additional week of vacation that was retroactively applied to 2018. Additionally, the Company incurred one-time vacation charges in second quarter operating results of $12.4 million to reflect the full year 2018 and first quarter 2019 vacation benefit increase.\nThe supplemental agreements cover more localized work rules and other terms and conditions of employment. The Company was unable to commence actions to implement the operational efficiencies until the New NMFA, and all supplements, were fully ratified on May 14, 2019.\nBusiness Strategy Overview\nDuring 2019, the Company launched a multi-year enterprise transformation strategy to achieve long-term profitability and cash flow. Our strategic roadmap is built upon the proven alliance of our LTL regional and national networks, as well as our recently launched multi-mode freight brokerage solutions, to provide a broad portfolio of freight and business services to our customers.\nThe Company accomplished four foundational components during 2019:\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.\n</td> <td> Ratified a new five-year labor contract\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 101: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.\n</td> <td> Refinanced a term loan with improved and more flexible terms\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.\n</td> <td> Reorganized the field leadership structure to streamline decision making and enhance execution\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.\n</td> <td> Completed the reorganization of the enterprise-wide sales force\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLabor contract: During the first half of 2019, the Company ratified the New NMFA for the employees of Holland, New Penn and YRC Freight. The New NMFA is a critical element to the comprehensive strategic plan as it provides the Company with important changes to create a foundation for operational excellence and capacity expansion, which should lead to improved profitability. The operational changes are expected to provide efficiencies in our workforce by introducing new job classifications and allowing us to employ more flexible work rules to optimize the use of our valuable employee resources. These changes allow us to improve labor mix which should result in reduced costs per labor hour. For example, prior to the New NMFA, we were unable to fill part-time positions in many key markets across our footprint due to a non-competitive wage package for part-time employees. With the New NMFA, we have the opportunity to expand our part-time work force which allows us to reposition our commercial driver's license ( CDL\u201d) drivers to freight delivery and to deploy part-time employees to dock positions, resulting in lower employee compensation expense and improved productivity. The expansion of purchased transportation that is permitted under the New NMFA (increased to 29% of total linehaul miles for YRC Freight and introduced an 8% limit for Holland) provides us opportunities to plan and source our operations using more cost-effective resources and to expand our capacity consistent with our customer growth and engagement initiatives. The New NMFA also allows us to introduce new equipment, referred to as box trucks, into our LTL freight operations, which, along with new non-CDL driver classifications, permits us to provide a lower cost solution to local cartage or short-term rentals. Further, on September 27, 2019, the Company ratified a new two-year collective bargaining agreement for the employees of Reddaway, who were previously party to multiple bargaining agreements, and have now been combined into one collective agreement.\nCapital Structure Update: The Company announced a refinancing of its term loan obligations on September 11, 2019 and entered into a New Term Loan Agreement, which provides for additional liquidity, less restrictive financial covenants, a lower interest rate and extends the maturity of the facility to June 2024. The New Term Loan eliminates the annual principal amortization of 3.0%, which approximated $18.0 million in principal payments per year, and provides the ability to reinvest the first $40.0 million in cash proceeds earned from the sale of certain owned properties.\nEnhanced Organization Structure: Creating simplified engagement for customers and an improved service offering is a critical part of our strategic focus on growth and engagement. We completed the final phase of our sales restructuring which consolidated our four distinct sales groups into one enterprise-wide sales organization. This allows customers to buy regional, national and brokerage services from a single point of contact at YRCW while introducing existing customers to all our operating companies. The launch of our third-party brokerage solution, HNRY Logistics in late 2018, is the perfect complement to our LTL, asset-based companies and allows us to better service our customers with a full suite of logistics solutions. In addition, we implemented a new field operations structure to align with our enterprise transformation strategy to streamline decision making and enhance execution of our network enhancements\nGoing into 2020, the next phase of our transformation includes:\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.\n</td> <td> Operational optimization\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.\n</td> <td> Technology migration\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.\n</td> <td> Facility evaluation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe primary focus for the next phase of the enterprise transformation strategy is to operationally transform the movement of freight through our network and the technology used in the process. In the initial phase of our plan to optimize operations, which spanned most of 2019, two of our companies operate independently out of the same service center. Under the New NMFA that was ratified on May 14, 2019, we have the opportunity to consolidate service centers across our operating companies to optimize utilization of our assets and resources, and companies that operate in the same service territory will be serviced through one primary carrier. We believe service center consolidation presents the greatest opportunity for this initiative. We launched our first consolidation in late 2019, with the emphasis of facility evaluation occurring in 2020. By rationalizing the number of physical locations in the network while maintaining geographic coverage, we will continue to provide the same service level to our valued customers. We expect these efforts should allow us to recognize cost savings in our linehaul and pick-up and delivery operations due to improved density, increased asset utilization, and optimization of route planning and labor resources. Over time, this initiative should enhance service and strategically position our network for the growing demand of our customers and their supply chain needs, provide productivity improvements and streamline our cost structure as we seek to optimize resources across the network, in facilities, infrastructure and human capital.\nCapital investment remains a top priority for us. While ongoing investments in equipment and technology remain our primary use of operating cash flows, we understand the importance of balancing liquidity and our ongoing investments with the service and capacity we need to bring to the market. To properly execute on our transformation plan, we are committed to investing in technology in order to enhance the customer experience and improve our operational flexibilities. We intend to consolidate individual operating company systems into a single platform, with the end goal of improving profitability and the customer experience. By streamlining systems, we are providing our customers access to five brands through one network and one enterprise-wide service offering. We remain committed to investment in revenue equipment to improve the age of our fleet as there is an immediate return in improved fuel miles per gallon and reduced vehicle maintenance expense.\nSegments\nEffective January 1, 2020, the Company will realign its reportable segments as a result of an enhanced organizational structure implemented in the back half of 2019 designed to better align resources and provide greater focus on the Company's multi-year enterprise transformation strategy. The strategy is designed to improve the long-term profitability and stability of the Company, with key focus on enhancing competitive value proposition. Key elements of the enterprise transformation include operational optimization to bolster asset utilization and to leverage flexibilities gained from the new labor contract; facility evaluation to build density and create cost savings by consolidating service centers while fully protecting all brands and areas of service; and customer growth/engagement initiatives to enhance customer experience and improve our value proposition by supplying all of our service offerings and brands as one. We realigned sales to consolidate our four distinct sales groups into one enterprise sales organization. This allows customers to buy regional, national and brokerage services from a single point of contact at YRCW while introducing existing customers to additional operating companies.\nWe also implemented a new field structure to align with our enterprise transformation strategy to streamline decision making and enhance execution of our network enhancements. With the ratification of the New NMFA on May 14, 2019, the Company may now combine service centers across our operating companies to optimize utilization of our assets and resources, and the companies that operate in the same service territory will be serviced through one primary carrier.\nThe presentation of financial results as one reportable segment is consistent with the way the Company has transformed its operational leadership team under the Chief Operating Decision Maker ( CODM\u201d) where he formerly had the operating company presidents as direct reports and now has direct reports who are functional leaders whose roles span across the entire\nenterprise. Starting in 2020, the CODM will be evaluating our performance and business results, as well as making resource and operating decisions under the single segment view.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nOur consolidated results for 2019, 2018 and 2017 include the consolidated results of our reporting segments and unallocated corporate charges. A more detailed discussion of the operating results of our reporting segments is presented in the Reporting Segment Results of Operations\u201d section below.\nThe table below provides summary consolidated financial information for the three years ended December 31:\nTable 107: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2019 vs. 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2018 vs. 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,871.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,092.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,891.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.3\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 142.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 119.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (88.7\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Nonoperating expenses, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 124.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 111.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 137.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18.6\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (104.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/M*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 287.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(*) not meaningful\n2019 Compared to 2018\nOur consolidated operating revenue decreased $220.8 million, or 4.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018. The decrease in revenue is primarily attributed to a decrease in tonnage and fuel surcharge revenue, while partially offset by an increase in base yield excluding fuel surcharge.\nOperating expenses decreased $94.1 million, or 1.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to lower purchased transportation expense and lower fuel, operating expenses and supplies, partially offset by increased salaries, wages and employee benefits.\nSalaries, wages and employee benefits. Salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $13.7 million, or 0.5%, primarily due to a $35.5 million increase in benefits costs which was largely driven by a $25.8 increase in union vacation expense due to restoration of benefits from the passage of the New NMFA, a $15.7 million increase in workers' compensation expense, and a $6.8 million increase in salaries expense. These increases were partially offset by a $32.9 million reduction in short-term incentive compensation and an $11.3 million decrease in wages expense as a result of tonnage decreases that reduced the number of hours needed to process freight which were partially offset by contractual rate increases due to the New NMFA.\nFuel, operating expenses and supplies. Fuel, operating expenses and supplies decreased $51.2 million, or 5.4%, primarily due to a $48.1 million decrease in fuel expense, which was largely a result of lower fuel prices and fewer miles driven.\nPurchased transportation. Purchased transportation decreased $69.0 million, or 10.1%, primarily due to a $68.3 million decrease in rail and over-the-road purchased transportation expense as a result of reduced tonnage, a $9.3 million decrease from reduced usage of local purchased transportation, and a $5.9 million decrease in short-term vehicle rents. These decreases were partially offset by an $18.5 million increase in third-party costs due to the expansion in third-party logistics solutions.\nOther operating expenses. Other operating expenses decreased $7.6 million, or 3.1%, primarily due to a decrease of $4.2 million in cargo claims expense, and a $4.0 million reduction in operating taxes as a result of fewer miles driven.\nGains/losses on property disposals. Net gains on disposals of property were $13.7 million during 2019 as compared to $20.8 million in 2018. The gains in 2019 and 2018 were primarily related to the sale of real properties, including a $29.3 million gain from the sale of one excess property at YRC Freight during 2018.\nNonoperating expenses, net. Nonoperating expenses increased $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to an $11.2 million expense in 2019 related to the extinguishment of debt with no such charge in 2018, a $5.4 million increase in interest expense due to higher interest rates and outstanding debt balances during 2019, which were partially offset by a $6.3 million decrease in non-union pension costs due mainly to a reduction in non-cash pension settlement expenses.\nImpairment charges. During the first quarter of 2019, the company recorded an $8.2 million impairment charge that reflects the write-down of an intangible asset as a result of rebranding strategies, leading to the discontinued use of a tradename.\nOur effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was 4.0% and 35.5%, respectively. Significant items impacting the 2019 rate include a provision for net state and foreign taxes, certain permanent items, and a change in the valuation allowance established for the net deferred tax asset balance at December 31, 2019. We recognize valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, if, based on the weight of the evidence, we believe that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances are included in our tax provision or in equity if directly related to other comprehensive income (loss) in the period of change. In determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, we evaluate factors such as prior years' earnings history, expected future earnings, loss carry-back and carry-forward periods, reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies that potentially enhance the likelihood of the realization of a deferred tax asset. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we have a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets, exclusive of a deferred tax (asset) liability related to a foreign jurisdiction.\nIn July 2011, July 2013, and January 2014, we experienced significant changes in the ownership of our stock, as measured for Federal income tax purposes. These changes triggered the application of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the Code\u201d), which will likely have no substantial impact on the use of tax net operating loss carryovers ( NOLs\u201d) generated through January 31, 2014 and prior to offset future taxable income. While Section 382 changes may adversely affect cash flow, they have no impact on our current financial statements. The deferred tax assets resulting from the existing NOLs to which a Section 382 change applies are already fully offset by a valuation allowance.\n2018 Compared to 2017\nOur consolidated operating revenue increased $201.0 million, or 4.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The increase in revenue was largely attributed to increased base yield excluding fuel surcharge and fuel surcharge revenue, while partially offset by a decrease in tonnage.\nOperating expenses increased $177.1 million, or 3.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, due to an increase in salaries, wages and employee benefits, an increase in purchased transportation expense, and higher fuel costs, which were partially offset by an increase in gains on property disposals.\nSalaries, wages and employee benefits. Salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $65.8 million, or 2.3%, primarily due to a $49.2 million increase in employee benefit costs, which are primarily related to contractual rate increases for union employees, and a $29.8 million increase in short-term incentive compensation for employees at various levels in the organization. These increases were partially offset by a $10.9 million decrease in wages due to a decrease in shipping volumes, which required fewer employee hours to process freight.\nFuel, operating expenses and supplies. Fuel, operating expenses and supplies increased $72.7 million, or 8.4%, primarily due to a $52.7 million increase in fuel expenses driven by higher fuel prices on a per gallon basis, partially offset by fewer miles driven and improved miles per gallon. The increase in operating expenses was also due to an increase of $6.9 million in facility related expense primarily due to increased rent expense at our leased terminal locations.\nPurchased transportation. Purchased transportation increased $55.7 million, or 8.9%, primarily due to a $35.8 million increase in vehicle rent expense, mostly related to a $32.9 million increase in long-term rental expense in conjunction with the Company's leasing strategy to invest in revenue equipment. Purchased transportation expense also includes a $29.6 million increase in third-party costs due to the expansion in customer-specific logistics solutions. These increases were partially offset by a $12.2 million decrease in local purchased transportation due to reduced usage.\nOther operating expenses. Other operating expenses increased $3.1 million, or 1.3%, primarily due to an increase of $8.1 million in our third-party liability claims expense primarily due to current year claims, partially offset by a $4.6 million decrease in cargo claims expense.\nGains/losses on property disposals. Net gains on disposals of property were $20.8 million in 2018 compared to net gains of $0.6 million in 2017. The gains in 2018 were primarily related to the sale of real properties, including a $29.3 million gain from the sale of an excess property at YRC Freight.\nNonoperating expenses, net. Nonoperating expenses decreased $25.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to an $11.2 million decrease in net periodic pension cost. Additionally, in 2017 we incurred $8.1 million in transaction costs related to debt amendments with no corresponding expense in 2018.\nOur effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was 35.5% and 40.3%, respectively. Significant items impacting the 2018 rate include a provision for net state and foreign taxes, foreign withholding taxes related to dividends from a foreign subsidiary, certain permanent items, and a change in the valuation allowance established for the net deferred tax asset balance at December 31, 2018. Significant items impacting the 2017 rate include a benefit recognized due to application of the exception to the rules regarding intraperiod tax allocation, a provision for net state and foreign taxes, certain permanent items,\nand a change in the valuation allowance established for the net deferred tax asset balance at December 31, 2017. We recognize valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, if, based on the weight of the evidence, we believe that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances are included in our tax provision or in equity if directly related to other comprehensive income (loss) in the period of change. In determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, we evaluate factors such as prior years' earnings history, expected future earnings, loss carry-back and carry-forward periods, reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies that potentially enhance the likelihood of the realization of a deferred tax asset. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we have a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets, exclusive of a deferred tax liability related to a foreign jurisdiction.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) was enacted in the U.S. on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act reduced the US federal corporate income tax rate to 21% from 35%, required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and created new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings. The Company adopted the guidance provided by Securities and Exchange Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d) regarding the public disclosures of certain accounting impacts of the Tax Act. In 2017 and the first nine months of 2018, the Company recorded provisional amounts for certain enactment date effects by applying the guidance in SAB 118 because we had not yet completed our enactment date accounting for these effects. All provisional amounts were finalized for the 2018 Form 10-K as required by SAB 118. This includes the federal and state income tax effects of newly enacted one-time transition tax. Such finalization had no net impact on the tax provision for 2018, as it merely adjusted net operating loss carry-forward amounts and was fully offset by a valuation allowance.\nReporting Segment Results of Operations\nWe evaluate our business using our two reporting segments:\nTable 108: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> YRC Freight is the reporting segment that focuses on longer haul business opportunities with national, regional and international services.

of $46.7 million from the same period in 2018. Operating expenses decreased $61.9 million primarily due to decreases in purchased transportation expense and fuel, operating expenses and supplies. These decreases were partially offset by increased salaries, wages and employee benefits.\nSalaries, wages and employee benefits. Salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $7.2 million, or 0.4%, primarily due to a $21.9 million increase in benefits costs which was largely driven by a $16.8 million increase in union vacation expense due to restoration of benefits from the passage of the New NMFA, and a $2.9 million increase in salaries expense. These increases were partially offset by a $9.0 million decrease in wage expense as a result of a decrease in tonnage that reduced the number of hours needed to process freight, which was partially offset by contractual rate increases as a result of the New NMFA, as well as an $8.2 million reduction in short-term incentive compensation.\nFuel, operating expenses and supplies. Fuel, operating expenses and supplies decreased $42.9 million, or 7.2%, primarily due to a $28.7 million decrease in fuel expenses driven by lower fuel prices on a per gallon basis, fewer miles driven and improved miles per gallon. Also, professional fees decreased by $9.2 million primarily due to decreased management fees of corporate and other enterprise-wide shared services and other corporate service fees and consulting fees.\nPurchased Transportation. Purchased transportation decreased $49.7 million, or 9.3%, primarily due to a $49.8 million decrease in rail and over-the-road purchased transportation expense as a result of reduced shipping volumes, an $11.1 million\ndecrease from reduced usage of local purchased transportation, and a $5.5 million decrease in short-term vehicle rents. These decreases were partially offset by an $18.5 million increase in third-party costs due to the expansion in customer-specific logistics solutions.\nGains/losses on property disposals. Net gains on disposals of property were $9.8 million during 2019 as compared to $20.2 million in 2018. The gains in 2019 and 2018 were primarily related to the sale of real properties, including a $29.3 million gain from the sale of one excess property during 2018.\nImpairment charges. During the first quarter of 2019, the company recorded an $8.2 million impairment charge that reflects the write-down of an intangible asset as a result of rebranding strategies, leading to the discontinued use of a tradename.\n2018 Compared to 2017\nYRC Freight reported operating revenue of $3,197.3 million in 2018, an increase of $129.4 million, or 4.2%, compared to 2017. The increase in revenue was largely driven by an increase in base yield excluding fuel surcharge and fuel surcharge revenue, partially offset by a decrease in tonnage.

increase of $24.3 million from the same period in 2017. Operating expenses increased $105.1 million primarily due to an increase in salaries, wages and employee benefits, an increase in purchased transportation expense, and higher fuel costs, which were partially offset by an increase in gains on property disposals.\nSalaries, wages and employee benefits. Salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $21.3 million, or 1.2%, primarily due to a $33.0 million increase in employee benefit costs, which are primarily related to contractual rate increases for union employees, and a $6.1 million increase in short-term incentive compensation for employees at various levels in the organization. These increases were partially offset by an $11.7 million decrease in wages due to a decrease in shipping volumes, which required fewer employee hours to process freight. Additionally, workers' compensation expense decreased $6.1 million mainly due to favorable development on prior year claims.\nFuel, operating expenses and supplies. Fuel, operating expenses and supplies increased $51.7 million, or 9.5%, primarily due to a $26.2 million increase in fuel expenses driven by higher fuel prices on a per gallon basis, partially offset by fewer miles driven and improved miles per gallon. Also, professional fees increased by $21.0 million primarily due to increased management fees and other corporate service fees and non-recurring consulting fees.\nPurchased Transportation. Purchased transportation increased $55.0 million, or 11.5%, primarily due to a $33.5 million increase in vehicle rent expense of which $30.6 million was attributable to long-term rentals in conjunction with the Company's leasing strategy to invest in revenue equipment. Purchased transportation expense also includes a $29.6 million increase in third-party costs due to the expansion in customer-specific logistics solutions. These costs were partially offset by an $11.3 million decrease from reduced usage of local purchased transportation.\nOther operating expenses. Other operating expenses decreased $2.1 million, or 1.4%, primarily due to a $6.1 million decrease in cargo claims expense, partially offset by an increase of $4.1 million in our third-party liability claims expense primarily due to current year claims.\nGains/losses on property disposals. Net gains on disposals of property were $20.2 million in 2018 compared to net gains of $2.2 million in 2017, primarily due to the sale of real properties. The 2018 gain includes a $29.3 million gain on the sale of an excess property.\nRegional Transportation Results\nRegional Transportation represented 37% of consolidated operating revenue in 2019, 2018 and 2017.

$75.5 million from operating income of $70.7 million for the same period in 2018. Operating expenses decreased $36.8 million primarily due to a decrease in purchased transportation expense and fuel, operating expenses and supplies. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in salaries, wages and employee benefits.\nSalaries, wages and employee benefits. Salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $17.9 million, or 1.6%, primarily due to a $15.5 million increase in workers' compensation expense and a $13.8 million increase in employee benefits costs which was largely driven by an $9.0 million increase in union vacation expense due to restoration of benefits from the passage of the New NMFA. These increases were partially offset by an $8.3 million reduction in short-term incentive compensation and a $2.5 million decrease in wage expense as a result of a decrease in tonnage that reduced the number of hours needed to process freight, which was partially offset by contractual rate increases as a result of the New NMFA.\nFuel, operating expenses and supplies. Fuel, operating expenses and supplies decreased $22.6 million, or 5.7%, primarily due to a $19.4 million decrease in fuel expense, which was largely driven by fewer miles driven and lower prices.\nOther operating expenses. Other operating expenses decreased $7.6 million, or 7.7%, primarily due to a decrease of $6.9 million in our third-party liability claims expense primarily due to the favorable development of prior-year claims.\nGains/losses on property disposals. Net gains on disposals of property were $5.3 million during 2019 as compared to $0.6 million in 2018. The gains in 2019 and 2018 were primarily related to the sale of real properties.\n2018 Compared to 2017\nRegional Transportation reported operating revenue of $1,895.0 million for 2018, representing an increase of $71.6 million, or 3.9%, from 2017. The increase in revenue was largely driven by an increase in base yield excluding fuel surcharge and fuel surcharge revenue, partially offset by a decrease in tonnage.

of $2.8 million from the same period in 2017. Operating expenses increased $68.8 million primarily due to higher fuel costs, an increase in contractual wages and employee benefit costs, and an increase in vehicle maintenance expense.\nSalaries, wages and employee benefits. Salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $20.0 million, or 1.8%, primarily due to a $14.3 million increase in employee benefit costs, which are primarily related to contractual rate increases for union employees, and a $6.6 million increase in short-term incentive compensation for employees at various levels in the organization. These increases were partially offset by a $4.1 million decrease in workers' compensation expense mainly due to favorable development on prior year claims.\nFuel, operating expenses and supplies. Fuel, operating expenses and supplies increased $43.1 million, or 12.2%, primarily due to a $26.5 million increase in fuel expenses driven by higher fuel prices on a per gallon basis, partially offset by fewer miles driven. Additionally, vehicle maintenance expense increased $8.2 million primarily due to the timing of revenue equipment additions, and professional fees increased $3.8 million due to increased management and other corporate service fees.\nOther operating expenses. Other operating expenses increased $5.1 million, or 5.4%, primarily due to an increase of $3.9 million increase in our third-party liability claims expense primarily due to current year claims and a $1.5 million increase in cargo claims expense.\nCertain Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAs discussed in the Our Business\u201d section, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures to assess performance.

As of December 31, 2019, our maximum availability under our ABL Facility was $37.7 million, and our managed accessibility is $0.2 million. Maximum availability is derived by reducing the amount that may be advanced against eligible receivables plus eligible borrowing base cash by certain reserves imposed by the ABL Agent and our $337.8 million of outstanding letters of credit. Our Managed Accessibility of $0.2 million represents the maximum amount we would access on the ABL Facility and is adjusted for eligible receivables plus eligible borrowing base cash measured as of December 31, 2019. If eligible receivables fall below the threshold management uses to measure availability, which is 10% of the borrowing line, the credit agreement governing the ABL Facility permits adjustments from eligible borrowing base cash to restricted cash prior to the compliance measurement date of January 15, 2020. As of January 15, 2020, we had less than 10% of the borrowing line in eligible receivables and moved $29.0 million of cash into restricted cash, as permitted under the ABL Facility, which effectively put our cash and cash equivalents and Managed Accessibility to $80.4 million as of December 31, 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our availability under our ABL Facility was $39.2 million. Of the $39.2 million in availability, Managed Accessibility was $1.2 million. Our cash and cash equivalents and Managed Accessibility was $203.8 million as of December 31, 2018.\nThe table below summarizes cash and cash equivalents and Managed Accessibility for the years ended December 31:\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 109.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 227.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: amounts placed into restricted cash subsequent to year-end\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (29.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (25.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Managed Accessibility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cash and cash equivalents and Managed Accessibility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 80.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 203.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOutside of funding normal operations, our principal uses of cash include making contributions to our various multi-employer pension funds and single-employer pension plans, and meeting our other cash obligations, including, but not limited to, paying principal and interest on our funded debt, payments on equipment leases and investments in capital expenditures.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our Standard & Poor's Corporate Family Rating was B-\u201d with a stable outlook and Moody's Investor Service Corporate Family Rating was B2\u201d with a positive outlook.\nCredit Facility Covenants\nThe New Term Loan Agreement includes a financial covenant requirement for the Company to maintain a minimum of $200.0 million trailing-twelve-month Adjusted EBITDA, measured quarterly. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, defined in our New Term Loan Agreement as Consolidated EBITDA,\u201d is a measure that reflects our earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization expense, and is further adjusted for, among other things, letter of credit fees, equity-based compensation expense, net gains or losses on property disposals, restructuring charges, transaction costs related to issuances of debt, non-recurring consulting fees, non-cash impairment charges, integration costs, severance, non-recurring charges and the gains or losses from permitted dispositions, discontinued operations, and certain non-cash expenses, charges and losses (provided that if any of such non-cash expenses, charges or losses represents an accrual or reserve for potential cash items in any future period, the cash payment in respect thereof in such future period will be subtracted from Consolidated EBITDA in such future period to the extent paid). The definition was further modified under the New Term Loan Agreement such that certain expenses that qualify as adjustments are capped at 10.0% of the trailing-twelve-month Adjusted EBITDA. Adjustments subject to the 10.0% cap include, but are not limited to, restructuring charges, integration costs, severance, and non-recurring charges. Additionally, all net gains from the disposition of properties are excluded from the definition of Adjusted EBITDA, therefore any gains previously recognized in Adjusted EBITDA, as that term was previously defined in our SEC filings prior to our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2019, in accordance with its definition in the Prior Term Loan Agreement, will not be included in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA under the New Term Loan Agreement. Further, for all years presented in this Annual Form 10-K, the presentation of adjusted EBITDA has been updated to reflect this new definition. Our trailing twelve month Adjusted EBITDA as of December 31, 2019 was $210.6 million.\nThe ABL Facility also contains certain affirmative and negative covenants with which we must comply.\nRisks and Uncertainties Regarding Compliance with Credit Facility Financial Covenants\nUnder the New Term Loan, we are required to maintain at least $200.0 million in Adjusted EBITDA on a TTM basis measured each quarter until maturity (June 2024). For the TTM period ended December 31, 2019, we achieved Adjusted EBITDA of $210.6 million. We believe that our results of operations will allow us to comply with the minimum Adjusted EBITDA covenant for at least the next twelve months. Our ability to comply is subject to a more stable and robust freight environment and continued actions and cost savings initiatives we began in the fourth quarter of 2019 and continue today. These actions and initiatives include headcount reductions commensurate with our current volume levels, a hiring freeze on new and replacement positions, temporary elimination of short-term incentive compensation, and a reduction in discretionary spend.\nWe began taking these actions because of the freight recession our industry experienced in 2019, and that has persisted into early first quarter 2020, that negatively impacted our ability to fully realize operational efficiencies arising from our New NMFA with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters primarily due to the ensuing depressed volume levels and the inherent contractual cost increase associated with the New NMFA. Our ability to satisfy our liquidity needs and meet our minimum Adjusted EBITDA requirement during the next twelve months and thereafter is dependent upon our ability to improve operating performance over 2019 to offset the contractual wage and benefit increases under the New NMFA and other inflationary expense increases associated with among other things our employees and insurance programs.\nWe may extend and or supplement the actions we began taking in 2019 if we continue to experience adverse conditions such as lower volumes, pricing, yield or lower productivities among others, that might impact our forecasted performance. If we are unable to achieve the results required to comply with this covenant in one or more quarters over the next twelve months, we may be required to take specific actions in addition to those described above, including but not limited to, additional reductions in headcount and targeted procurement initiatives to reduce operating costs and, or alternatively, seek a waiver or an amendment from our lenders. Obtaining a waiver or an amendment is not within our control, and if unsuccessful, the lenders may exercise the rights available to them under the New Term Loan.\nCash Flow\nOperating Cash Flow\nCash flow from operations decreased by $203.3 million to $21.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $224.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in cash flow is primarily related to a $124.2 million decrease in net income, and the remaining difference is primarily related to timing differences in working capital accounts.\nCash flow from operations increased by $164.1 million to $224.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $60.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in cash flow is primarily related to $55.2 million in changes to accounts receivables from an improvement in days sales outstanding, and a $52.8 million decrease in minimum cash contributions for the non-union pension plans. Cash provided by operations also improved due to a $31.0 million increase in net income.\nInvesting Cash Flow\nCash used in investing activities was $117.3 million in 2019 compared to $109.0 million in 2018, primarily due to a net decrease in proceeds from the disposal of property and equipment of $10.5 million.\nCash used in investing activities was $109.0 million in 2018 compared to $94.5 million in 2017, primarily due to an increase in acquisition costs for revenue equipment. Partially offsetting this increase, net proceeds from the disposal of property and equipment increased $27.6 million mainly due to the sale of real properties.\nSee a detailed discussion of 2019 and 2018 capital expenditures below in Capital Expenditures\u201d for further information.\nFinancing Cash Flow\nNet cash used in financing activities for 2019 was $22.6 million, which consists primarily of $579.0 million in repayments of our long-term debt, offset by the issuance of $570.0 million of long-term debt for the New Term Loan, in addition to $12.7 million in deferred debt issuance costs incurred.\nNet cash used in financing activities for 2018 was $33.9 million, which consists primarily of $31.9 million in repayments of our long-term debt.\nNet cash used in financing activities for 2017 was $96.2 million, which consists primarily of $79.3 million in repayments of our long-term debt, of which $61.9 million was in addition to regularly scheduled principal payments, as well as $14.5 million in debt issuance costs incurred during the year related to our financing transactions.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur capital expenditures focus primarily on the replacement of revenue equipment, investments in information technology and improvements to land and structures. Our business is capital intensive with significant investments in tractors, trailers, refurbished engines, and service center facilities. We determine the amount and timing of capital expenditures based on numerous factors, including fleet age, service center condition, viability of IT systems, anticipated liquidity levels, economic conditions, new or expanded services, regulatory actions and availability of financing.\nThe table below summarizes our actual net capital expenditures (proceeds) by type of investment for the years ended December 31:\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition of property and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 88.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 79.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 35.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Land and structures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Technology\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 143.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 145.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 103.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Proceeds from disposal of property and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Land and structures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (22.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (32.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Technology\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total proceeds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (25.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (36.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total net capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 117.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 109.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 94.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur capital expenditures for revenue equipment were used primarily to fund the purchase of tractors, trailers and containers and to refurbish engines for our revenue fleet.\nWe also acquire our equipment through operating leases which will vary based on anticipated liquidity and lease financing options.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we entered into new operating lease commitments for revenue equipment totaling $111.0 million, with such payments to be made over an average lease term of 4 years with a capital equivalent value of $131.8 million. As of December 31, 2019, our operating lease obligations through 2030 totaled 451.1 million and are expected to increase as we lease additional revenue equipment in future years.\nContractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments\nThe following sections provide aggregated information regarding our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2019.\nNon-Union Pension Obligations\nWe provide defined benefit pension plans for certain employees not covered by collective bargaining agreements. The qualified plans, which include the Yellow Corporation Pension Plan, the Roadway LLC Pension Plan and the YRC Retirement Pension Plan (collectively held in the YRC Worldwide Inc. Master Pension Plans Trust or Trust\u201d) cover approximately 9,000 employees including those currently receiving benefits and those who have left the company with deferred benefits. On January 1, 2004, the existing qualified benefit plans were closed to new participants. On July 1, 2008, the benefit accrual for participants was frozen.\nIn 2015, we adopted the legislative changes provided by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 ( BBA 2015\u201d) which was signed into law on November 2, 2015. This legislation extends the use of longer-term, stabilized interest rate assumptions for measuring pension obligations under the minimum funding requirements. We expect to make the plan contributions as required by BBA 2015 and other regulations.\nDuring 2017, the Company amended the domestic qualified pension plans to provide for an automatic commencement of benefit at age 65, regardless of employment status. Also during 2017, the Yellow Transportation Plan was amended to permit the payment of lump sum benefit payments for those participants who reached age 65. Additionally, the Yellow Transportation Plan was amended to permit the payment of lump sum benefit payments effective January 1, 2018. These amendments are consistent with the Company's continued long-term strategy of de-risking the qualified pension plans.\nDuring 2019, our net pension expense was $2.6 million. This amount included a $1.8 million expense recognition of settlements from lump sum payouts during the year. The non-cash settlement charge is reflected in nonoperating expenses as a result of the requirement to expense the unrecognized actuarial losses associated with the lump sum settlements. Our cash contributions were $9.7 million. Using our current plan assumptions, which include an assumed 7.0% return on assets and a discount rate of 3.56%, we expect to record income of $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nWe expect cash contributions for our non-union sponsored pension plans for the next five years to be as follows:\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Expected Cash\nContributions\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 31.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur investment strategy for our pension assets and our related pension contribution funding obligation includes an active interest rate hedging program designed to mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates on each plan's funded position. If the pension discount rate falls, our investment strategy is designed to significantly mitigate such interest rate risk to each pension plan's funded status and our contribution funding obligation. Conversely, if the pension discount rate rises, some portion of the beneficial impact of a rising discount rate on the pension liability will be forgone. The investment program is dynamic and the hedging program is designed to adapt to market conditions.\nIf future actual asset returns fall short of the 7.0% assumption by 1.0% per year, total cash contributions would be $6.3 million higher over the next five years. If future actual asset returns exceed the 7.0% assumption by 1.0% per year, total cash contributions would be $6.4 million lower over the next five years.\nIf future interest rates decrease 100 basis points from January 1, 2020 levels, total cash contributions would be $34.9 million lower over the next five years. This reflects our liability hedging strategy and the impact of BBA 2015 legislation. The liability hedging strategy results in additional asset returns from decreases in interest rates. However, BBA 2015 limits the increase in liabilities from lower interest rates such that the net effect is lower contributions. If interest rates increase 100 basis points from January 1, 2020 levels, total cash contributions would be $40.3 million higher over the next five years.\nContractual Cash Obligations\nThe following

</tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements except for other contractual obligations for service agreements and capital purchases, letters of credit and surety bonds, which are reflected in the above tables.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nPreparation of our financial statements requires accounting policies that involve significant estimates and judgments regarding the amounts included in the financial statements and disclosed in the accompanying notes to the financial statements. We continually review the appropriateness of our accounting policies and the accuracy of our estimates including discussion with the Audit & Ethics Committee of our Board of Directors who make recommendations to management regarding these policies. Even with a thorough process, estimates must be adjusted based on changing circumstances and new information. Management has identified the policies described below as requiring significant judgment and having a potential material impact to our financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition and Revenue-related Reserves\nThe Company's revenues are derived from the transportation services we provide through the delivery of goods over the duration of a shipment. Upon receipt of the bill of lading, the contract existence criteria is met as evidenced by a legally enforceable agreement between two parties where collectability is probable, thus creating the distinct performance obligation. The Company has elected to expense initial direct costs as incurred because the average shipment cycle is less than one week.\nThe YRC Freight and Regional Transportation segments recognize revenue and substantially all the purchased transportation expense on a gross basis because we direct the use of the transportation service provided and remain responsible for the complete and proper shipment.\nInherent within our revenue recognition practices are estimates for revenue associated with shipments in transit and future adjustments to revenue and accounts receivable for billing adjustments and collectability.\nWe record an allowance for doubtful accounts primarily based on historical uncollectible amounts. We also take into account known factors surrounding specific customers and overall collection trends. For the reserve for uncollectible accounts, we primarily use historical write-off experience but may also consider customer-specific factors, overall collection trends and economic conditions as part of our ongoing monitoring of credit. Our process involves performing ongoing credit evaluations of customers, including the market in which they operate and the overall economic conditions. We continually review historical trends and customer specific factors and make adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts as appropriate. Our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled $11.4 million and $11.1 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nGiven the nature of our transportation services, future adjustments may arise which creates variability when establishing the transaction price used to recognize revenue. We have a high volume of performance obligations with similar characteristics, therefore we primarily use historical trends to arrive at estimated reserves. For rerate reserves, which are common for LTL carriers, we assign pricing to bills of lading at the time of shipment based primarily on the weight, general classification of the product, the shipping destination and individual customer discounts. This process is referred to as rating. At various points throughout our process, incorrect ratings could be identified based on many factors, including weight and commodity verifications. Although the majority of rerating occurs in the same month as the original rating, a portion occurs during subsequent periods. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, our financial statements included a rerate reserve as a reduction to Accounts Receivable\u201d of $7.9 million and $12.5 million, respectively.\nFor shipments in transit, we record revenue based on the percentage of service completed as of the period end and recognize delivery costs as incurred. The percentage of service completed for each shipment is based on how far along in the shipment cycle each shipment is in relation to standard transit days. Standard transit days are defined as our published service days between origin zip code and destination zip code. The total revenue earned is accumulated for all shipments in transit at a particular period end and recorded as operating revenue. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, our financial statements included deferred revenue as a reduction to Accounts Receivable\u201d of $25.2 million and $25.7 million, respectively.\nSelf-Insurance for Claims\nWe are self-insured up to certain limits for workers' compensation, third-party liability claims, and cargo loss and damage. We measure the liabilities associated with workers' compensation and third-party liability claims primarily through actuarial methods performed by an independent third-party. Actuarial methods include estimates for the undiscounted liability for claims reported, for claims incurred but not reported and for certain future administrative costs. These estimates are based on historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of costs per claim and the time required to settle claims. The effect of future inflation for costs is considered in the actuarial analysis. Actual claims may vary from these estimates due to a number of factors, including but not limited to, accident frequency and severity, claims management, changes in healthcare costs, legal and judicial developments, and overall economic conditions. We discount the actuarial calculations of claims liabilities for each calendar year to present value based on the average U.S. Treasury rate, during the calendar year of occurrence, for maturities that match the initial expected payout of the liabilities. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had $349.3 million and $350.3 million accrued for outstanding claims, respectively.\nSingle Employer Pension Plans\nEffective July 1, 2008, we froze our qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans for all participating employees not covered by collective bargaining agreements. Given the frozen status of the plans, the key estimates in determining pension cost are return on plan assets and discount rate, each of which are discussed below.\nReturn on Plan Assets\nThe assumption for expected return on plan assets represents a long-term assumption of our portfolio performance that can impact our pension expense. With $900.0 million of plan assets for the YRC Worldwide funded pension plans, a 100-basis-point decrease in the assumption for expected rate of return on assets would increase annual pension expense by approximately\n$8.6 million and would have no effect on the underfunded pension liability reflected on the balance sheet at December 31, 2019.\nWe believe our 2019 expected rate of return of 7.0% is appropriate based on our investment portfolio as well as a review of other objective indices. Although plan investments are subject to short-term market volatility, we believe they are well diversified and closely managed. Our asset allocation as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and targeted long-term asset allocation for the plans are as follows:\nTable 157: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Target\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt Securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Absolute Return\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBased on various market factors, we selected an expected rate of return on assets of 7.0% effective for the 2019 and 2018 valuations. We will continue to review our expected long-term rate of return on an annual basis and revise appropriately.\nDiscount Rate\nThe discount rate refers to the interest rate used to discount the estimated future benefit payments to their present value, also referred to as the benefit obligation. The discount rate allows us to estimate what it would cost to settle the pension obligations as of the measurement date, December 31, and impacts the following year's pension cost. We determine the discount rate by selecting a portfolio of high quality non-callable bonds with interest payments and maturities generally consistent with our expected benefit payments.\nChanges in the discount rate can significantly impact our net pension liability. However, our liability hedging strategy mitigates this impact with changes in asset returns. A 100-basis-point decrease in our discount rate would increase our underfunded pension liability by approximately $27.5 million. That same change would decrease our annual pension expense by approximately $5.4 million, driven by the return on assets. The discount rate can fluctuate considerably over periods depending on overall economic conditions that impact long-term corporate bond yields. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, we used a discount rate to determine benefit obligations of 3.56% and 4.44%, respectively.\nGains and Losses\nGains and losses occur due to changes in the amount of either the projected benefit obligation or plan assets from experience being different than assumed and from changes in assumptions. We recognize an amortization of the net gain or loss as a component of net pension cost for a year if, as of the beginning of the year, that net gain or loss exceeds ten percent of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets. If an amortization is required, it equals the amount of net gain or loss that exceeds the ten percent corridor, amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the pension plans have net losses of $406.1 million and a projected benefit obligation of $1,128.8 million. The average remaining life expectancy of plan participants is approximately 20 years. For 2020, we expect to amortize approximately $15.0 million of the net loss. The comparable amortization amounts for 2019 and 2018 were $12.8 million and $14.6 million, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2019, our plan assets included $536.2 million of investments that are measured at net asset value ( NAV\u201d) per share (or its equivalent) using the practical expedient in accordance with the fair value measurement and $44.8 million of Level 3 investments. Level 3 market values are based on inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and are significant to the fair value of the investment. These investments are subject to estimation to determine fair value which is used to determine components of our annual pension expense and the net liability.\nMulti-Employer Pension Plans\nYRC Freight, Holland, Reddaway and New Penn, contribute to 33 separate multi-employer pension plans for employees covered by our collective bargaining agreements (approximately 79% of total employees of YRC Worldwide and its subsidiaries). The pension plans provide defined benefits to retired participants.\nWe do not directly manage the multi-employer pension plans to which we contribute. Trustees, half of whom the respective union appoints and half of whom various contributing employers appoint, manage the trusts covering these plans.\nOur collective bargaining agreements with the unions determine the amount of our contributions to these plans. We recognize as net pension expense the contractually required contribution for the respective period and recognize as a liability any contributions due and unpaid.\nIn 2006, the Pension Protection Act ( PPA\u201d) became law and modified both the Code, as it applies to multi-employer pension plans and the ERISA. The Code and ERISA (in each case, as so modified) and related regulations establish minimum funding requirements for multi-employer pension plans. The funding status of these plans is determined by many factors.\nIn 2014, the Multi-Employer Pension Reform Act ( MPRA\u201d) became law which modified the ability to suspend accrued benefits of plans facing insolvency by adding a new zone status of Critical and Declining.\nIf any of our multi-employer pension plans fail to:\nTable 158: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> meet minimum funding requirements,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 159: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> meet a required funding improvement or rehabilitation plan that the PPA may require for certain of our underfunded plans,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 160: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> obtain from the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS\u201d) certain changes to or a waiver of the requirements in how the applicable plan calculates its funding levels, or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 161: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> reduce pension benefits to a level where the requirements are met,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nwe could be required to make additional contributions to our multi-employer pension plans.\nIf any of our multi-employer pension plans enters critical status or worse and our contributions are not sufficient to satisfy any rehabilitation plan schedule, the PPA could require us to make additional surcharge contributions to the multi-employer pension plan in the amount of five to ten percent of the existing contributions required by our labor agreement for the remaining term of the labor agreement.\nIf we fail to make our required contributions to a multi-employer pension plan under a funding improvement or rehabilitation plan, it would expose us to penalties including potential withdrawal liability. If the benchmarks that an applicable funding improvement or rehabilitation plan provides for a multi-employer pension plan are not met by the end of a prescribed period, the IRS could impose an excise tax on us and the plan's other contributing employers. These excise taxes are not contributed to the deficient funds, but rather are deposited in the United States general treasury funds.\nDepending on the amount involved, a requirement to increase contributions beyond our contractually agreed rate or the imposition of an excise tax on us could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.\nFunded Status of the Multi-Employer Pension Plans and Contingent Withdrawal Liabilities\nWe received an Annual Funding Notice and, for certain plans, a Notice of Critical Status that provide an indication of the plan's financial health. The plan administrators and trustees of multi-employer pension plans do not, however, routinely provide us with detailed, current information regarding their financials. Much of our information regarding the plan financials historically has been (i) obtained from public filings using publicly available plan asset values, which are often dated, and (ii) based on the limited information available from plan administrators or trustees, which has not been independently validated.\nWe are aware that many of the multi-employer pension plans to which we contribute, including, but not limited to, the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund, Road Carriers Local 707 Pension Fund, New York State Teamsters Conference Pension and Retirement Fund, and Teamsters Local 641 Pension Fund are in critical or critical and declining status.\nBased on information obtained from public filings and from plan administrators and trustees, we believe our portion of the contingent liability in the case of a full withdrawal or termination from all of the multi-employer pension plans to which we contribute would be an estimated $8 billion on a pre-tax basis. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to payment of material withdrawal liability.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method to reflect income taxes on our financial statements. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities by applying enacted tax rates to the differences between the carrying value of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and to loss carryforwards. Tax credit carryforwards are recorded as deferred tax assets. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that the change occurs. We assess the validity of deferred tax assets and loss and tax credit carryforwards and provide valuation allowances when we determine, based on the weight of evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets, losses, or credits will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances are included in our tax provision, or in equity if directly related to other comprehensive income (loss), unless affected by a specific intraperiod allocation which happened in 2017 as described below. In determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, we evaluate factors such as prior years' earnings, loss carry-back\nand carry-forward periods, reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies that potentially enhance the likelihood of the realization of a deferred tax asset. We have not recognized deferred taxes relative to foreign subsidiaries' earnings that are deemed to be permanently reinvested. Any related taxes associated with such earnings are not material.\nYRC Worldwide applies the intraperiod tax allocation rules of ASC 740, Income Taxes ( ASC 740\u201d) to allocate income taxes among continuing operations, other comprehensive income (loss), and additional paid-in capital when our situation meets the criteria as prescribed in the rule.\nWhile the tax effect of net income (loss) before income taxes generally should be computed without regard to the tax effects of net income (loss) before income taxes from the other categories referenced in the preceding paragraph, an exception applies when there is a loss before income taxes and income from those other categories. In that situation, the appropriate tax provision is allocated to the other categories of earnings and a related tax benefit is recorded in net income (loss). This exception to the general rule applies even when a valuation allowance is in place at the beginning and end of the year. While intraperiod tax allocation does not change the overall tax provision, it may result in a gross-up of the individual components, thereby changing the amount of tax provision included in each category. In 2017, the Company met the criteria necessary to apply the exception within the intraperiod tax allocation rules, since it incurred a net loss before income taxes and income was recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). As a result, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $13.3 million in continuing operations (as reported on the statements of consolidated operations) and an offsetting tax expense of $13.3 million in total other comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2017. The total income tax benefit did not change, and the total provision continued to be impacted by the full valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets. There was no domestic deferred benefit recognized in 2019 or 2018, as the exception did not apply. This allocation has no effect on total tax provision or total valuation allowance.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d MD&A\u201d, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. See the introductory section immediately prior to Part I\u201d and Risk Factors in Item 1A\u201d of this report regarding these statements.\nOverview\nThis MD&A includes the following sections:\nOur Business: a brief description of our business and a discussion of how we assess our operating results\nConsolidated Results of Operations: an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017\nReporting Segment Results of Operations: an analysis of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 for our two reporting segments: YRC Freight and Regional Transportation\nCertain Non-GAAP Financial Measures: an analysis of our results using certain non-GAAP financial measures, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017\nLiquidity and Capital Resources: a discussion of our major sources and uses of cash as well as an analysis of our cash flows and aggregate contractual obligations and commercial commitments\nOur Business\nYRC Worldwide is a holding company that, through its operating subsidiaries, offers our customers a wide range of transportation services. YRC Worldwide has one of the largest, most comprehensive LTL networks in North America with local, regional, national and international capabilities. Through its team of experienced service professionals, YRC Worldwide offers industry-leading expertise in LTL shipments and flexible supply chain solutions, ensuring customers can ship industrial, commercial and retail goods with confidence.\nWe measure the performance of our business on both a consolidated and reporting segment basis and using several metrics, but rely primarily upon (without limitation) operating revenue, operating income (loss), and operating ratio. We also use certain non-GAAP financial measures as secondary measures to assess our operating performance.\n \u2022 Operating Revenue: Our operating revenue has two primary components: volume (commonly evaluated using tonnage, tonnage per day, number of shipments, shipments per day or weight per shipment) and yield or price (commonly evaluated using picked up revenue, revenue per hundredweight or revenue per shipment). Yield includes fuel surcharge revenue, which is common in the trucking industry and represents an amount charged to customers that adjusts with changing fuel prices. We base our fuel surcharges on the U.S. Department of Energy fuel index and adjust them weekly. Rapid material changes in the index or our cost of fuel can positively or negatively impact our revenue and operating income as a result of changes in our fuel surcharge. We believe that fuel surcharge is an accepted and important component of the overall pricing of our services to our customers. Without an industry accepted fuel surcharge program, our base pricing for our transportation services would require changes. We believe the distinction between base rates and fuel surcharge has blurred over time, and it is impractical to clearly separate all the different factors that influence the price that our customers are willing to pay. In general, under our present fuel surcharge program, we believe rising fuel costs are beneficial to us and falling fuel costs are detrimental to us in the short term, the effects of which are mitigated over time. \n \u2022 Operating Income (Loss): Operating income (loss) is operating revenue less operating expenses. Consolidated operating income (loss) includes certain corporate charges that are not allocated to our reporting segments. \n \u2022 Operating Ratio: Operating ratio is a common operating performance measure used in the trucking industry. It is calculated as (i) 100 percent (ii) minus the result of dividing operating income by operating revenue or (iii) plus the result of dividing operating loss by operating revenue, and is expressed as a percentage. \n \u2022 Non-GAAP Financial Measures: We use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures, to assess the following: \n \u25e6 EBITDA: a non-GAAP measure that reflects our earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization expense. EBITDA is used for internal management purposes as a financial measure that reflects our core operating performance. \n \u25e6 Adjusted EBITDA: a non-GAAP measure that reflects EBITDA, and further adjusts for letter of credit fees, equity-based compensation expense, net gains or losses on property disposals, restructuring charges, transaction costs related to issuances of debt, non-recurring consulting fees, non-cash impairment charges and the gains or losses from permitted dispositions, discontinued operations, and certain non-cash expenses, charges and losses (provided that if any of such non-cash expenses, charges or losses represents an accrual or reserve for potential cash items in any future period, the cash payment in respect thereof in such future period will be subtracted from Consolidated EBITDA in such future period to the extent paid). All references to Adjusted EBITDA\u201d throughout this section and the rest of this report refer to Adjusted EBITDA\u201d calculated under our New Term Loan Agreement (defined therein as Consolidated EBITDA\u201d unless otherwise specified). Consolidated EBITDA is also a defined term in our ABL Agreement and the definition there aligns with the prior definition of Consolidated EBITDA under the Prior Term Loan Agreement. Adjusted EBITDA is used for internal management purposes as a financial measure that reflects our core operating performance, to measure compliance with financial covenants in our credit facilities and to determine certain management and employee bonus compensation. \nWe believe our presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors and other users as these measures represent key supplemental information our management uses to compare and evaluate our core underlying business results both on a consolidated basis and across our business segments, particularly in light of our leverage position and the capital-intensive nature of our business. Further, EBITDA is a measure that is commonly used by other companies in our industry and provides a comparison for investors to evaluate the performance of the companies in the industry. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA helps investors to understand how the company is tracking against our financial covenant in our term loan credit agreement as this measure is calculated as defined in our term loan credit agreement and serves as a driving component of our key financial covenant.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures have the following limitations:\n \u25e6 EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or fund principal payments on our outstanding debt; \n \u25e6 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or fund principal payments on our outstanding debt, letter of credit fees, restructuring charges, transaction costs related to the issuance of debt, non-cash expenses, charges or losses (subject to the conditions above), or nonrecurring consulting fees, among other items; \n \u25e6 Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will generally need to be replaced in the future and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; \n \u25e6 Equity-based compensation is an element of our long-term incentive compensation package, although Adjusted EBITDA excludes employee equity-based compensation expense when presenting our ongoing operating performance for a particular period; and \n \u25e6 Other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, potentially limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. \nBecause of these limitations, our non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and use our non-GAAP measures as secondary measures.\nNew National Master Freight Agreement\nOn May 14, 2019, union employees at operating companies Holland, New Penn and YRC Freight ratified New NMFA, along with all supplemental agreements. The New NMFA outlines terms and conditions of employment that are customary in collective bargaining agreements and apply at a national level across the covered operations, such as wages, health benefits, multiemployer pension plan contribution rates, and various operational items. A few of the highlights in the New NMFA include:\n \u2022 Hourly wage increases in each year of the contract, beginning April 1, 2019 through 2023 \n \u2022 Health and welfare and pension contribution rate increases \n \u2022 Restoration of an additional one-week of vacation \n \u2022 The expanded ability to utilize smaller trucks that can be operated by employees who do not have a CDL \n \u2022 The ability to utilize additional hours of service, in accordance with Department of Transportation regulations \n \u2022 The increased ability to utilize purchased transportation at YRC Freight and Holland \n \u2022 The increased ability to utilize employees in non-driving positions \n \u2022 A newly-structured performance bonus program for employees \nThe new wage improvements allow us to advance our driver hiring and retention efforts to ensure we are adequately staffed with professional CDL drivers and other key personnel at our service centers. The contractual wage increases under the New NMFA that were paid retroactively to April 1, 2019 include one additional week of vacation that was retroactively applied to 2018. Additionally, the Company incurred one-time vacation charges in second quarter operating results of $12.4 million to reflect the full year 2018 and first quarter 2019 vacation benefit increase.\nThe supplemental agreements cover more localized work rules and other terms and conditions of employment. The Company was unable to commence actions to implement the operational efficiencies until the New NMFA, and all supplements, were fully ratified on May 14, 2019.\nBusiness Strategy Overview\nDuring 2019, the Company launched a multi-year enterprise transformation strategy to achieve long-term profitability and cash flow. Our strategic roadmap is built upon the proven alliance of our LTL regional and national networks, as well as our recently launched multi-mode freight brokerage solutions, to provide a broad portfolio of freight and business services to our customers.\nThe Company accomplished four foundational components during 2019:\n 1. Ratified a new five-year labor contract \n 2. Refinanced a term loan with improved and more flexible terms \n 3. Reorganized the field leadership structure to streamline decision making and enhance execution \n 4. Completed the reorganization of the enterprise-wide sales force \nLabor contract: During the first half of 2019, the Company ratified the New NMFA for the employees of Holland, New Penn and YRC Freight. The New NMFA is a critical element to the comprehensive strategic plan as it provides the Company with important changes to create a foundation for operational excellence and capacity expansion, which should lead to improved profitability. The operational changes are expected to provide efficiencies in our workforce by introducing new job classifications and allowing us to employ more flexible work rules to optimize the use of our valuable employee resources. These changes allow us to improve labor mix which should result in reduced costs per labor hour. For example, prior to the New NMFA, we were unable to fill part-time positions in many key markets across our footprint due to a non-competitive wage package for part-time employees. With the New NMFA, we have the opportunity to expand our part-time work force which allows us to reposition our commercial driver's license ( CDL\u201d) drivers to freight delivery and to deploy part-time employees to dock positions, resulting in lower employee compensation expense and improved productivity. The expansion of purchased transportation that is permitted under the New NMFA (increased to 29% of total linehaul miles for YRC Freight and introduced an 8% limit for Holland) provides us opportunities to plan and source our operations using more cost-effective resources and to expand our capacity consistent with our customer growth and engagement initiatives. The New NMFA also allows us to introduce new equipment, referred to as box trucks, into our LTL freight operations, which, along with new non-CDL driver classifications, permits us to provide a lower cost solution to local cartage or short-term rentals. Further, on September 27, 2019, the Company ratified a new two-year collective bargaining agreement for the employees of Reddaway, who were previously party to multiple bargaining agreements, and have now been combined into one collective agreement.\nCapital Structure Update: The Company announced a refinancing of its term loan obligations on September 11, 2019 and entered into a New Term Loan Agreement, which provides for additional liquidity, less restrictive financial covenants, a lower interest rate and extends the maturity of the facility to June 2024. The New Term Loan eliminates the annual principal amortization of 3.0%, which approximated $18.0 million in principal payments per year, and provides the ability to reinvest the first $40.0 million in cash proceeds earned from the sale of certain owned properties.\nEnhanced Organization Structure: Creating simplified engagement for customers and an improved service offering is a critical part of our strategic focus on growth and engagement. We completed the final phase of our sales restructuring which consolidated our four distinct sales groups into one enterprise-wide sales organization. This allows customers to buy regional, national and brokerage services from a single point of contact at YRCW while introducing existing customers to all our operating companies. The launch of our third-party brokerage solution, HNRY Logistics in late 2018, is the perfect complement to our LTL, asset-based companies and allows us to better service our customers with a full suite of logistics solutions. In addition, we implemented a new field operations structure to align with our enterprise transformation strategy to streamline decision making and enhance execution of our network enhancements\nGoing into 2020, the next phase of our transformation includes:\n 1. Operational optimization \n 2. Technology migration \n 3. Facility evaluation \nThe primary focus for the next phase of the enterprise transformation strategy is to operationally transform the movement of freight through our network and the technology used in the process. In the initial phase of our plan to optimize operations, which spanned most of 2019, two of our companies operate independently out of the same service center. Under the New NMFA that was ratified on May 14, 2019, we have the opportunity to consolidate service centers across our operating companies to optimize utilization of our assets and resources, and companies that operate in the same service territory will be serviced through one primary carrier. We believe service center consolidation presents the greatest opportunity for this initiative. We launched our first consolidation in late 2019, with the emphasis of facility evaluation occurring in 2020. By rationalizing the number of physical locations in the network while maintaining geographic coverage, we will continue to provide the same service level to our valued customers. We expect these efforts should allow us to recognize cost savings in our linehaul and pick-up and delivery operations due to improved density, increased asset utilization, and optimization of route planning and labor resources. Over time, this initiative should enhance service and strategically position our network for the growing demand of our customers and their supply chain needs, provide productivity improvements and streamline our cost structure as we seek to optimize resources across the network, in facilities, infrastructure and human capital.\nCapital investment remains a top priority for us. While ongoing investments in equipment and technology remain our primary use of operating cash flows, we understand the importance of balancing liquidity and our ongoing investments with the service and capacity we need to bring to the market. To properly execute on our transformation plan, we are committed to investing in technology in order to enhance the customer experience and improve our operational flexibilities. We intend to consolidate individual operating company systems into a single platform, with the end goal of improving profitability and the customer experience. By streamlining systems, we are providing our customers access to five brands through one network and one enterprise-wide service offering. We remain committed to investment in revenue equipment to improve the age of our fleet as there is an immediate return in improved fuel miles per gallon and reduced vehicle maintenance expense.\nSegments\nEffective January 1, 2020, the Company will realign its reportable segments as a result of an enhanced organizational structure implemented in the back half of 2019 designed to better align resources and provide greater focus on the Company's multi-year enterprise transformation strategy. The strategy is designed to improve the long-term profitability and stability of the Company, with key focus on enhancing competitive value proposition. Key elements of the enterprise transformation include operational optimization to bolster asset utilization and to leverage flexibilities gained from the new labor contract; facility evaluation to build density and create cost savings by consolidating service centers while fully protecting all brands and areas of service; and customer growth/engagement initiatives to enhance customer experience and improve our value proposition by supplying all of our service offerings and brands as one. We realigned sales to consolidate our four distinct sales groups into one enterprise sales organization. This allows customers to buy regional, national and brokerage services from a single point of contact at YRCW while introducing existing customers to additional operating companies.\nWe also implemented a new field structure to align with our enterprise transformation strategy to streamline decision making and enhance execution of our network enhancements. With the ratification of the New NMFA on May 14, 2019, the Company may now combine service centers across our operating companies to optimize utilization of our assets and resources, and the companies that operate in the same service territory will be serviced through one primary carrier.\nThe presentation of financial results as one reportable segment is consistent with the way the Company has transformed its operational leadership team under the Chief Operating Decision Maker ( CODM\u201d) where he formerly had the operating company presidents as direct reports and now has direct reports who are functional leaders whose roles span across the entire\nenterprise. Starting in 2020, the CODM will be evaluating our performance and business results, as well as making resource and operating decisions under the single segment view.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nOur consolidated results for 2019, 2018 and 2017 include the consolidated results of our reporting segments and unallocated corporate charges. A more detailed discussion of the operating results of our reporting segments is presented in the Reporting Segment Results of Operations\u201d section below.\nThe table below provides summary consolidated financial information for the three years ended December 31:\nTable 107: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2019 vs. 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2018 vs. 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,871.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,092.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,891.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.3\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 142.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 119.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (88.7\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Nonoperating expenses, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 124.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 111.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 137.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18.6\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (104.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/M*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 287.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(*) not meaningful\n2019 Compared to 2018\nOur consolidated operating revenue decreased $220.8 million, or 4.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018. The decrease in revenue is primarily attributed to a decrease in tonnage and fuel surcharge revenue, while partially offset by an increase in base yield excluding fuel surcharge.\nOperating expenses decreased $94.1 million, or 1.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to lower purchased transportation expense and lower fuel, operating expenses and supplies, partially offset by increased salaries, wages and employee benefits.\nSalaries, wages and employee benefits. Salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $13.7 million, or 0.5%, primarily due to a $35.5 million increase in benefits costs which was largely driven by a $25.8 increase in union vacation expense due to restoration of benefits from the passage of the New NMFA, a $15.7 million increase in workers' compensation expense, and a $6.8 million increase in salaries expense. These increases were partially offset by a $32.9 million reduction in short-term incentive compensation and an $11.3 million decrease in wages expense as a result of tonnage decreases that reduced the number of hours needed to process freight which were partially offset by contractual rate increases due to the New NMFA.\nFuel, operating expenses and supplies. Fuel, operating expenses and supplies decreased $51.2 million, or 5.4%, primarily due to a $48.1 million decrease in fuel expense, which was largely a result of lower fuel prices and fewer miles driven.\nPurchased transportation. Purchased transportation decreased $69.0 million, or 10.1%, primarily due to a $68.3 million decrease in rail and over-the-road purchased transportation expense as a result of reduced tonnage, a $9.3 million decrease from reduced usage of local purchased transportation, and a $5.9 million decrease in short-term vehicle rents. These decreases were partially offset by an $18.5 million increase in third-party costs due to the expansion in third-party logistics solutions.\nOther operating expenses. Other operating expenses decreased $7.6 million, or 3.1%, primarily due to a decrease of $4.2 million in cargo claims expense, and a $4.0 million reduction in operating taxes as a result of fewer miles driven.\nGains/losses on property disposals. Net gains on disposals of property were $13.7 million during 2019 as compared to $20.8 million in 2018. The gains in 2019 and 2018 were primarily related to the sale of real properties, including a $29.3 million gain from the sale of one excess property at YRC Freight during 2018.\nNonoperating expenses, net. Nonoperating expenses increased $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to an $11.2 million expense in 2019 related to the extinguishment of debt with no such charge in 2018, a $5.4 million increase in interest expense due to higher interest rates and outstanding debt balances during 2019, which were partially offset by a $6.3 million decrease in non-union pension costs due mainly to a reduction in non-cash pension settlement expenses.\nImpairment charges. During the first quarter of 2019, the company recorded an $8.2 million impairment charge that reflects the write-down of an intangible asset as a result of rebranding strategies, leading to the discontinued use of a tradename.\nOur effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was 4.0% and 35.5%, respectively. Significant items impacting the 2019 rate include a provision for net state and foreign taxes, certain permanent items, and a change in the valuation allowance established for the net deferred tax asset balance at December 31, 2019. We recognize valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, if, based on the weight of the evidence, we believe that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances are included in our tax provision or in equity if directly related to other comprehensive income (loss) in the period of change. In determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, we evaluate factors such as prior years' earnings history, expected future earnings, loss carry-back and carry-forward periods, reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies that potentially enhance the likelihood of the realization of a deferred tax asset. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we have a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets, exclusive of a deferred tax (asset) liability related to a foreign jurisdiction.\nIn July 2011, July 2013, and January 2014, we experienced significant changes in the ownership of our stock, as measured for Federal income tax purposes. These changes triggered the application of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the Code\u201d), which will likely have no substantial impact on the use of tax net operating loss carryovers ( NOLs\u201d) generated through January 31, 2014 and prior to offset future taxable income. While Section 382 changes may adversely affect cash flow, they have no impact on our current financial statements. The deferred tax assets resulting from the existing NOLs to which a Section 382 change applies are already fully offset by a valuation allowance.\n2018 Compared to 2017\nOur consolidated operating revenue increased $201.0 million, or 4.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The increase in revenue was largely attributed to increased base yield excluding fuel surcharge and fuel surcharge revenue, while partially offset by a decrease in tonnage.\nOperating expenses increased $177.1 million, or 3.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, due to an increase in salaries, wages and employee benefits, an increase in purchased transportation expense, and higher fuel costs, which were partially offset by an increase in gains on property disposals.\nSalaries, wages and employee benefits. Salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $65.8 million, or 2.3%, primarily due to a $49.2 million increase in employee benefit costs, which are primarily related to contractual rate increases for union employees, and a $29.8 million increase in short-term incentive compensation for employees at various levels in the organization. These increases were partially offset by a $10.9 million decrease in wages due to a decrease in shipping volumes, which required fewer employee hours to process freight.\nFuel, operating expenses and supplies. Fuel, operating expenses and supplies increased $72.7 million, or 8.4%, primarily due to a $52.7 million increase in fuel expenses driven by higher fuel prices on a per gallon basis, partially offset by fewer miles driven and improved miles per gallon. The increase in operating expenses was also due to an increase of $6.9 million in facility related expense primarily due to increased rent expense at our leased terminal locations.\nPurchased transportation. Purchased transportation increased $55.7 million, or 8.9%, primarily due to a $35.8 million increase in vehicle rent expense, mostly related to a $32.9 million increase in long-term rental expense in conjunction with the Company's leasing strategy to invest in revenue equipment. Purchased transportation expense also includes a $29.6 million increase in third-party costs due to the expansion in customer-specific logistics solutions. These increases were partially offset by a $12.2 million decrease in local purchased transportation due to reduced usage.\nOther operating expenses. Other operating expenses increased $3.1 million, or 1.3%, primarily due to an increase of $8.1 million in our third-party liability claims expense primarily due to current year claims, partially offset by a $4.6 million decrease in cargo claims expense.\nGains/losses on property disposals. Net gains on disposals of property were $20.8 million in 2018 compared to net gains of $0.6 million in 2017. The gains in 2018 were primarily related to the sale of real properties, including a $29.3 million gain from the sale of an excess property at YRC Freight.\nNonoperating expenses, net. Nonoperating expenses decreased $25.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to an $11.2 million decrease in net periodic pension cost. Additionally, in 2017 we incurred $8.1 million in transaction costs related to debt amendments with no corresponding expense in 2018.\nOur effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was 35.5% and 40.3%, respectively. Significant items impacting the 2018 rate include a provision for net state and foreign taxes, foreign withholding taxes related to dividends from a foreign subsidiary, certain permanent items, and a change in the valuation allowance established for the net deferred tax asset balance at December 31, 2018. Significant items impacting the 2017 rate include a benefit recognized due to application of the exception to the rules regarding intraperiod tax allocation, a provision for net state and foreign taxes, certain permanent items,\nand a change in the valuation allowance established for the net deferred tax asset balance at December 31, 2017. We recognize valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, if, based on the weight of the evidence, we believe that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances are included in our tax provision or in equity if directly related to other comprehensive income (loss) in the period of change. In determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, we evaluate factors such as prior years' earnings history, expected future earnings, loss carry-back and carry-forward periods, reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies that potentially enhance the likelihood of the realization of a deferred tax asset. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we have a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets, exclusive of a deferred tax liability related to a foreign jurisdiction.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) was enacted in the U.S. on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act reduced the US federal corporate income tax rate to 21% from 35%, required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and created new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings. The Company adopted the guidance provided by Securities and Exchange Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d) regarding the public disclosures of certain accounting impacts of the Tax Act. In 2017 and the first nine months of 2018, the Company recorded provisional amounts for certain enactment date effects by applying the guidance in SAB 118 because we had not yet completed our enactment date accounting for these effects. All provisional amounts were finalized for the 2018 Form 10-K as required by SAB 118. This includes the federal and state income tax effects of newly enacted one-time transition tax. Such finalization had no net impact on the tax provision for 2018, as it merely adjusted net operating loss carry-forward amounts and was fully offset by a valuation allowance.\nReporting Segment Results of Operations\nWe evaluate our business using our two reporting segments:\n \u2022 YRC Freight is the reporting segment that focuses on longer haul business opportunities with national, regional and international services. YRC Freight provides for the movement of industrial, commercial and retail goods. This reporting segment includes YRC Freight, our LTL subsidiary, YRC Freight Canada, a subsidiary located in Canada that specializes in shipments into, across and out of Canada, and HNRY Logistics, our logistics solutions provider. In addition to the United States and Canada, YRC Freight also serves parts of Mexico and Puerto Rico. \n \u2022 Regional Transportation is the reporting segment for our transportation service providers focused on business opportunities in the regional and next-day delivery markets. Regional Transportation is comprised of Holland, New Penn and Reddaway. These companies each provide regional, next-day ground services in their respective regions through a network of facilities located across the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico. \nYRC Freight Results\nYRC Freight represented 63% of our consolidated operating revenue in 2019, 2018 and 2017.

The decrease in revenue was largely driven by a decrease in tonnage and fuel surcharge revenue, while partially offset by an increase in base LTL yield excluding fuel surcharge.

adjustments for shipments in transit and the impact of other revenue. \n (b) Percent change based on unrounded figures and not rounded figures presented. \nOperating income for YRC Freight was $38.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $46.7 million from the same period in 2018. Operating expenses decreased $61.9 million primarily due to decreases in purchased transportation expense and fuel, operating expenses and supplies. These decreases were partially offset by increased salaries, wages and employee benefits.\nSalaries, wages and employee benefits. Salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $7.2 million, or 0.4%, primarily due to a $21.9 million increase in benefits costs which was largely driven by a $16.8 million increase in union vacation expense due to restoration of benefits from the passage of the New NMFA, and a $2.9 million increase in salaries expense. These increases were partially offset by a $9.0 million decrease in wage expense as a result of a decrease in tonnage that reduced the number of hours needed to process freight, which was partially offset by contractual rate increases as a result of the New NMFA, as well as an $8.2 million reduction in short-term incentive compensation.\nFuel, operating expenses and supplies. Fuel, operating expenses and supplies decreased $42.9 million, or 7.2%, primarily due to a $28.7 million decrease in fuel expenses driven by lower fuel prices on a per gallon basis, fewer miles driven and improved miles per gallon. Also, professional fees decreased by $9.2 million primarily due to decreased management fees of corporate and other enterprise-wide shared services and other corporate service fees and consulting fees.\nPurchased Transportation. Purchased transportation decreased $49.7 million, or 9.3%, primarily due to a $49.8 million decrease in rail and over-the-road purchased transportation expense as a result of reduced shipping volumes, an $11.1 million\ndecrease from reduced usage of local purchased transportation, and a $5.5 million decrease in short-term vehicle rents. These decreases were partially offset by an $18.5 million increase in third-party costs due to the expansion in customer-specific logistics solutions.\nGains/losses on property disposals. Net gains on disposals of property were $9.8 million during 2019 as compared to $20.2 million in 2018. The gains in 2019 and 2018 were primarily related to the sale of real properties, including a $29.3 million gain from the sale of one excess property during 2018.\nImpairment charges. During the first quarter of 2019, the company recorded an $8.2 million impairment charge that reflects the write-down of an intangible asset as a result of rebranding strategies, leading to the discontinued use of a tradename.\n2018 Compared to 2017\nYRC Freight reported operating revenue of $3,197.3 million in 2018, an increase of $129.4 million, or 4.2%, compared to 2017. The increase in revenue was largely driven by an increase in base yield excluding fuel surcharge and fuel surcharge revenue, partially offset by a decrease in tonnage.

year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $24.3 million from the same period in 2017. Operating expenses increased $105.1 million primarily due to an increase in salaries, wages and employee benefits, an increase in purchased transportation expense, and higher fuel costs, which were partially offset by an increase in gains on property disposals.\nSalaries, wages and employee benefits. Salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $21.3 million, or 1.2%, primarily due to a $33.0 million increase in employee benefit costs, which are primarily related to contractual rate increases for union employees, and a $6.1 million increase in short-term incentive compensation for employees at various levels in the organization. These increases were partially offset by an $11.7 million decrease in wages due to a decrease in shipping volumes, which required fewer employee hours to process freight. Additionally, workers' compensation expense decreased $6.1 million mainly due to favorable development on prior year claims.\nFuel, operating expenses and supplies. Fuel, operating expenses and supplies increased $51.7 million, or 9.5%, primarily due to a $26.2 million increase in fuel expenses driven by higher fuel prices on a per gallon basis, partially offset by fewer miles driven and improved miles per gallon. Also, professional fees increased by $21.0 million primarily due to increased management fees and other corporate service fees and non-recurring consulting fees.\nPurchased Transportation. Purchased transportation increased $55.0 million, or 11.5%, primarily due to a $33.5 million increase in vehicle rent expense of which $30.6 million was attributable to long-term rentals in conjunction with the Company's leasing strategy to invest in revenue equipment. Purchased transportation expense also includes a $29.6 million increase in third-party costs due to the expansion in customer-specific logistics solutions. These costs were partially offset by an $11.3 million decrease from reduced usage of local purchased transportation.\nOther operating expenses. Other operating expenses decreased $2.1 million, or 1.4%, primarily due to a $6.1 million decrease in cargo claims expense, partially offset by an increase of $4.1 million in our third-party liability claims expense primarily due to current year claims.\nGains/losses on property disposals. Net gains on disposals of property were $20.2 million in 2018 compared to net gains of $2.2 million in 2017, primarily due to the sale of real properties. The 2018 gain includes a $29.3 million gain on the sale of an excess property.\nRegional Transportation Results\nRegional Transportation represented 37% of consolidated operating revenue in 2019, 2018 and 2017.

These decreases were partially offset by an increase in salaries, wages and employee benefits.\nSalaries, wages and employee benefits. Salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $17.9 million, or 1.6%, primarily due to a $15.5 million increase in workers' compensation expense and a $13.8 million increase in employee benefits costs which was largely driven by an $9.0 million increase in union vacation expense due to restoration of benefits from the passage of the New NMFA. These increases were partially offset by an $8.3 million reduction in short-term incentive compensation and a $2.5 million decrease in wage expense as a result of a decrease in tonnage that reduced the number of hours needed to process freight, which was partially offset by contractual rate increases as a result of the New NMFA.\nFuel, operating expenses and supplies. Fuel, operating expenses and supplies decreased $22.6 million, or 5.7%, primarily due to a $19.4 million decrease in fuel expense, which was largely driven by fewer miles driven and lower prices.\nOther operating expenses.

for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $2.8 million from the same period in 2017. Operating expenses increased $68.8 million primarily due to higher fuel costs, an increase in contractual wages and employee benefit costs, and an increase in vehicle maintenance expense.\nSalaries, wages and employee benefits. Salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $20.0 million, or 1.8%, primarily due to a $14.3 million increase in employee benefit costs, which are primarily related to contractual rate increases for union employees, and a $6.6 million increase in short-term incentive compensation for employees at various levels in the organization. These increases were partially offset by a $4.1 million decrease in workers' compensation expense mainly due to favorable development on prior year claims.\nFuel, operating expenses and supplies. Fuel, operating expenses and supplies increased $43.1 million, or 12.2%, primarily due to a $26.5 million increase in fuel expenses driven by higher fuel prices on a per gallon basis, partially offset by fewer miles driven. Additionally, vehicle maintenance expense increased $8.2 million primarily due to the timing of revenue equipment additions, and professional fees increased $3.8 million due to increased management and other corporate service fees.\nOther operating expenses. Other operating expenses increased $5.1 million, or 5.4%, primarily due to an increase of $3.9 million increase in our third-party liability claims expense primarily due to current year claims and a $1.5 million increase in cargo claims expense.\nCertain Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAs discussed in the Our Business\u201d section, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures to assess performance. These measures should be considered in addition to the results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, our GAAP financial measures. For segment Adjusted EBITDA, we present the reconciliation from operating income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA as it is consistent with how we measure performance.\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA\nThe

As of December 31, 2019, our maximum availability under our ABL Facility was $37.7 million, and our managed accessibility is $0.2 million. Maximum availability is derived by reducing the amount that may be advanced against eligible receivables plus eligible borrowing base cash by certain reserves imposed by the ABL Agent and our $337.8 million of outstanding letters of credit. Our Managed Accessibility of $0.2 million represents the maximum amount we would access on the ABL Facility and is adjusted for eligible receivables plus eligible borrowing base cash measured as of December 31, 2019. If eligible receivables fall below the threshold management uses to measure availability, which is 10% of the borrowing line, the credit agreement governing the ABL Facility permits adjustments from eligible borrowing base cash to restricted cash prior to the compliance measurement date of January 15, 2020. As of January 15, 2020, we had less than 10% of the borrowing line in eligible receivables and moved $29.0 million of cash into restricted cash, as permitted under the ABL Facility, which effectively put our cash and cash equivalents and Managed Accessibility to $80.4 million as of December 31, 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our availability under our ABL Facility was $39.2 million. Of the $39.2 million in availability, Managed Accessibility was $1.2 million. Our cash and cash equivalents and Managed Accessibility was $203.8 million as of December 31, 2018.\nThe table below summarizes cash and cash equivalents and Managed Accessibility for the years ended December 31:\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 109.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 227.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: amounts placed into restricted cash subsequent to year-end\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (29.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (25.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Managed Accessibility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cash and cash equivalents and Managed Accessibility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 80.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 203.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOutside of funding normal operations, our principal uses of cash include making contributions to our various multi-employer pension funds and single-employer pension plans, and meeting our other cash obligations, including, but not limited to, paying principal and interest on our funded debt, payments on equipment leases and investments in capital expenditures.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our Standard & Poor's Corporate Family Rating was B-\u201d with a stable outlook and Moody's Investor Service Corporate Family Rating was B2\u201d with a positive outlook.\nCredit Facility Covenants\nThe New Term Loan Agreement includes a financial covenant requirement for the Company to maintain a minimum of $200.0 million trailing-twelve-month Adjusted EBITDA, measured quarterly. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, defined in our New Term Loan Agreement as Consolidated EBITDA,\u201d is a measure that reflects our earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization expense, and is further adjusted for, among other things, letter of credit fees, equity-based compensation expense, net gains or losses on property disposals, restructuring charges, transaction costs related to issuances of debt, non-recurring consulting fees, non-cash impairment charges, integration costs, severance, non-recurring charges and the gains or losses from permitted dispositions, discontinued operations, and certain non-cash expenses, charges and losses (provided that if any of such non-cash expenses, charges or losses represents an accrual or reserve for potential cash items in any future period, the cash payment in respect thereof in such future period will be subtracted from Consolidated EBITDA in such future period to the extent paid). The definition was further modified under the New Term Loan Agreement such that certain expenses that qualify as adjustments are capped at 10.0% of the trailing-twelve-month Adjusted EBITDA. Adjustments subject to the 10.0% cap include, but are not limited to, restructuring charges, integration costs, severance, and non-recurring charges. Additionally, all net gains from the disposition of properties are excluded from the definition of Adjusted EBITDA, therefore any gains previously recognized in Adjusted EBITDA, as that term was previously defined in our SEC filings prior to our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2019, in accordance with its definition in the Prior Term Loan Agreement, will not be included in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA under the New Term Loan Agreement. Further, for all years presented in this Annual Form 10-K, the presentation of adjusted EBITDA has been updated to reflect this new definition. Our trailing twelve month Adjusted EBITDA as of December 31, 2019 was $210.6 million.\nThe ABL Facility also contains certain affirmative and negative covenants with which we must comply.\nRisks and Uncertainties Regarding Compliance with Credit Facility Financial Covenants\nUnder the New Term Loan, we are required to maintain at least $200.0 million in Adjusted EBITDA on a TTM basis measured each quarter until maturity (June 2024). For the TTM period ended December 31, 2019, we achieved Adjusted EBITDA of $210.6 million. We believe that our results of operations will allow us to comply with the minimum Adjusted EBITDA covenant for at least the next twelve months. Our ability to comply is subject to a more stable and robust freight environment and continued actions and cost savings initiatives we began in the fourth quarter of 2019 and continue today. These actions and initiatives include headcount reductions commensurate with our current volume levels, a hiring freeze on new and replacement positions, temporary elimination of short-term incentive compensation, and a reduction in discretionary spend.\nWe began taking these actions because of the freight recession our industry experienced in 2019, and that has persisted into early first quarter 2020, that negatively impacted our ability to fully realize operational efficiencies arising from our New NMFA with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters primarily due to the ensuing depressed volume levels and the inherent contractual cost increase associated with the New NMFA. Our ability to satisfy our liquidity needs and meet our minimum Adjusted EBITDA requirement during the next twelve months and thereafter is dependent upon our ability to improve operating performance over 2019 to offset the contractual wage and benefit increases under the New NMFA and other inflationary expense increases associated with among other things our employees and insurance programs.\nWe may extend and or supplement the actions we began taking in 2019 if we continue to experience adverse conditions such as lower volumes, pricing, yield or lower productivities among others, that might impact our forecasted performance. If we are unable to achieve the results required to comply with this covenant in one or more quarters over the next twelve months, we may be required to take specific actions in addition to those described above, including but not limited to, additional reductions in headcount and targeted procurement initiatives to reduce operating costs and, or alternatively, seek a waiver or an amendment from our lenders. Obtaining a waiver or an amendment is not within our control, and if unsuccessful, the lenders may exercise the rights available to them under the New Term Loan.\nCash Flow\nOperating Cash Flow\nCash flow from operations decreased by $203.3 million to $21.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $224.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in cash flow is primarily related to a $124.2 million decrease in net income, and the remaining difference is primarily related to timing differences in working capital accounts.\nCash flow from operations increased by $164.1 million to $224.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $60.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in cash flow is primarily related to $55.2 million in changes to accounts receivables from an improvement in days sales outstanding, and a $52.8 million decrease in minimum cash contributions for the non-union pension plans. Cash provided by operations also improved due to a $31.0 million increase in net income.\nInvesting Cash Flow\nCash used in investing activities was $117.3 million in 2019 compared to $109.0 million in 2018, primarily due to a net decrease in proceeds from the disposal of property and equipment of $10.5 million.\nCash used in investing activities was $109.0 million in 2018 compared to $94.5 million in 2017, primarily due to an increase in acquisition costs for revenue equipment. Partially offsetting this increase, net proceeds from the disposal of property and equipment increased $27.6 million mainly due to the sale of real properties.\nSee a detailed discussion of 2019 and 2018 capital expenditures below in Capital Expenditures\u201d for further information.\nFinancing Cash Flow\nNet cash used in financing activities for 2019 was $22.6 million, which consists primarily of $579.0 million in repayments of our long-term debt, offset by the issuance of $570.0 million of long-term debt for the New Term Loan, in addition to $12.7 million in deferred debt issuance costs incurred.\nNet cash used in financing activities for 2018 was $33.9 million, which consists primarily of $31.9 million in repayments of our long-term debt.\nNet cash used in financing activities for 2017 was $96.2 million, which consists primarily of $79.3 million in repayments of our long-term debt, of which $61.9 million was in addition to regularly scheduled principal payments, as well as $14.5 million in debt issuance costs incurred during the year related to our financing transactions.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur capital expenditures focus primarily on the replacement of revenue equipment, investments in information technology and improvements to land and structures. Our business is capital intensive with significant investments in tractors, trailers, refurbished engines, and service center facilities. We determine the amount and timing of capital expenditures based on numerous factors, including fleet age, service center condition, viability of IT systems, anticipated liquidity levels, economic conditions, new or expanded services, regulatory actions and availability of financing.\nThe table below summarizes our actual net capital expenditures (proceeds) by type of investment for the years ended December 31:\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition of property and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 88.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 79.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 35.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Land and structures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Technology\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 143.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 145.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 103.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Proceeds from disposal of property and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Land and structures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (22.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (32.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Technology\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total proceeds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (25.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (36.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total net capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 117.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 109.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 94.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur capital expenditures for revenue equipment were used primarily to fund the purchase of tractors, trailers and containers and to refurbish engines for our revenue fleet.\nWe also acquire our equipment through operating leases which will vary based on anticipated liquidity and lease financing options.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we entered into new operating lease commitments for revenue equipment totaling $111.0 million, with such payments to be made over an average lease term of 4 years with a capital equivalent value of $131.8 million. As of December 31, 2019, our operating lease obligations through 2030 totaled 451.1 million and are expected to increase as we lease additional revenue equipment in future years.\nContractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments\nThe following sections provide aggregated information regarding our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2019.\nNon-Union Pension Obligations\nWe provide defined benefit pension plans for certain employees not covered by collective bargaining agreements. The qualified plans, which include the Yellow Corporation Pension Plan, the Roadway LLC Pension Plan and the YRC Retirement Pension Plan (collectively held in the YRC Worldwide Inc. Master Pension Plans Trust or Trust\u201d) cover approximately 9,000 employees including those currently receiving benefits and those who have left the company with deferred benefits. On January 1, 2004, the existing qualified benefit plans were closed to new participants. On July 1, 2008, the benefit accrual for participants was frozen.\nIn 2015, we adopted the legislative changes provided by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 ( BBA 2015\u201d) which was signed into law on November 2, 2015. This legislation extends the use of longer-term, stabilized interest rate assumptions for measuring pension obligations under the minimum funding requirements. We expect to make the plan contributions as required by BBA 2015 and other regulations.\nDuring 2017, the Company amended the domestic qualified pension plans to provide for an automatic commencement of benefit at age 65, regardless of employment status. Also during 2017, the Yellow Transportation Plan was amended to permit the payment of lump sum benefit payments for those participants who reached age 65. Additionally, the Yellow Transportation Plan was amended to permit the payment of lump sum benefit payments effective January 1, 2018. These amendments are consistent with the Company's continued long-term strategy of de-risking the qualified pension plans.\nDuring 2019, our net pension expense was $2.6 million. This amount included a $1.8 million expense recognition of settlements from lump sum payouts during the year. The non-cash settlement charge is reflected in nonoperating expenses as a result of the requirement to expense the unrecognized actuarial losses associated with the lump sum settlements. Our cash contributions were $9.7 million. Using our current plan assumptions, which include an assumed 7.0% return on assets and a discount rate of 3.56%, we expect to record income of $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nWe expect cash contributions for our non-union sponsored pension plans for the next five years to be as follows:\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Expected Cash\nContributions\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 31.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur investment strategy for our pension assets and our related pension contribution funding obligation includes an active interest rate hedging program designed to mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates on each plan's funded position. If the pension discount rate falls, our investment strategy is designed to significantly mitigate such interest rate risk to each pension plan's funded status and our contribution funding obligation. Conversely, if the pension discount rate rises, some portion of the beneficial impact of a rising discount rate on the pension liability will be forgone. The investment program is dynamic and the hedging program is designed to adapt to market conditions.\nIf future actual asset returns fall short of the 7.0% assumption by 1.0% per year, total cash contributions would be $6.3 million higher over the next five years. If future actual asset returns exceed the 7.0% assumption by 1.0% per year, total cash contributions would be $6.4 million lower over the next five years.\nIf future interest rates decrease 100 basis points from January 1, 2020 levels, total cash contributions would be $34.9 million lower over the next five years. This reflects our liability hedging strategy and the impact of BBA 2015 legislation. The liability hedging strategy results in additional asset returns from decreases in interest rates. However, BBA 2015 limits the increase in liabilities from lower interest rates such that the net effect is lower contributions. If interest rates increase 100 basis points from January 1, 2020 levels, total cash contributions would be $40.3 million higher over the next five years.\nContractual Cash Obligations\nThe following table reflects cash outflows that we are contractually obligated to make as of December 31, 2019:\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td>

imposed by the ABL Agent and our outstanding letters of credit. \n (b) Letters of credit outstanding are generally required as collateral to support self-insurance programs and do not represent additional liabilities as the underlying self-insurance accruals are already included in our consolidated balance sheets. \n (c) Surety bonds are generally required for workers' compensation to support self-insurance programs, which include certain bonds that do not have an expiration date but are redeemable on demand, and do not represent additional liabilities as the underlying self-insurance accruals are already included in our consolidated balance sheets. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements except for other contractual obligations for service agreements and capital purchases, letters of credit and surety bonds, which are reflected in the above tables.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nPreparation of our financial statements requires accounting policies that involve significant estimates and judgments regarding the amounts included in the financial statements and disclosed in the accompanying notes to the financial statements. We continually review the appropriateness of our accounting policies and the accuracy of our estimates including discussion with the Audit & Ethics Committee of our Board of Directors who make recommendations to management regarding these policies. Even with a thorough process, estimates must be adjusted based on changing circumstances and new information. Management has identified the policies described below as requiring significant judgment and having a potential material impact to our financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition and Revenue-related Reserves\nThe Company's revenues are derived from the transportation services we provide through the delivery of goods over the duration of a shipment. Upon receipt of the bill of lading, the contract existence criteria is met as evidenced by a legally enforceable agreement between two parties where collectability is probable, thus creating the distinct performance obligation. The Company has elected to expense initial direct costs as incurred because the average shipment cycle is less than one week.\nThe YRC Freight and Regional Transportation segments recognize revenue and substantially all the purchased transportation expense on a gross basis because we direct the use of the transportation service provided and remain responsible for the complete and proper shipment.\nInherent within our revenue recognition practices are estimates for revenue associated with shipments in transit and future adjustments to revenue and accounts receivable for billing adjustments and collectability.\nWe record an allowance for doubtful accounts primarily based on historical uncollectible amounts. We also take into account known factors surrounding specific customers and overall collection trends. For the reserve for uncollectible accounts, we primarily use historical write-off experience but may also consider customer-specific factors, overall collection trends and economic conditions as part of our ongoing monitoring of credit. Our process involves performing ongoing credit evaluations of customers, including the market in which they operate and the overall economic conditions. We continually review historical trends and customer specific factors and make adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts as appropriate. Our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled $11.4 million and $11.1 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nGiven the nature of our transportation services, future adjustments may arise which creates variability when establishing the transaction price used to recognize revenue. We have a high volume of performance obligations with similar characteristics, therefore we primarily use historical trends to arrive at estimated reserves. For rerate reserves, which are common for LTL carriers, we assign pricing to bills of lading at the time of shipment based primarily on the weight, general classification of the product, the shipping destination and individual customer discounts. This process is referred to as rating. At various points throughout our process, incorrect ratings could be identified based on many factors, including weight and commodity verifications. Although the majority of rerating occurs in the same month as the original rating, a portion occurs during subsequent periods. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, our financial statements included a rerate reserve as a reduction to Accounts Receivable\u201d of $7.9 million and $12.5 million, respectively.\nFor shipments in transit, we record revenue based on the percentage of service completed as of the period end and recognize delivery costs as incurred. The percentage of service completed for each shipment is based on how far along in the shipment cycle each shipment is in relation to standard transit days. Standard transit days are defined as our published service days between origin zip code and destination zip code. The total revenue earned is accumulated for all shipments in transit at a particular period end and recorded as operating revenue. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, our financial statements included deferred revenue as a reduction to Accounts Receivable\u201d of $25.2 million and $25.7 million, respectively.\nSelf-Insurance for Claims\nWe are self-insured up to certain limits for workers' compensation, third-party liability claims, and cargo loss and damage. We measure the liabilities associated with workers' compensation and third-party liability claims primarily through actuarial methods performed by an independent third-party. Actuarial methods include estimates for the undiscounted liability for claims reported, for claims incurred but not reported and for certain future administrative costs. These estimates are based on historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of costs per claim and the time required to settle claims. The effect of future inflation for costs is considered in the actuarial analysis. Actual claims may vary from these estimates due to a number of factors, including but not limited to, accident frequency and severity, claims management, changes in healthcare costs, legal and judicial developments, and overall economic conditions. We discount the actuarial calculations of claims liabilities for each calendar year to present value based on the average U.S. Treasury rate, during the calendar year of occurrence, for maturities that match the initial expected payout of the liabilities. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had $349.3 million and $350.3 million accrued for outstanding claims, respectively.\nSingle Employer Pension Plans\nEffective July 1, 2008, we froze our qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans for all participating employees not covered by collective bargaining agreements. Given the frozen status of the plans, the key estimates in determining pension cost are return on plan assets and discount rate, each of which are discussed below.\nReturn on Plan Assets\nThe assumption for expected return on plan assets represents a long-term assumption of our portfolio performance that can impact our pension expense. With $900.0 million of plan assets for the YRC Worldwide funded pension plans, a 100-basis-point decrease in the assumption for expected rate of return on assets would increase annual pension expense by approximately\n$8.6 million and would have no effect on the underfunded pension liability reflected on the balance sheet at December 31, 2019.\nWe believe our 2019 expected rate of return of 7.0% is appropriate based on our investment portfolio as well as a review of other objective indices. Although plan investments are subject to short-term market volatility, we believe they are well diversified and closely managed. Our asset allocation as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and targeted long-term asset allocation for the plans are as follows:\nTable 157: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Target\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt Securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Absolute Return\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBased on various market factors, we selected an expected rate of return on assets of 7.0% effective for the 2019 and 2018 valuations. We will continue to review our expected long-term rate of return on an annual basis and revise appropriately.\nDiscount Rate\nThe discount rate refers to the interest rate used to discount the estimated future benefit payments to their present value, also referred to as the benefit obligation. The discount rate allows us to estimate what it would cost to settle the pension obligations as of the measurement date, December 31, and impacts the following year's pension cost. We determine the discount rate by selecting a portfolio of high quality non-callable bonds with interest payments and maturities generally consistent with our expected benefit payments.\nChanges in the discount rate can significantly impact our net pension liability. However, our liability hedging strategy mitigates this impact with changes in asset returns. A 100-basis-point decrease in our discount rate would increase our underfunded pension liability by approximately $27.5 million. That same change would decrease our annual pension expense by approximately $5.4 million, driven by the return on assets. The discount rate can fluctuate considerably over periods depending on overall economic conditions that impact long-term corporate bond yields. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, we used a discount rate to determine benefit obligations of 3.56% and 4.44%, respectively.\nGains and Losses\nGains and losses occur due to changes in the amount of either the projected benefit obligation or plan assets from experience being different than assumed and from changes in assumptions. We recognize an amortization of the net gain or loss as a component of net pension cost for a year if, as of the beginning of the year, that net gain or loss exceeds ten percent of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets. If an amortization is required, it equals the amount of net gain or loss that exceeds the ten percent corridor, amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the pension plans have net losses of $406.1 million and a projected benefit obligation of $1,128.8 million. The average remaining life expectancy of plan participants is approximately 20 years. For 2020, we expect to amortize approximately $15.0 million of the net loss. The comparable amortization amounts for 2019 and 2018 were $12.8 million and $14.6 million, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2019, our plan assets included $536.2 million of investments that are measured at net asset value ( NAV\u201d) per share (or its equivalent) using the practical expedient in accordance with the fair value measurement and $44.8 million of Level 3 investments. Level 3 market values are based on inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and are significant to the fair value of the investment. These investments are subject to estimation to determine fair value which is used to determine components of our annual pension expense and the net liability.\nMulti-Employer Pension Plans\nYRC Freight, Holland, Reddaway and New Penn, contribute to 33 separate multi-employer pension plans for employees covered by our collective bargaining agreements (approximately 79% of total employees of YRC Worldwide and its subsidiaries). The pension plans provide defined benefits to retired participants.\nWe do not directly manage the multi-employer pension plans to which we contribute. Trustees, half of whom the respective union appoints and half of whom various contributing employers appoint, manage the trusts covering these plans.\nOur collective bargaining agreements with the unions determine the amount of our contributions to these plans. We recognize as net pension expense the contractually required contribution for the respective period and recognize as a liability any contributions due and unpaid.\nIn 2006, the Pension Protection Act ( PPA\u201d) became law and modified both the Code, as it applies to multi-employer pension plans and the ERISA. The Code and ERISA (in each case, as so modified) and related regulations establish minimum funding requirements for multi-employer pension plans. The funding status of these plans is determined by many factors.\nIn 2014, the Multi-Employer Pension Reform Act ( MPRA\u201d) became law which modified the ability to suspend accrued benefits of plans facing insolvency by adding a new zone status of Critical and Declining.\nIf any of our multi-employer pension plans fail to:\n \u2022 meet minimum funding requirements, \n \u2022 meet a required funding improvement or rehabilitation plan that the PPA may require for certain of our underfunded plans, \n \u2022 obtain from the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS\u201d) certain changes to or a waiver of the requirements in how the applicable plan calculates its funding levels, or \n \u2022 reduce pension benefits to a level where the requirements are met, \nwe could be required to make additional contributions to our multi-employer pension plans.\nIf any of our multi-employer pension plans enters critical status or worse and our contributions are not sufficient to satisfy any rehabilitation plan schedule, the PPA could require us to make additional surcharge contributions to the multi-employer pension plan in the amount of five to ten percent of the existing contributions required by our labor agreement for the remaining term of the labor agreement.\nIf we fail to make our required contributions to a multi-employer pension plan under a funding improvement or rehabilitation plan, it would expose us to penalties including potential withdrawal liability. If the benchmarks that an applicable funding improvement or rehabilitation plan provides for a multi-employer pension plan are not met by the end of a prescribed period, the IRS could impose an excise tax on us and the plan's other contributing employers. These excise taxes are not contributed to the deficient funds, but rather are deposited in the United States general treasury funds.\nDepending on the amount involved, a requirement to increase contributions beyond our contractually agreed rate or the imposition of an excise tax on us could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.\nFunded Status of the Multi-Employer Pension Plans and Contingent Withdrawal Liabilities\nWe received an Annual Funding Notice and, for certain plans, a Notice of Critical Status that provide an indication of the plan's financial health. The plan administrators and trustees of multi-employer pension plans do not, however, routinely provide us with detailed, current information regarding their financials. Much of our information regarding the plan financials historically has been (i) obtained from public filings using publicly available plan asset values, which are often dated, and (ii) based on the limited information available from plan administrators or trustees, which has not been independently validated.\nWe are aware that many of the multi-employer pension plans to which we contribute, including, but not limited to, the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund, Road Carriers Local 707 Pension Fund, New York State Teamsters Conference Pension and Retirement Fund, and Teamsters Local 641 Pension Fund are in critical or critical and declining status.\nBased on information obtained from public filings and from plan administrators and trustees, we believe our portion of the contingent liability in the case of a full withdrawal or termination from all of the multi-employer pension plans to which we contribute would be an estimated $8 billion on a pre-tax basis. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to payment of material withdrawal liability.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method to reflect income taxes on our financial statements. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities by applying enacted tax rates to the differences between the carrying value of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and to loss carryforwards. Tax credit carryforwards are recorded as deferred tax assets. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that the change occurs. We assess the validity of deferred tax assets and loss and tax credit carryforwards and provide valuation allowances when we determine, based on the weight of evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets, losses, or credits will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances are included in our tax provision, or in equity if directly related to other comprehensive income (loss), unless affected by a specific intraperiod allocation which happened in 2017 as described below. In determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, we evaluate factors such as prior years' earnings, loss carry-back\nand carry-forward periods, reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies that potentially enhance the likelihood of the realization of a deferred tax asset. We have not recognized deferred taxes relative to foreign subsidiaries' earnings that are deemed to be permanently reinvested. Any related taxes associated with such earnings are not material.\nYRC Worldwide applies the intraperiod tax allocation rules of ASC 740, Income Taxes ( ASC 740\u201d) to allocate income taxes among continuing operations, other comprehensive income (loss), and additional paid-in capital when our situation meets the criteria as prescribed in the rule.\nWhile the tax effect of net income (loss) before income taxes generally should be computed without regard to the tax effects of net income (loss) before income taxes from the other categories referenced in the preceding paragraph, an exception applies when there is a loss before income taxes and income from those other categories. In that situation, the appropriate tax provision is allocated to the other categories of earnings and a related tax benefit is recorded in net income (loss). This exception to the general rule applies even when a valuation allowance is in place at the beginning and end of the year. While intraperiod tax allocation does not change the overall tax provision, it may result in a gross-up of the individual components, thereby changing the amount of tax provision included in each category. In 2017, the Company met the criteria necessary to apply the exception within the intraperiod tax allocation rules, since it incurred a net loss before income taxes and income was recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). As a result, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $13.3 million in continuing operations (as reported on the statements of consolidated operations) and an offsetting tax expense of $13.3 million in total other comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2017. The total income tax benefit did not change, and the total provision continued to be impacted by the full valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets. There was no domestic deferred benefit recognized in 2019 or 2018, as the exception did not apply. This allocation has no effect on total tax provision or total valuation allowance.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d MD&A\u201d, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. See the introductory section immediately prior to Part I\u201d and Risk Factors in Item 1A\u201d of this report regarding these statements.\nOverview\nThis MD&A includes the following sections:\nOur Business: a brief description of our business and a discussion of how we assess our operating results\nConsolidated Results of Operations: an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017\nReporting Segment Results of Operations: an analysis of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 for our two reporting segments: YRC Freight and Regional Transportation\nCertain Non-GAAP Financial Measures: an analysis of our results using certain non-GAAP financial measures, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017\nLiquidity and Capital Resources: a discussion of our major sources and uses of cash as well as an analysis of our cash flows and aggregate contractual obligations and commercial commitments\nOur Business\nYRC Worldwide is a holding company that, through its operating subsidiaries, offers our customers a wide range of transportation services. YRC Worldwide has one of the largest, most comprehensive LTL networks in North America with local, regional, national and international capabilities. Through its team of experienced service professionals, YRC Worldwide offers industry-leading expertise in LTL shipments and flexible supply chain solutions, ensuring customers can ship industrial, commercial and retail goods with confidence.\nWe measure the performance of our business on both a consolidated and reporting segment basis and using several metrics, but rely primarily upon (without limitation) operating revenue, operating income (loss), and operating ratio. We also use certain non-GAAP financial measures as secondary measures to assess our operating performance.\n \u2022 Operating Revenue: Our operating revenue has two primary components: volume (commonly evaluated using tonnage, tonnage per day, number of shipments, shipments per day or weight per shipment) and yield or price (commonly evaluated using picked up revenue, revenue per hundredweight or revenue per shipment). Yield includes fuel surcharge revenue, which is common in the trucking industry and represents an amount charged to customers that adjusts with changing fuel prices. We base our fuel surcharges on the U.S. Department of Energy fuel index and adjust them weekly. Rapid material changes in the index or our cost of fuel can positively or negatively impact our revenue and operating income as a result of changes in our fuel surcharge. We believe that fuel surcharge is an accepted and important component of the overall pricing of our services to our customers. Without an industry accepted fuel surcharge program, our base pricing for our transportation services would require changes. We believe the distinction between base rates and fuel surcharge has blurred over time, and it is impractical to clearly separate all the different factors that influence the price that our customers are willing to pay. In general, under our present fuel surcharge program, we believe rising fuel costs are beneficial to us and falling fuel costs are detrimental to us in the short term, the effects of which are mitigated over time. \n \u2022 Operating Income (Loss): Operating income (loss) is operating revenue less operating expenses. Consolidated operating income (loss) includes certain corporate charges that are not allocated to our reporting segments. \n \u2022 Operating Ratio: Operating ratio is a common operating performance measure used in the trucking industry. It is calculated as (i) 100 percent (ii) minus the result of dividing operating income by operating revenue or (iii) plus the result of dividing operating loss by operating revenue, and is expressed as a percentage. \n \u2022 Non-GAAP Financial Measures: We use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures, to assess the following: \n \u25e6 EBITDA: a non-GAAP measure that reflects our earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization expense. EBITDA is used for internal management purposes as a financial measure that reflects our core operating performance. \n \u25e6 Adjusted EBITDA: a non-GAAP measure that reflects EBITDA, and further adjusts for letter of credit fees, equity-based compensation expense, net gains or losses on property disposals, restructuring charges, transaction costs related to issuances of debt, non-recurring consulting fees, non-cash impairment charges and the gains or losses from permitted dispositions, discontinued operations, and certain non-cash expenses, charges and losses (provided that if any of such non-cash expenses, charges or losses represents an accrual or reserve for potential cash items in any future period, the cash payment in respect thereof in such future period will be subtracted from Consolidated EBITDA in such future period to the extent paid). All references to Adjusted EBITDA\u201d throughout this section and the rest of this report refer to Adjusted EBITDA\u201d calculated under our New Term Loan Agreement (defined therein as Consolidated EBITDA\u201d unless otherwise specified). Consolidated EBITDA is also a defined term in our ABL Agreement and the definition there aligns with the prior definition of Consolidated EBITDA under the Prior Term Loan Agreement. Adjusted EBITDA is used for internal management purposes as a financial measure that reflects our core operating performance, to measure compliance with financial covenants in our credit facilities and to determine certain management and employee bonus compensation. \nWe believe our presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors and other users as these measures represent key supplemental information our management uses to compare and evaluate our core underlying business results both on a consolidated basis and across our business segments, particularly in light of our leverage position and the capital-intensive nature of our business. Further, EBITDA is a measure that is commonly used by other companies in our industry and provides a comparison for investors to evaluate the performance of the companies in the industry. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA helps investors to understand how the company is tracking against our financial covenant in our term loan credit agreement as this measure is calculated as defined in our term loan credit agreement and serves as a driving component of our key financial covenant.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures have the following limitations:\n \u25e6 EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or fund principal payments on our outstanding debt; \n \u25e6 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or fund principal payments on our outstanding debt, letter of credit fees, restructuring charges, transaction costs related to the issuance of debt, non-cash expenses, charges or losses (subject to the conditions above), or nonrecurring consulting fees, among other items; \n \u25e6 Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will generally need to be replaced in the future and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; \n \u25e6 Equity-based compensation is an element of our long-term incentive compensation package, although Adjusted EBITDA excludes employee equity-based compensation expense when presenting our ongoing operating performance for a particular period; and \n \u25e6 Other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, potentially limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. \nBecause of these limitations, our non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and use our non-GAAP measures as secondary measures.\nNew National Master Freight Agreement\nOn May 14, 2019, union employees at operating companies Holland, New Penn and YRC Freight ratified New NMFA, along with all supplemental agreements. The New NMFA outlines terms and conditions of employment that are customary in collective bargaining agreements and apply at a national level across the covered operations, such as wages, health benefits, multiemployer pension plan contribution rates, and various operational items. A few of the highlights in the New NMFA include:\n \u2022 Hourly wage increases in each year of the contract, beginning April 1, 2019 through 2023 \n \u2022 Health and welfare and pension contribution rate increases \n \u2022 Restoration of an additional one-week of vacation \n \u2022 The expanded ability to utilize smaller trucks that can be operated by employees who do not have a CDL \n \u2022 The ability to utilize additional hours of service, in accordance with Department of Transportation regulations \n \u2022 The increased ability to utilize purchased transportation at YRC Freight and Holland \n \u2022 The increased ability to utilize employees in non-driving positions \n \u2022 A newly-structured performance bonus program for employees \nThe new wage improvements allow us to advance our driver hiring and retention efforts to ensure we are adequately staffed with professional CDL drivers and other key personnel at our service centers. The contractual wage increases under the New NMFA that were paid retroactively to April 1, 2019 include one additional week of vacation that was retroactively applied to 2018. Additionally, the Company incurred one-time vacation charges in second quarter operating results of $12.4 million to reflect the full year 2018 and first quarter 2019 vacation benefit increase.\nThe supplemental agreements cover more localized work rules and other terms and conditions of employment. The Company was unable to commence actions to implement the operational efficiencies until the New NMFA, and all supplements, were fully ratified on May 14, 2019.\nBusiness Strategy Overview\nDuring 2019, the Company launched a multi-year enterprise transformation strategy to achieve long-term profitability and cash flow. Our strategic roadmap is built upon the proven alliance of our LTL regional and national networks, as well as our recently launched multi-mode freight brokerage solutions, to provide a broad portfolio of freight and business services to our customers.\nThe Company accomplished four foundational components during 2019:\n 1. Ratified a new five-year labor contract \n 2. Refinanced a term loan with improved and more flexible terms \n 3. Reorganized the field leadership structure to streamline decision making and enhance execution \n 4. Completed the reorganization of the enterprise-wide sales force \nLabor contract: During the first half of 2019, the Company ratified the New NMFA for the employees of Holland, New Penn and YRC Freight. The New NMFA is a critical element to the comprehensive strategic plan as it provides the Company with important changes to create a foundation for operational excellence and capacity expansion, which should lead to improved profitability. The operational changes are expected to provide efficiencies in our workforce by introducing new job classifications and allowing us to employ more flexible work rules to optimize the use of our valuable employee resources. These changes allow us to improve labor mix which should result in reduced costs per labor hour. For example, prior to the New NMFA, we were unable to fill part-time positions in many key markets across our footprint due to a non-competitive wage package for part-time employees. With the New NMFA, we have the opportunity to expand our part-time work force which allows us to reposition our commercial driver's license ( CDL\u201d) drivers to freight delivery and to deploy part-time employees to dock positions, resulting in lower employee compensation expense and improved productivity. The expansion of purchased transportation that is permitted under the New NMFA (increased to 29% of total linehaul miles for YRC Freight and introduced an 8% limit for Holland) provides us opportunities to plan and source our operations using more cost-effective resources and to expand our capacity consistent with our customer growth and engagement initiatives. The New NMFA also allows us to introduce new equipment, referred to as box trucks, into our LTL freight operations, which, along with new non-CDL driver classifications, permits us to provide a lower cost solution to local cartage or short-term rentals. Further, on September 27, 2019, the Company ratified a new two-year collective bargaining agreement for the employees of Reddaway, who were previously party to multiple bargaining agreements, and have now been combined into one collective agreement.\nCapital Structure Update: The Company announced a refinancing of its term loan obligations on September 11, 2019 and entered into a New Term Loan Agreement, which provides for additional liquidity, less restrictive financial covenants, a lower interest rate and extends the maturity of the facility to June 2024. The New Term Loan eliminates the annual principal amortization of 3.0%, which approximated $18.0 million in principal payments per year, and provides the ability to reinvest the first $40.0 million in cash proceeds earned from the sale of certain owned properties.\nEnhanced Organization Structure: Creating simplified engagement for customers and an improved service offering is a critical part of our strategic focus on growth and engagement. We completed the final phase of our sales restructuring which consolidated our four distinct sales groups into one enterprise-wide sales organization. This allows customers to buy regional, national and brokerage services from a single point of contact at YRCW while introducing existing customers to all our operating companies. The launch of our third-party brokerage solution, HNRY Logistics in late 2018, is the perfect complement to our LTL, asset-based companies and allows us to better service our customers with a full suite of logistics solutions. In addition, we implemented a new field operations structure to align with our enterprise transformation strategy to streamline decision making and enhance execution of our network enhancements\nGoing into 2020, the next phase of our transformation includes:\n 1. Operational optimization \n 2. Technology migration \n 3. Facility evaluation \nThe primary focus for the next phase of the enterprise transformation strategy is to operationally transform the movement of freight through our network and the technology used in the process. In the initial phase of our plan to optimize operations, which spanned most of 2019, two of our companies operate independently out of the same service center. Under the New NMFA that was ratified on May 14, 2019, we have the opportunity to consolidate service centers across our operating companies to optimize utilization of our assets and resources, and companies that operate in the same service territory will be serviced through one primary carrier. We believe service center consolidation presents the greatest opportunity for this initiative. We launched our first consolidation in late 2019, with the emphasis of facility evaluation occurring in 2020. By rationalizing the number of physical locations in the network while maintaining geographic coverage, we will continue to provide the same service level to our valued customers. We expect these efforts should allow us to recognize cost savings in our linehaul and pick-up and delivery operations due to improved density, increased asset utilization, and optimization of route planning and labor resources. Over time, this initiative should enhance service and strategically position our network for the growing demand of our customers and their supply chain needs, provide productivity improvements and streamline our cost structure as we seek to optimize resources across the network, in facilities, infrastructure and human capital.\nCapital investment remains a top priority for us. While ongoing investments in equipment and technology remain our primary use of operating cash flows, we understand the importance of balancing liquidity and our ongoing investments with the service and capacity we need to bring to the market. To properly execute on our transformation plan, we are committed to investing in technology in order to enhance the customer experience and improve our operational flexibilities. We intend to consolidate individual operating company systems into a single platform, with the end goal of improving profitability and the customer experience. By streamlining systems, we are providing our customers access to five brands through one network and one enterprise-wide service offering. We remain committed to investment in revenue equipment to improve the age of our fleet as there is an immediate return in improved fuel miles per gallon and reduced vehicle maintenance expense.\nSegments\nEffective January 1, 2020, the Company will realign its reportable segments as a result of an enhanced organizational structure implemented in the back half of 2019 designed to better align resources and provide greater focus on the Company's multi-year enterprise transformation strategy. The strategy is designed to improve the long-term profitability and stability of the Company, with key focus on enhancing competitive value proposition. Key elements of the enterprise transformation include operational optimization to bolster asset utilization and to leverage flexibilities gained from the new labor contract; facility evaluation to build density and create cost savings by consolidating service centers while fully protecting all brands and areas of service; and customer growth/engagement initiatives to enhance customer experience and improve our value proposition by supplying all of our service offerings and brands as one. We realigned sales to consolidate our four distinct sales groups into one enterprise sales organization. This allows customers to buy regional, national and brokerage services from a single point of contact at YRCW while introducing existing customers to additional operating companies.\nWe also implemented a new field structure to align with our enterprise transformation strategy to streamline decision making and enhance execution of our network enhancements. With the ratification of the New NMFA on May 14, 2019, the Company may now combine service centers across our operating companies to optimize utilization of our assets and resources, and the companies that operate in the same service territory will be serviced through one primary carrier.\nThe presentation of financial results as one reportable segment is consistent with the way the Company has transformed its operational leadership team under the Chief Operating Decision Maker ( CODM\u201d) where he formerly had the operating company presidents as direct reports and now has direct reports who are functional leaders whose roles span across the entire\nenterprise. Starting in 2020, the CODM will be evaluating our performance and business results, as well as making resource and operating decisions under the single segment view.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nOur consolidated results for 2019, 2018 and 2017 include the consolidated results of our reporting segments and unallocated corporate charges. A more detailed discussion of the operating results of our reporting segments is presented in the Reporting Segment Results of Operations\u201d section below.\nThe table below provides summary consolidated financial information for the three years ended December 31:\n\n(*) not meaningful\n2019 Compared to 2018\nOur consolidated operating revenue decreased $220.8 million, or 4.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018. The decrease in revenue is primarily attributed to a decrease in tonnage and fuel surcharge revenue, while partially offset by an increase in base yield excluding fuel surcharge.\nOperating expenses decreased $94.1 million, or 1.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to lower purchased transportation expense and lower fuel, operating expenses and supplies, partially offset by increased salaries, wages and employee benefits.\nSalaries, wages and employee benefits. Salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $13.7 million, or 0.5%, primarily due to a $35.5 million increase in benefits costs which was largely driven by a $25.8 increase in union vacation expense due to restoration of benefits from the passage of the New NMFA, a $15.7 million increase in workers' compensation expense, and a $6.8 million increase in salaries expense. These increases were partially offset by a $32.9 million reduction in short-term incentive compensation and an $11.3 million decrease in wages expense as a result of tonnage decreases that reduced the number of hours needed to process freight which were partially offset by contractual rate increases due to the New NMFA.\nFuel, operating expenses and supplies. Fuel, operating expenses and supplies decreased $51.2 million, or 5.4%, primarily due to a $48.1 million decrease in fuel expense, which was largely a result of lower fuel prices and fewer miles driven.\nPurchased transportation. Purchased transportation decreased $69.0 million, or 10.1%, primarily due to a $68.3 million decrease in rail and over-the-road purchased transportation expense as a result of reduced tonnage, a $9.3 million decrease from reduced usage of local purchased transportation, and a $5.9 million decrease in short-term vehicle rents. These decreases were partially offset by an $18.5 million increase in third-party costs due to the expansion in third-party logistics solutions.\nOther operating expenses. Other operating expenses decreased $7.6 million, or 3.1%, primarily due to a decrease of $4.2 million in cargo claims expense, and a $4.0 million reduction in operating taxes as a result of fewer miles driven.\nGains/losses on property disposals. Net gains on disposals of property were $13.7 million during 2019 as compared to $20.8 million in 2018. The gains in 2019 and 2018 were primarily related to the sale of real properties, including a $29.3 million gain from the sale of one excess property at YRC Freight during 2018.\nNonoperating expenses, net. Nonoperating expenses increased $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to an $11.2 million expense in 2019 related to the extinguishment of debt with no such charge in 2018, a $5.4 million increase in interest expense due to higher interest rates and outstanding debt balances during 2019, which were partially offset by a $6.3 million decrease in non-union pension costs due mainly to a reduction in non-cash pension settlement expenses.\nImpairment charges. During the first quarter of 2019, the company recorded an $8.2 million impairment charge that reflects the write-down of an intangible asset as a result of rebranding strategies, leading to the discontinued use of a tradename.\nOur effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was 4.0% and 35.5%, respectively. Significant items impacting the 2019 rate include a provision for net state and foreign taxes, certain permanent items, and a change in the valuation allowance established for the net deferred tax asset balance at December 31, 2019. We recognize valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, if, based on the weight of the evidence, we believe that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances are included in our tax provision or in equity if directly related to other comprehensive income (loss) in the period of change. In determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, we evaluate factors such as prior years' earnings history, expected future earnings, loss carry-back and carry-forward periods, reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies that potentially enhance the likelihood of the realization of a deferred tax asset. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we have a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets, exclusive of a deferred tax (asset) liability related to a foreign jurisdiction.\nIn July 2011, July 2013, and January 2014, we experienced significant changes in the ownership of our stock, as measured for Federal income tax purposes. These changes triggered the application of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the Code\u201d), which will likely have no substantial impact on the use of tax net operating loss carryovers ( NOLs\u201d) generated through January 31, 2014 and prior to offset future taxable income. While Section 382 changes may adversely affect cash flow, they have no impact on our current financial statements. The deferred tax assets resulting from the existing NOLs to which a Section 382 change applies are already fully offset by a valuation allowance.\n2018 Compared to 2017\nOur consolidated operating revenue increased $201.0 million, or 4.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The increase in revenue was largely attributed to increased base yield excluding fuel surcharge and fuel surcharge revenue, while partially offset by a decrease in tonnage.\nOperating expenses increased $177.1 million, or 3.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, due to an increase in salaries, wages and employee benefits, an increase in purchased transportation expense, and higher fuel costs, which were partially offset by an increase in gains on property disposals.\nSalaries, wages and employee benefits. Salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $65.8 million, or 2.3%, primarily due to a $49.2 million increase in employee benefit costs, which are primarily related to contractual rate increases for union employees, and a $29.8 million increase in short-term incentive compensation for employees at various levels in the organization. These increases were partially offset by a $10.9 million decrease in wages due to a decrease in shipping volumes, which required fewer employee hours to process freight.\nFuel, operating expenses and supplies. Fuel, operating expenses and supplies increased $72.7 million, or 8.4%, primarily due to a $52.7 million increase in fuel expenses driven by higher fuel prices on a per gallon basis, partially offset by fewer miles driven and improved miles per gallon. The increase in operating expenses was also due to an increase of $6.9 million in facility related expense primarily due to increased rent expense at our leased terminal locations.\nPurchased transportation. Purchased transportation increased $55.7 million, or 8.9%, primarily due to a $35.8 million increase in vehicle rent expense, mostly related to a $32.9 million increase in long-term rental expense in conjunction with the Company's leasing strategy to invest in revenue equipment. Purchased transportation expense also includes a $29.6 million increase in third-party costs due to the expansion in customer-specific logistics solutions. These increases were partially offset by a $12.2 million decrease in local purchased transportation due to reduced usage.\nOther operating expenses. Other operating expenses increased $3.1 million, or 1.3%, primarily due to an increase of $8.1 million in our third-party liability claims expense primarily due to current year claims, partially offset by a $4.6 million decrease in cargo claims expense.\nGains/losses on property disposals. Net gains on disposals of property were $20.8 million in 2018 compared to net gains of $0.6 million in 2017. The gains in 2018 were primarily related to the sale of real properties, including a $29.3 million gain from the sale of an excess property at YRC Freight.\nNonoperating expenses, net. Nonoperating expenses decreased $25.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to an $11.2 million decrease in net periodic pension cost. Additionally, in 2017 we incurred $8.1 million in transaction costs related to debt amendments with no corresponding expense in 2018.\nOur effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was 35.5% and 40.3%, respectively. Significant items impacting the 2018 rate include a provision for net state and foreign taxes, foreign withholding taxes related to dividends from a foreign subsidiary, certain permanent items, and a change in the valuation allowance established for the net deferred tax asset balance at December 31, 2018. Significant items impacting the 2017 rate include a benefit recognized due to application of the exception to the rules regarding intraperiod tax allocation, a provision for net state and foreign taxes, certain permanent items,\nand a change in the valuation allowance established for the net deferred tax asset balance at December 31, 2017. We recognize valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, if, based on the weight of the evidence, we believe that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances are included in our tax provision or in equity if directly related to other comprehensive income (loss) in the period of change. In determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, we evaluate factors such as prior years' earnings history, expected future earnings, loss carry-back and carry-forward periods, reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies that potentially enhance the likelihood of the realization of a deferred tax asset. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we have a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets, exclusive of a deferred tax liability related to a foreign jurisdiction.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) was enacted in the U.S. on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act reduced the US federal corporate income tax rate to 21% from 35%, required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and created new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings. The Company adopted the guidance provided by Securities and Exchange Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d) regarding the public disclosures of certain accounting impacts of the Tax Act. In 2017 and the first nine months of 2018, the Company recorded provisional amounts for certain enactment date effects by applying the guidance in SAB 118 because we had not yet completed our enactment date accounting for these effects. All provisional amounts were finalized for the 2018 Form 10-K as required by SAB 118. This includes the federal and state income tax effects of newly enacted one-time transition tax. Such finalization had no net impact on the tax provision for 2018, as it merely adjusted net operating loss carry-forward amounts and was fully offset by a valuation allowance.\nReporting Segment Results of Operations\nWe evaluate our business using our two reporting segments:\n \u2022 YRC Freight is the reporting segment that focuses on longer haul business opportunities with national, regional and international services. YRC Freight provides for the movement of industrial, commercial and retail goods. This reporting segment includes YRC Freight, our LTL subsidiary, YRC Freight Canada, a subsidiary located in Canada that specializes in shipments into, across and out of Canada, and HNRY Logistics, our logistics solutions provider. In addition to the United States and Canada, YRC Freight also serves parts of Mexico and Puerto Rico. \n \u2022 Regional Transportation is the reporting segment for our transportation service providers focused on business opportunities in the regional and next-day delivery markets. Regional Transportation is comprised of Holland, New Penn and Reddaway. These companies each provide regional, next-day ground services in their respective regions through a network of facilities located across the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico. \nYRC Freight Results\nYRC Freight represented 63% of our consolidated operating revenue in 2019, 2018 and 2017. The table below provides summary financial information for YRC Freight for the years ended December 31:\n\n (a) pp represents the change in percentage points \n2019 Compared to 2018\nYRC Freight reported operating revenue of $3,088.7 million in 2019, a decrease of $108.6 million, or 3.4%, compared to 2018. The decrease in revenue was largely driven by a decrease in tonnage and fuel surcharge revenue, while partially offset by an increase in base LTL yield excluding fuel surcharge. The table below summarizes the key revenue metrics for the YRC Freight reporting segment for the years ended December 31:\n\n\n (a) Does not equal financial statement revenue due to revenue adjustments for shipments in transit and the impact of other revenue. \n (b) Percent change based on unrounded figures and not rounded figures presented. \nOperating income for YRC Freight was $38.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $46.7 million from the same period in 2018. Operating expenses decreased $61.9 million primarily due to decreases in purchased transportation expense and fuel, operating expenses and supplies. These decreases were partially offset by increased salaries, wages and employee benefits.\nSalaries, wages and employee benefits. Salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $7.2 million, or 0.4%, primarily due to a $21.9 million increase in benefits costs which was largely driven by a $16.8 million increase in union vacation expense due to restoration of benefits from the passage of the New NMFA, and a $2.9 million increase in salaries expense. These increases were partially offset by a $9.0 million decrease in wage expense as a result of a decrease in tonnage that reduced the number of hours needed to process freight, which was partially offset by contractual rate increases as a result of the New NMFA, as well as an $8.2 million reduction in short-term incentive compensation.\nFuel, operating expenses and supplies. Fuel, operating expenses and supplies decreased $42.9 million, or 7.2%, primarily due to a $28.7 million decrease in fuel expenses driven by lower fuel prices on a per gallon basis, fewer miles driven and improved miles per gallon. Also, professional fees decreased by $9.2 million primarily due to decreased management fees of corporate and other enterprise-wide shared services and other corporate service fees and consulting fees.\nPurchased Transportation. Purchased transportation decreased $49.7 million, or 9.3%, primarily due to a $49.8 million decrease in rail and over-the-road purchased transportation expense as a result of reduced shipping volumes, an $11.1 million\ndecrease from reduced usage of local purchased transportation, and a $5.5 million decrease in short-term vehicle rents. These decreases were partially offset by an $18.5 million increase in third-party costs due to the expansion in customer-specific logistics solutions.\nGains/losses on property disposals. Net gains on disposals of property were $9.8 million during 2019 as compared to $20.2 million in 2018. The gains in 2019 and 2018 were primarily related to the sale of real properties, including a $29.3 million gain from the sale of one excess property during 2018.\nImpairment charges. During the first quarter of 2019, the company recorded an $8.2 million impairment charge that reflects the write-down of an intangible asset as a result of rebranding strategies, leading to the discontinued use of a tradename.\n2018 Compared to 2017\nYRC Freight reported operating revenue of $3,197.3 million in 2018, an increase of $129.4 million, or 4.2%, compared to 2017. The increase in revenue was largely driven by an increase in base yield excluding fuel surcharge and fuel surcharge revenue, partially offset by a decrease in tonnage. The table below summarizes the key revenue metrics for the YRC Freight reporting segment for the years ended December 31:\n\n\n (a) Does not equal financial statement revenue due to revenue adjustments for shipments in transit and the impact of other revenue. \n (b) Percent change based on unrounded figures and not rounded figures presented. \nOperating income for YRC Freight was $85.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $24.3 million from the same period in 2017. Operating expenses increased $105.1 million primarily due to an increase in salaries, wages and employee benefits, an increase in purchased transportation expense, and higher fuel costs, which were partially offset by an increase in gains on property disposals.\nSalaries, wages and employee benefits. Salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $21.3 million, or 1.2%, primarily due to a $33.0 million increase in employee benefit costs, which are primarily related to contractual rate increases for union employees, and a $6.1 million increase in short-term incentive compensation for employees at various levels in the organization. These increases were partially offset by an $11.7 million decrease in wages due to a decrease in shipping volumes, which required fewer employee hours to process freight. Additionally, workers' compensation expense decreased $6.1 million mainly due to favorable development on prior year claims.\nFuel, operating expenses and supplies. Fuel, operating expenses and supplies increased $51.7 million, or 9.5%, primarily due to a $26.2 million increase in fuel expenses driven by higher fuel prices on a per gallon basis, partially offset by fewer miles driven and improved miles per gallon. Also, professional fees increased by $21.0 million primarily due to increased management fees and other corporate service fees and non-recurring consulting fees.\nPurchased Transportation. Purchased transportation increased $55.0 million, or 11.5%, primarily due to a $33.5 million increase in vehicle rent expense of which $30.6 million was attributable to long-term rentals in conjunction with the Company's leasing strategy to invest in revenue equipment. Purchased transportation expense also includes a $29.6 million increase in third-party costs due to the expansion in customer-specific logistics solutions. These costs were partially offset by an $11.3 million decrease from reduced usage of local purchased transportation.\nOther operating expenses. Other operating expenses decreased $2.1 million, or 1.4%, primarily due to a $6.1 million decrease in cargo claims expense, partially offset by an increase of $4.1 million in our third-party liability claims expense primarily due to current year claims.\nGains/losses on property disposals. Net gains on disposals of property were $20.2 million in 2018 compared to net gains of $2.2 million in 2017, primarily due to the sale of real properties. The 2018 gain includes a $29.3 million gain on the sale of an excess property.\nRegional Transportation Results\nRegional Transportation represented 37% of consolidated operating revenue in 2019, 2018 and 2017. The table below provides summary financial information for Regional Transportation for the years ended December 31:\n\n (a) pp represents the change in percentage points \n2019 Compared to 2018\nRegional Transportation reported operating revenue of $1,782.7 million for 2019, representing a decrease of $112.3 million, or 5.9%, from 2018. The decrease in revenue is primarily attributed to a decrease in tonnage and fuel surcharge, partially offset by an improvement in base yield, excluding fuel surcharge. The table below summarizes the key revenue metrics for the Regional Transportation reporting segment for the years ended December 31:\n\n\n (a) Does not equal financial statement revenue due to revenue adjustments for shipments in transit. \n (b) Percent change based on unrounded figures and not rounded figures presented. \nOperating loss for Regional Transportation was $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $75.5 million from operating income of $70.7 million for the same period in 2018. Operating expenses decreased $36.8 million primarily due to a decrease in purchased transportation expense and fuel, operating expenses and supplies. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in salaries, wages and employee benefits.\nSalaries, wages and employee benefits. Salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $17.9 million, or 1.6%, primarily due to a $15.5 million increase in workers' compensation expense and a $13.8 million increase in employee benefits costs which was largely driven by an $9.0 million increase in union vacation expense due to restoration of benefits from the passage of the New NMFA. These increases were partially offset by an $8.3 million reduction in short-term incentive compensation and a $2.5 million decrease in wage expense as a result of a decrease in tonnage that reduced the number of hours needed to process freight, which was partially offset by contractual rate increases as a result of the New NMFA.\nFuel, operating expenses and supplies. Fuel, operating expenses and supplies decreased $22.6 million, or 5.7%, primarily due to a $19.4 million decrease in fuel expense, which was largely driven by fewer miles driven and lower prices.\nOther operating expenses. Other operating expenses decreased $7.6 million, or 7.7%, primarily due to a decrease of $6.9 million in our third-party liability claims expense primarily due to the favorable development of prior-year claims.\nGains/losses on property disposals. Net gains on disposals of property were $5.3 million during 2019 as compared to $0.6 million in 2018. The gains in 2019 and 2018 were primarily related to the sale of real properties.\n2018 Compared to 2017\nRegional Transportation reported operating revenue of $1,895.0 million for 2018, representing an increase of $71.6 million, or 3.9%, from 2017. The increase in revenue was largely driven by an increase in base yield excluding fuel surcharge and fuel surcharge revenue, partially offset by a decrease in tonnage. The table below summarizes the key revenue metrics for the Regional Transportation reporting segment for the years ended December 31:\n\n\n (a) Does not equal financial statement revenue due to revenue adjustments for shipments in transit. \n (b) Percent change based on unrounded figures and not rounded figures presented. \nOperating income for Regional Transportation was $70.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $2.8 million from the same period in 2017. Operating expenses increased $68.8 million primarily due to higher fuel costs, an increase in contractual wages and employee benefit costs, and an increase in vehicle maintenance expense.\nSalaries, wages and employee benefits. Salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $20.0 million, or 1.8%, primarily due to a $14.3 million increase in employee benefit costs, which are primarily related to contractual rate increases for union employees, and a $6.6 million increase in short-term incentive compensation for employees at various levels in the organization. These increases were partially offset by a $4.1 million decrease in workers' compensation expense mainly due to favorable development on prior year claims.\nFuel, operating expenses and supplies. Fuel, operating expenses and supplies increased $43.1 million, or 12.2%, primarily due to a $26.5 million increase in fuel expenses driven by higher fuel prices on a per gallon basis, partially offset by fewer miles driven. Additionally, vehicle maintenance expense increased $8.2 million primarily due to the timing of revenue equipment additions, and professional fees increased $3.8 million due to increased management and other corporate service fees.\nOther operating expenses. Other operating expenses increased $5.1 million, or 5.4%, primarily due to an increase of $3.9 million increase in our third-party liability claims expense primarily due to current year claims and a $1.5 million increase in cargo claims expense.\nCertain Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAs discussed in the Our Business\u201d section, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures to assess performance. These measures should be considered in addition to the results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, our GAAP financial measures. For segment Adjusted EBITDA, we present the reconciliation from operating income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA as it is consistent with how we measure performance.\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA\nThe reconciliation of net income (loss) to EBITDA and EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA (defined in our New Term Loan Agreement as Consolidated EBITDA\u201d) for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:\n\n (a) Certain reclassifications and adjustments have been made to prior years to conform to the new calculation and presentation of Adjusted EBITDA furnished in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on September 11, 2019. \n (b) Non-cash reserve changes reflect the net non-cash reserve charge for union and nonunion vacation (which includes the impact of the New NMFA for the one week of restored vacation), with such non-cash reserve adjustment to be reduced by cash charges in a future period when paid. \n (c) Pursuant to the New Term Loan Agreement, Adjusted EBITDA limits certain adjustments in aggregate to 10% of the trailing-twelve-month (\"TTM\") consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, prior to the inclusion of amounts subject to the 10% threshold, for each period ending. Such adjustments include, but are not limited to, restructuring charges, integration costs, severance, and non-recurring charges. The limitation calculation is updated quarterly based on TTM Adjusted EBITDA, and any necessary adjustment resulting from this limitation, if applicable, will be presented here. \nSegment Adjusted EBITDA\nThe following represents Adjusted EBITDA by segment for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:\n\nThe reconciliation of operating income (loss), by segment, to Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:\n\n\n\n (a) Certain reclassifications and adjustments have been made to prior years to conform to the new calculation and presentation of Adjusted EBITDA furnished in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on September 11, 2019. \n (b) Non-cash reserve changes reflect the net non-cash reserve charge for union and non-union vacation (which includes the impact of the New NMFA for the one week of restored vacation), with such non-cash reserve adjustment to be reduced by cash charges in a future period when paid. \n (c) Pursuant to the New Term Loan Agreement, Adjusted EBITDA limits certain adjustments in aggregate to 10% of the trailing-twelve-month (\"TTM\") consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, prior to the inclusion of amounts subject to the 10% threshold, for each period ending. Such adjustments include, but are not limited to, restructuring charges, integration costs, severance, and non-recurring charges. The limitation calculation is updated quarterly based on TTM Adjusted EBITDA, and any necessary adjustment resulting from this limitation, if applicable, will be presented here. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, available borrowings under our ABL Facility and any prospective net cash flow from operations. As of December 31, 2019, our maximum availability under our ABL Facility was $37.7 million, and our managed accessibility is $0.2 million. Maximum availability is derived by reducing the amount that may be advanced against eligible receivables plus eligible borrowing base cash by certain reserves imposed by the ABL Agent and our $337.8 million of outstanding letters of credit. Our Managed Accessibility of $0.2 million represents the maximum amount we would access on the ABL Facility and is adjusted for eligible receivables plus eligible borrowing base cash measured as of December 31, 2019. If eligible receivables fall below the threshold management uses to measure availability, which is 10% of the borrowing line, the credit agreement governing the ABL Facility permits adjustments from eligible borrowing base cash to restricted cash prior to the compliance measurement date of January 15, 2020. As of January 15, 2020, we had less than 10% of the borrowing line in eligible receivables and moved $29.0 million of cash into restricted cash, as permitted under the ABL Facility, which effectively put our cash and cash equivalents and Managed Accessibility to $80.4 million as of December 31, 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our availability under our ABL Facility was $39.2 million. Of the $39.2 million in availability, Managed Accessibility was $1.2 million. Our cash and cash equivalents and Managed Accessibility was $203.8 million as of December 31, 2018.\nThe table below summarizes cash and cash equivalents and Managed Accessibility for the years ended December 31:\n\nOutside of funding normal operations, our principal uses of cash include making contributions to our various multi-employer pension funds and single-employer pension plans, and meeting our other cash obligations, including, but not limited to, paying principal and interest on our funded debt, payments on equipment leases and investments in capital expenditures.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our Standard & Poor's Corporate Family Rating was B-\u201d with a stable outlook and Moody's Investor Service Corporate Family Rating was B2\u201d with a positive outlook.\nCredit Facility Covenants\nThe New Term Loan Agreement includes a financial covenant requirement for the Company to maintain a minimum of $200.0 million trailing-twelve-month Adjusted EBITDA, measured quarterly. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, defined in our New Term Loan Agreement as Consolidated EBITDA,\u201d is a measure that reflects our earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization expense, and is further adjusted for, among other things, letter of credit fees, equity-based compensation expense, net gains or losses on property disposals, restructuring charges, transaction costs related to issuances of debt, non-recurring consulting fees, non-cash impairment charges, integration costs, severance, non-recurring charges and the gains or losses from permitted dispositions, discontinued operations, and certain non-cash expenses, charges and losses (provided that if any of such non-cash expenses, charges or losses represents an accrual or reserve for potential cash items in any future period, the cash payment in respect thereof in such future period will be subtracted from Consolidated EBITDA in such future period to the extent paid). The definition was further modified under the New Term Loan Agreement such that certain expenses that qualify as adjustments are capped at 10.0% of the trailing-twelve-month Adjusted EBITDA. Adjustments subject to the 10.0% cap include, but are not limited to, restructuring charges, integration costs, severance, and non-recurring charges. Additionally, all net gains from the disposition of properties are excluded from the definition of Adjusted EBITDA, therefore any gains previously recognized in Adjusted EBITDA, as that term was previously defined in our SEC filings prior to our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2019, in accordance with its definition in the Prior Term Loan Agreement, will not be included in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA under the New Term Loan Agreement. Further, for all years presented in this Annual Form 10-K, the presentation of adjusted EBITDA has been updated to reflect this new definition. Our trailing twelve month Adjusted EBITDA as of December 31, 2019 was $210.6 million.\nThe ABL Facility also contains certain affirmative and negative covenants with which we must comply.\nRisks and Uncertainties Regarding Compliance with Credit Facility Financial Covenants\nUnder the New Term Loan, we are required to maintain at least $200.0 million in Adjusted EBITDA on a TTM basis measured each quarter until maturity (June 2024). For the TTM period ended December 31, 2019, we achieved Adjusted EBITDA of $210.6 million. We believe that our results of operations will allow us to comply with the minimum Adjusted EBITDA covenant for at least the next twelve months. Our ability to comply is subject to a more stable and robust freight environment and continued actions and cost savings initiatives we began in the fourth quarter of 2019 and continue today. These actions and initiatives include headcount reductions commensurate with our current volume levels, a hiring freeze on new and replacement positions, temporary elimination of short-term incentive compensation, and a reduction in discretionary spend.\nWe began taking these actions because of the freight recession our industry experienced in 2019, and that has persisted into early first quarter 2020, that negatively impacted our ability to fully realize operational efficiencies arising from our New NMFA with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters primarily due to the ensuing depressed volume levels and the inherent contractual cost increase associated with the New NMFA. Our ability to satisfy our liquidity needs and meet our minimum Adjusted EBITDA requirement during the next twelve months and thereafter is dependent upon our ability to improve operating performance over 2019 to offset the contractual wage and benefit increases under the New NMFA and other inflationary expense increases associated with among other things our employees and insurance programs.\nWe may extend and or supplement the actions we began taking in 2019 if we continue to experience adverse conditions such as lower volumes, pricing, yield or lower productivities among others, that might impact our forecasted performance. If we are unable to achieve the results required to comply with this covenant in one or more quarters over the next twelve months, we may be required to take specific actions in addition to those described above, including but not limited to, additional reductions in headcount and targeted procurement initiatives to reduce operating costs and, or alternatively, seek a waiver or an amendment from our lenders. Obtaining a waiver or an amendment is not within our control, and if unsuccessful, the lenders may exercise the rights available to them under the New Term Loan.\nCash Flow\nOperating Cash Flow\nCash flow from operations decreased by $203.3 million to $21.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $224.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in cash flow is primarily related to a $124.2 million decrease in net income, and the remaining difference is primarily related to timing differences in working capital accounts.\nCash flow from operations increased by $164.1 million to $224.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $60.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in cash flow is primarily related to $55.2 million in changes to accounts receivables from an improvement in days sales outstanding, and a $52.8 million decrease in minimum cash contributions for the non-union pension plans. Cash provided by operations also improved due to a $31.0 million increase in net income.\nInvesting Cash Flow\nCash used in investing activities was $117.3 million in 2019 compared to $109.0 million in 2018, primarily due to a net decrease in proceeds from the disposal of property and equipment of $10.5 million.\nCash used in investing activities was $109.0 million in 2018 compared to $94.5 million in 2017, primarily due to an increase in acquisition costs for revenue equipment. Partially offsetting this increase, net proceeds from the disposal of property and equipment increased $27.6 million mainly due to the sale of real properties.\nSee a detailed discussion of 2019 and 2018 capital expenditures below in Capital Expenditures\u201d for further information.\nFinancing Cash Flow\nNet cash used in financing activities for 2019 was $22.6 million, which consists primarily of $579.0 million in repayments of our long-term debt, offset by the issuance of $570.0 million of long-term debt for the New Term Loan, in addition to $12.7 million in deferred debt issuance costs incurred.\nNet cash used in financing activities for 2018 was $33.9 million, which consists primarily of $31.9 million in repayments of our long-term debt.\nNet cash used in financing activities for 2017 was $96.2 million, which consists primarily of $79.3 million in repayments of our long-term debt, of which $61.9 million was in addition to regularly scheduled principal payments, as well as $14.5 million in debt issuance costs incurred during the year related to our financing transactions.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur capital expenditures focus primarily on the replacement of revenue equipment, investments in information technology and improvements to land and structures. Our business is capital intensive with significant investments in tractors, trailers, refurbished engines, and service center facilities. We determine the amount and timing of capital expenditures based on numerous factors, including fleet age, service center condition, viability of IT systems, anticipated liquidity levels, economic conditions, new or expanded services, regulatory actions and availability of financing.\nThe table below summarizes our actual net capital expenditures (proceeds) by type of investment for the years ended December 31:\n\nOur capital expenditures for revenue equipment were used primarily to fund the purchase of tractors, trailers and containers and to refurbish engines for our revenue fleet.\nWe also acquire our equipment through operating leases which will vary based on anticipated liquidity and lease financing options.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we entered into new operating lease commitments for revenue equipment totaling $111.0 million, with such payments to be made over an average lease term of 4 years with a capital equivalent value of $131.8 million. As of December 31, 2019, our operating lease obligations through 2030 totaled 451.1 million and are expected to increase as we lease additional revenue equipment in future years.\nContractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments\nThe following sections provide aggregated information regarding our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2019.\nNon-Union Pension Obligations\nWe provide defined benefit pension plans for certain employees not covered by collective bargaining agreements. The qualified plans, which include the Yellow Corporation Pension Plan, the Roadway LLC Pension Plan and the YRC Retirement Pension Plan (collectively held in the YRC Worldwide Inc. Master Pension Plans Trust or Trust\u201d) cover approximately 9,000 employees including those currently receiving benefits and those who have left the company with deferred benefits. On January 1, 2004, the existing qualified benefit plans were closed to new participants. On July 1, 2008, the benefit accrual for participants was frozen.\nIn 2015, we adopted the legislative changes provided by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 ( BBA 2015\u201d) which was signed into law on November 2, 2015. This legislation extends the use of longer-term, stabilized interest rate assumptions for measuring pension obligations under the minimum funding requirements. We expect to make the plan contributions as required by BBA 2015 and other regulations.\nDuring 2017, the Company amended the domestic qualified pension plans to provide for an automatic commencement of benefit at age 65, regardless of employment status. Also during 2017, the Yellow Transportation Plan was amended to permit the payment of lump sum benefit payments for those participants who reached age 65. Additionally, the Yellow Transportation Plan was amended to permit the payment of lump sum benefit payments effective January 1, 2018. These amendments are consistent with the Company's continued long-term strategy of de-risking the qualified pension plans.\nDuring 2019, our net pension expense was $2.6 million. This amount included a $1.8 million expense recognition of settlements from lump sum payouts during the year. The non-cash settlement charge is reflected in nonoperating expenses as a result of the requirement to expense the unrecognized actuarial losses associated with the lump sum settlements. Our cash contributions were $9.7 million. Using our current plan assumptions, which include an assumed 7.0% return on assets and a discount rate of 3.56%, we expect to record income of $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nWe expect cash contributions for our non-union sponsored pension plans for the next five years to be as follows:\n\nOur investment strategy for our pension assets and our related pension contribution funding obligation includes an active interest rate hedging program designed to mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates on each plan's funded position. If the pension discount rate falls, our investment strategy is designed to significantly mitigate such interest rate risk to each pension plan's funded status and our contribution funding obligation. Conversely, if the pension discount rate rises, some portion of the beneficial impact of a rising discount rate on the pension liability will be forgone. The investment program is dynamic and the hedging program is designed to adapt to market conditions.\nIf future actual asset returns fall short of the 7.0% assumption by 1.0% per year, total cash contributions would be $6.3 million higher over the next five years. If future actual asset returns exceed the 7.0% assumption by 1.0% per year, total cash contributions would be $6.4 million lower over the next five years.\nIf future interest rates decrease 100 basis points from January 1, 2020 levels, total cash contributions would be $34.9 million lower over the next five years. This reflects our liability hedging strategy and the impact of BBA 2015 legislation. The liability hedging strategy results in additional asset returns from decreases in interest rates. However, BBA 2015 limits the increase in liabilities from lower interest rates such that the net effect is lower contributions. If interest rates increase 100 basis points from January 1, 2020 levels, total cash contributions would be $40.3 million higher over the next five years.\nContractual Cash Obligations\nThe following table reflects cash outflows that we are contractually obligated to make as of December 31, 2019:\n\n (a) The ABL Facility includes future payments for the letter of credit fees and unused line fees and are not included on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. \n (b) The Term Loan includes principal and interest payments, but excludes the unamortized discounts. \n (c) The lease financing obligations consist primarily of interest payments. \n (d) Pension deferral obligations includes principal and interest payments on the Second A&R CDA. \n (e) The workers' compensation and third-party liability claims obligations represent our estimate of future payments for these obligations, not all of which are contractually required. \n (f) Operating leases represent future payments, which include interest, under contractual lease arrangements primarily for revenue equipment. \n (g) Other contractual obligations includes future service agreements and certain maintenance agreements and are not included on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. \n (h) Capital expenditure obligations primarily includes noncancelable orders for revenue equipment leases not yet delivered, whereby the cash obligations will be scheduled over the multi-year term of the lease and ROU assets and liabilities will be recorded upon lease execution. \nOther Commercial Commitments\nThe following table reflects other commercial commitments or potential cash outflows that may result from a contingent event, such as a need to borrow short-term funds due to insufficient cash flow.\n\n (a) Availability under the ABL Facility is derived by reducing the amount that may be advanced against eligible receivables plus eligible borrowing base cash by certain reserves imposed by the ABL Agent and our outstanding letters of credit. \n (b) Letters of credit outstanding are generally required as collateral to support self-insurance programs and do not represent additional liabilities as the underlying self-insurance accruals are already included in our consolidated balance sheets. \n (c) Surety bonds are generally required for workers' compensation to support self-insurance programs, which include certain bonds that do not have an expiration date but are redeemable on demand, and do not represent additional liabilities as the underlying self-insurance accruals are already included in our consolidated balance sheets. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements except for other contractual obligations for service agreements and capital purchases, letters of credit and surety bonds, which are reflected in the above tables.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nPreparation of our financial statements requires accounting policies that involve significant estimates and judgments regarding the amounts included in the financial statements and disclosed in the accompanying notes to the financial statements. We continually review the appropriateness of our accounting policies and the accuracy of our estimates including discussion with the Audit & Ethics Committee of our Board of Directors who make recommendations to management regarding these policies. Even with a thorough process, estimates must be adjusted based on changing circumstances and new information. Management has identified the policies described below as requiring significant judgment and having a potential material impact to our financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition and Revenue-related Reserves\nThe Company's revenues are derived from the transportation services we provide through the delivery of goods over the duration of a shipment. Upon receipt of the bill of lading, the contract existence criteria is met as evidenced by a legally enforceable agreement between two parties where collectability is probable, thus creating the distinct performance obligation. The Company has elected to expense initial direct costs as incurred because the average shipment cycle is less than one week.\nThe YRC Freight and Regional Transportation segments recognize revenue and substantially all the purchased transportation expense on a gross basis because we direct the use of the transportation service provided and remain responsible for the complete and proper shipment.\nInherent within our revenue recognition practices are estimates for revenue associated with shipments in transit and future adjustments to revenue and accounts receivable for billing adjustments and collectability.\nWe record an allowance for doubtful accounts primarily based on historical uncollectible amounts. We also take into account known factors surrounding specific customers and overall collection trends. For the reserve for uncollectible accounts, we primarily use historical write-off experience but may also consider customer-specific factors, overall collection trends and economic conditions as part of our ongoing monitoring of credit. Our process involves performing ongoing credit evaluations of customers, including the market in which they operate and the overall economic conditions. We continually review historical trends and customer specific factors and make adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts as appropriate. Our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled $11.4 million and $11.1 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nGiven the nature of our transportation services, future adjustments may arise which creates variability when establishing the transaction price used to recognize revenue. We have a high volume of performance obligations with similar characteristics, therefore we primarily use historical trends to arrive at estimated reserves. For rerate reserves, which are common for LTL carriers, we assign pricing to bills of lading at the time of shipment based primarily on the weight, general classification of the product, the shipping destination and individual customer discounts. This process is referred to as rating. At various points throughout our process, incorrect ratings could be identified based on many factors, including weight and commodity verifications. Although the majority of rerating occurs in the same month as the original rating, a portion occurs during subsequent periods. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, our financial statements included a rerate reserve as a reduction to Accounts Receivable\u201d of $7.9 million and $12.5 million, respectively.\nFor shipments in transit, we record revenue based on the percentage of service completed as of the period end and recognize delivery costs as incurred. The percentage of service completed for each shipment is based on how far along in the shipment cycle each shipment is in relation to standard transit days. Standard transit days are defined as our published service days between origin zip code and destination zip code. The total revenue earned is accumulated for all shipments in transit at a particular period end and recorded as operating revenue. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, our financial statements included deferred revenue as a reduction to Accounts Receivable\u201d of $25.2 million and $25.7 million, respectively.\nSelf-Insurance for Claims\nWe are self-insured up to certain limits for workers' compensation, third-party liability claims, and cargo loss and damage. We measure the liabilities associated with workers' compensation and third-party liability claims primarily through actuarial methods performed by an independent third-party. Actuarial methods include estimates for the undiscounted liability for claims reported, for claims incurred but not reported and for certain future administrative costs. These estimates are based on historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of costs per claim and the time required to settle claims. The effect of future inflation for costs is considered in the actuarial analysis. Actual claims may vary from these estimates due to a number of factors, including but not limited to, accident frequency and severity, claims management, changes in healthcare costs, legal and judicial developments, and overall economic conditions. We discount the actuarial calculations of claims liabilities for each calendar year to present value based on the average U.S. Treasury rate, during the calendar year of occurrence, for maturities that match the initial expected payout of the liabilities. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had $349.3 million and $350.3 million accrued for outstanding claims, respectively.\nSingle Employer Pension Plans\nEffective July 1, 2008, we froze our qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans for all participating employees not covered by collective bargaining agreements. Given the frozen status of the plans, the key estimates in determining pension cost are return on plan assets and discount rate, each of which are discussed below.\nReturn on Plan Assets\nThe assumption for expected return on plan assets represents a long-term assumption of our portfolio performance that can impact our pension expense. With $900.0 million of plan assets for the YRC Worldwide funded pension plans, a 100-basis-point decrease in the assumption for expected rate of return on assets would increase annual pension expense by approximately\n$8.6 million and would have no effect on the underfunded pension liability reflected on the balance sheet at December 31, 2019.\nWe believe our 2019 expected rate of return of 7.0% is appropriate based on our investment portfolio as well as a review of other objective indices. Although plan investments are subject to short-term market volatility, we believe they are well diversified and closely managed. Our asset allocation as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and targeted long-term asset allocation for the plans are as follows:\n\nBased on various market factors, we selected an expected rate of return on assets of 7.0% effective for the 2019 and 2018 valuations. We will continue to review our expected long-term rate of return on an annual basis and revise appropriately.\nDiscount Rate\nThe discount rate refers to the interest rate used to discount the estimated future benefit payments to their present value, also referred to as the benefit obligation. The discount rate allows us to estimate what it would cost to settle the pension obligations as of the measurement date, December 31, and impacts the following year's pension cost. We determine the discount rate by selecting a portfolio of high quality non-callable bonds with interest payments and maturities generally consistent with our expected benefit payments.\nChanges in the discount rate can significantly impact our net pension liability. However, our liability hedging strategy mitigates this impact with changes in asset returns. A 100-basis-point decrease in our discount rate would increase our underfunded pension liability by approximately $27.5 million. That same change would decrease our annual pension expense by approximately $5.4 million, driven by the return on assets. The discount rate can fluctuate considerably over periods depending on overall economic conditions that impact long-term corporate bond yields. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, we used a discount rate to determine benefit obligations of 3.56% and 4.44%, respectively.\nGains and Losses\nGains and losses occur due to changes in the amount of either the projected benefit obligation or plan assets from experience being different than assumed and from changes in assumptions. We recognize an amortization of the net gain or loss as a component of net pension cost for a year if, as of the beginning of the year, that net gain or loss exceeds ten percent of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets. If an amortization is required, it equals the amount of net gain or loss that exceeds the ten percent corridor, amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the pension plans have net losses of $406.1 million and a projected benefit obligation of $1,128.8 million. The average remaining life expectancy of plan participants is approximately 20 years. For 2020, we expect to amortize approximately $15.0 million of the net loss. The comparable amortization amounts for 2019 and 2018 were $12.8 million and $14.6 million, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2019, our plan assets included $536.2 million of investments that are measured at net asset value ( NAV\u201d) per share (or its equivalent) using the practical expedient in accordance with the fair value measurement and $44.8 million of Level 3 investments. Level 3 market values are based on inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and are significant to the fair value of the investment. These investments are subject to estimation to determine fair value which is used to determine components of our annual pension expense and the net liability.\nMulti-Employer Pension Plans\nYRC Freight, Holland, Reddaway and New Penn, contribute to 33 separate multi-employer pension plans for employees covered by our collective bargaining agreements (approximately 79% of total employees of YRC Worldwide and its subsidiaries). The pension plans provide defined benefits to retired participants.\nWe do not directly manage the multi-employer pension plans to which we contribute. Trustees, half of whom the respective union appoints and half of whom various contributing employers appoint, manage the trusts covering these plans.\nOur collective bargaining agreements with the unions determine the amount of our contributions to these plans. We recognize as net pension expense the contractually required contribution for the respective period and recognize as a liability any contributions due and unpaid.\nIn 2006, the Pension Protection Act ( PPA\u201d) became law and modified both the Code, as it applies to multi-employer pension plans and the ERISA. The Code and ERISA (in each case, as so modified) and related regulations establish minimum funding requirements for multi-employer pension plans. The funding status of these plans is determined by many factors.\nIn 2014, the Multi-Employer Pension Reform Act ( MPRA\u201d) became law which modified the ability to suspend accrued benefits of plans facing insolvency by adding a new zone status of Critical and Declining.\nIf any of our multi-employer pension plans fail to:\n \u2022 meet minimum funding requirements, \n \u2022 meet a required funding improvement or rehabilitation plan that the PPA may require for certain of our underfunded plans, \n \u2022 obtain from the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS\u201d) certain changes to or a waiver of the requirements in how the applicable plan calculates its funding levels, or \n \u2022 reduce pension benefits to a level where the requirements are met, \nwe could be required to make additional contributions to our multi-employer pension plans.\nIf any of our multi-employer pension plans enters critical status or worse and our contributions are not sufficient to satisfy any rehabilitation plan schedule, the PPA could require us to make additional surcharge contributions to the multi-employer pension plan in the amount of five to ten percent of the existing contributions required by our labor agreement for the remaining term of the labor agreement.\nIf we fail to make our required contributions to a multi-employer pension plan under a funding improvement or rehabilitation plan, it would expose us to penalties including potential withdrawal liability. If the benchmarks that an applicable funding improvement or rehabilitation plan provides for a multi-employer pension plan are not met by the end of a prescribed period, the IRS could impose an excise tax on us and the plan's other contributing employers. These excise taxes are not contributed to the deficient funds, but rather are deposited in the United States general treasury funds.\nDepending on the amount involved, a requirement to increase contributions beyond our contractually agreed rate or the imposition of an excise tax on us could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.\nFunded Status of the Multi-Employer Pension Plans and Contingent Withdrawal Liabilities\nWe received an Annual Funding Notice and, for certain plans, a Notice of Critical Status that provide an indication of the plan's financial health. The plan administrators and trustees of multi-employer pension plans do not, however, routinely provide us with detailed, current information regarding their financials. Much of our information regarding the plan financials historically has been (i) obtained from public filings using publicly available plan asset values, which are often dated, and (ii) based on the limited information available from plan administrators or trustees, which has not been independently validated.\nWe are aware that many of the multi-employer pension plans to which we contribute, including, but not limited to, the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund, Road Carriers Local 707 Pension Fund, New York State Teamsters Conference Pension and Retirement Fund, and Teamsters Local 641 Pension Fund are in critical or critical and declining status.\nBased on information obtained from public filings and from plan administrators and trustees, we believe our portion of the contingent liability in the case of a full withdrawal or termination from all of the multi-employer pension plans to which we contribute would be an estimated $8 billion on a pre-tax basis. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to payment of material withdrawal liability.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method to reflect income taxes on our financial statements. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities by applying enacted tax rates to the differences between the carrying value of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and to loss carryforwards. Tax credit carryforwards are recorded as deferred tax assets. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that the change occurs. We assess the validity of deferred tax assets and loss and tax credit carryforwards and provide valuation allowances when we determine, based on the weight of evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets, losses, or credits will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances are included in our tax provision, or in equity if directly related to other comprehensive income (loss), unless affected by a specific intraperiod allocation which happened in 2017 as described below. In determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, we evaluate factors such as prior years' earnings, loss carry-back\nand carry-forward periods, reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies that potentially enhance the likelihood of the realization of a deferred tax asset. We have not recognized deferred taxes relative to foreign subsidiaries' earnings that are deemed to be permanently reinvested. Any related taxes associated with such earnings are not material.\nYRC Worldwide applies the intraperiod tax allocation rules of ASC 740, Income Taxes ( ASC 740\u201d) to allocate income taxes among continuing operations, other comprehensive income (loss), and additional paid-in capital when our situation meets the criteria as prescribed in the rule.\nWhile the tax effect of net income (loss) before income taxes generally should be computed without regard to the tax effects of net income (loss) before income taxes from the other categories referenced in the preceding paragraph, an exception applies when there is a loss before income taxes and income from those other categories. In that situation, the appropriate tax provision is allocated to the other categories of earnings and a related tax benefit is recorded in net income (loss). This exception to the general rule applies even when a valuation allowance is in place at the beginning and end of the year. While intraperiod tax allocation does not change the overall tax provision, it may result in a gross-up of the individual components, thereby changing the amount of tax provision included in each category. In 2017, the Company met the criteria necessary to apply the exception within the intraperiod tax allocation rules, since it incurred a net loss before income taxes and income was recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). As a result, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $13.3 million in continuing operations (as reported on the statements of consolidated operations) and an offsetting tax expense of $13.3 million in total other comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2017. The total income tax benefit did not change, and the total provision continued to be impacted by the full valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets. There was no domestic deferred benefit recognized in 2019 or 2018, as the exception did not apply. This allocation has no effect on total tax provision or total valuation allowance.", "item_7_tables": "Table 107: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

forward-looking statements subject to risks outlined in prior sections. It covers the company's business overview, consolidated and segment results, non-GAAP financial measures, liquidity, capital resources, new labor agreements, and business strategy.\n\nThe business overview describes YRC Worldwide as a holding company offering extensive transportation services, with a focus on Less-Than-Truckload (LTL) networks in North America. The company assesses performance using operating revenue, income (loss), ratio, and non-GAAP measures such as EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.\n\nConsolidated results for 2019 show a decrease in operating revenue and net income (loss) compared to 2018, primarily due to reduced tonnage and fuel surcharge revenue, partially offset by yield increases. Nonoperating expenses increased mainly due to debt extinguishment expenses. The effective tax rate changed significantly due to valuation allowances on deferred tax assets.\n\nReporting segment results split between YRC Freight and Regional Transportation reveal decreased revenues and operating incomes for 2019, attributed to the decline in tonnage and fuel surcharge revenues, despite yield improvements.\n\nNon-GAAP measures, such as Adjusted EBITDA, are important for internal performance assessment, compliance with financial covenants, and executive compensation. These measures exclude certain expenses and gains/losses on property disposals.\n\nThe company ratified new labor contracts leading to wage increases and various operational benefits, which support driver hiring and retention.\n\nThe business strategy focuses on long-term profitability through network optimization, technology migration, and facility evaluation. This involves consolidating sales groups, leveraging new logistics solutions, and optimizing operations with the goal of improving service and reducing costs.\n\nFor liquidity and capital resources, the company discusses major sources and uses of cash, the credit facility covenant to maintain minimum Adjusted EBITDA, and potential risk factors that could affect financial covenants.\n\nDetails about contractual obligations and commercial commitments are provided, including amounts related to pension obligations, leases, and other liabilities.\n\nFinally, critical accounting policies such as revenue recognition, self-insurance for claims, accounting for income taxes, and pension plans are explained, highlighting the underlying estimates and judgments that could materially impact financial statements."}
