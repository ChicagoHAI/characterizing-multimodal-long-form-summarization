MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons. See the factors set forth under the heading Forward Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of Part 1 of this Annual Report and in Item 1(A) under the heading Risk Factors.\u201d The following discussion is qualified in its entirety by, and should be read in conjunction with, the more detailed information contained in Item 6 Selected Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.\nOverview\nWe are a leading global operator of regulated exchanges, clearing houses and listings venues, and a provider of data services for commodity, financial, fixed income and equity markets. We operate regulated marketplaces for listing, trading and clearing of a broad array of derivatives contracts and securities across major asset classes, including energy and agricultural commodities, metals, interest rates, equities, ETFs, credit derivatives, bonds and currencies. We also offer comprehensive data services to support the trading, investment, risk management and connectivity needs of customers around the world and across asset classes.\nOur exchanges include derivative exchanges in the U.S., U.K., EU, Canada and Singapore, and cash equities, equity options and bond exchanges in the U.S. We also operate OTC markets for physical energy, fixed income and CDS trade execution. To serve global derivatives markets, we operate central counterparty, or CCP, clearing houses in the U.S., U.K., EU, Canada and Singapore. We offer a range of data services for global financial and commodity markets, including pricing and reference data, exchange data, analytics, feeds, index services, desktops and connectivity solutions. Through our markets, clearing houses, listings and data services, we provide comprehensive solutions for our customers through liquid markets, benchmark products, access to capital markets and related services to support their ability to manage risk and raise capital. Our business is currently conducted as two reportable business segments, our Trading and Clearing segment and our Data and Listings segment, and the majority of our identifiable assets are located in the U.S., U.K. and Canada.\nRecent Developments\nU.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or TCJA\nIn December 2017, the TCJA was signed into law. It reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. Many of the tax provisions under the TCJA became effective January 1, 2018, including the new rate and complex international tax provisions. Given the complexity of these international provisions and certain potential unintended consequences that are under debate at both the federal and state level, certain federal and state guidance has been issued and further guidance is anticipated, but the likelihood and timing of such guidance remains uncertain. See - Consolidated Income Tax Provision\u201d below.\nAcquisitions\nOn January 2, 2018, we acquired BondPoint from Virtu Financial, Inc. for $400 million in cash. BondPoint is a provider of electronic fixed income trading solutions for the buy-side and sell-side, offering access to centralized liquidity and automated trade execution services through its ATS and provides trading services to more than 500 financial services firms.\nOn July 18, 2018, we acquired CHX Holdings, Inc., the parent company of CHX, a full-service stock exchange, including trading, data and corporate listings services. CHX operates as a registered national securities exchange.\nOn July 23, 2018, we acquired TMC Bonds for $700 million in cash. The cash consideration is gross of $15 million cash held by TMC Bonds on the date of acquisition. TMC Bonds is an electronic fixed income marketplace, supporting anonymous trading across multiple protocols in various asset classes, including municipals, corporates, treasuries, agencies and certificates of deposit.\nOn October 3, 2018, we completed the purchase of the remaining equity interests in MERS and accordingly now have 100% ownership. On that date, we gained control of MERS, now part of ICE Mortgage Services, began to include its results as\npart of our consolidated operations, and recorded a $110 million gain on our initial investment value as other non-operating income.\nLaunch of Bakkt\nOn December 19, 2018, we and non-ICE limited partners funded the newly-formed entity, Bakkt, LLC, or Bakkt. Bakkt was formed to create an integrated platform that enables consumers and institutions to transact in digital assets. The Bakkt ecosystem is designed to include regulated trading, clearing and custodial solutions for digital assets, which will be supported by ICE Futures U.S. and ICE Clear U.S. The first traded contract targeted for launch will be a Bakkt Bitcoin physically delivered daily futures contract to provide price discovery. The custodial solution will establish new protocols for managing the specific security and settlement requirements of digital currencies. In addition, there will be a separate guaranty fund. It is also expected that Bakkt will offer additional solutions to expand the range of uses for digital assets.\nInvestment in Euroclear\nDuring 2017, we purchased a 4.7% stake in Euroclear valued at \u20ac276 million in cash ($327 million). Upon purchasing this stake, we agreed to participate on the Euroclear Board of Directors. During the same period, we negotiated an additional purchase which closed on February 21, 2018, following regulatory approval. This provided us with an additional 5.1% stake in Euroclear for a purchase price of \u20ac246 million in cash ($304 million). As of December 31, 2018, we own a 9.8% stake in Euroclear for a total investment of $631 million. Euroclear is a provider of post-trade services, including settlement, central securities depositories and related services for cross-border transactions across asset classes. Refer to Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for more information.\nPurchase of Non-Controlling Interests\nFor consolidated subsidiaries in which our ownership is less than 100% and for which we have control over the assets, liabilities and management of the entity, the outside stockholders' interests are shown as non-controlling interest in our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2017, non-controlling interest consisted of the operating results of our CDS clearing subsidiaries in which non-ICE limited partners held a 29.9% ownership interest. During September 2018, we purchased a 3.2% ownership interest from a non-ICE limited partner and the remaining other limited partners hold a 26.7% ownership interest as of December 31, 2018.\nConsolidated Financial Highlights\nThe following summarizes our results and significant changes in our consolidated financial performance for the periods presented (dollars in millions, except

Market liquidity is one of the primary market attributes for attracting and maintaining customers and is an important indicator of a market's strength. In addition, the ability to evolve existing products to serve emerging needs, develop new products and respond to competitive dynamics in pricing, exclusivity and consolidation is important to our business.\nRecent changes with regard to global financial reform have emphasized the importance of transparent markets, centralized clearing and access to data, all of which are important aspects of our product offering. However, some of the proposed rules have yet to be implemented and some rules that have already been partially implemented are being reconsidered. In addition, some of the global regulations have not been fully harmonized and several of the MiFID II regulations are inconsistent with U.S. rules. As the evolution continues, legislative and regulatory actions may change the way we conduct our business and may create uncertainty for market participants, which could affect trading volumes or demand for market data. As a result, it is difficult to predict all of the effects that the legislation and its implementing regulations will have on us. As discussed more fully in Item 1 - Business - Regulation\u201d included in this Annual Report, Brexit, the implementation of MiFID II and other regulations may result in operational, regulatory and/or business risk.\nIn recent years, low interest rates and uncertainty in the financial markets continued to reflect the impact of a relatively slow economic recovery. Lower growth in Asia and the EU may also continue to affect global financial markets. In addition, economic and regulatory uncertainty, coupled with periods of high market volatility around geopolitical events, low interest rates and low natural gas prices, has affected our clients' activities in recent years. The duration of these trends will determine the continued impact on our business.\nWe have diversified our business so that we are not dependent on volatility or trading activity in any one asset class. In addition, we have increased our portion of non-transaction and clearing revenues from 39% in 2014 to 56% in 2018. This non-transaction revenue includes data services and listings.\nMany of the data products we sell and services we provide are required for our clients' business operations regardless of market volatility or shifts in business profitability levels. We anticipate that there will continue to be growth in the financial information services sector driven by a number of global trends, including the following:\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>increasing global regulatory demands;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>greater use of fair value accounting standards and reliance on independent valuations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>greater emphasis on risk management;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>market fragmentation driven by regulatory changes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 183: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the move to passive investing and indexation;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 184: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>ongoing growth in the size and diversity of financial markets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 185: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>increased automation of fixed income and other less automated markets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the development of new data products;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 187: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the demand for greater data capacity and connectivity;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 188: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>new entrants; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>increasing demand for outsourced services by financial institutions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We continue to focus on our strategy to grow each of our revenue streams, as well as on our company-wide expense reduction initiatives and our synergies in connection with our acquisitions in order to mitigate these uncertainties and to build on our growth opportunities by leveraging our proprietary data, clearing and markets.\nSegment Results\nOur business is conducted through two reportable business segments:\nTable 190: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Trading and Clearing, which comprises our transaction-based execution and clearing businesses; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 191: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Data and Listings, which comprises our subscription-based data services and securities listings businesses.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> While revenues are recorded specifically in the segment in which they are earned or to which they relate, a significant portion of our operating expenses are not solely related to a specific segment because the expenses serve functions that are necessary for the operation of both segments. We use a pro-rata revenue approach as the allocation method for the expenses that do not relate solely to one segment. Further, we did not allocate expenses to specific revenue streams within these segments since such an allocation is not reasonably possible. Our two segments do not engage in intersegment transactions.\nTrading and Clearing Segment\nThe following presents selected statements of income data for our Trading and Clearing segment (dollars in millions):\n(1) The adjusted numbers in the charts above are calculated by excluding items that are not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance.

reported on a net basis, except for the NYSE transaction-based expenses discussed below, and consist of fees collected from our derivatives, fixed income, cash equities and equity options trading and derivatives clearing. In our derivatives markets, we earn transaction and clearing revenues from both counterparties to each contract that is traded and/or cleared, and in our equity and equity options markets, we receive trade execution fees as well as routing fees related to orders in our markets which are routed to other markets for execution.\nRates per-contract, or RPC, are driven by the number of contracts or securities traded and the fees charged per contract, net of certain rebates. Our per-contract transaction and clearing revenues will depend upon many factors, including, but not limited to, market conditions, transaction and clearing volume, product mix, pricing, applicable revenue sharing and market making agreements, and new product introductions. Because transaction and clearing revenues are generally assessed on a per-contract basis, revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume and due to product mix.\nIn 2018, 2017 and 2016, 20%, 20% and 19%, respectively, of our Trading and Clearing segment revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were billed in pounds sterling or euros. Due to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro over the last two years compared to the U.S. dollar, our Trading and Clearing segment revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were higher by $18 million in 2018 from 2017, and were lower by $14 million in 2017 from 2016.\nOur transaction and clearing revenues are presented net of rebates. We recorded rebates of $844 million, $749 million and $674 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We offer rebates in certain of our markets primarily to support market liquidity and trading volume by providing qualified participants in those markets a discount to the applicable commission rate. Such rebates are calculated based on volumes traded. The increase in the rebates is due primarily to an increase in the number of participants in the rebate programs offered on various contracts, an increase in our traded volume and an increase in the number of rebate programs.\nTable 193: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Energy Futures and Options Contracts: Total energy volume and revenues increased 1% and 6%, respectively, in 2018 from 2017, and increased 8% and 5%, respectively, in 2017 from 2016. Revenues increased in 2018 from 2017 due to a higher mix of gasoil, emissions and TTF gas volumes, which have a higher average RPC than other energy products.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Total oil volume increased 3% in 2018 from 2017, and increased 14% in 2017 from 2016. ICE Brent crude futures and options volume was flat in 2018 from 2017, and increased 15% in 2017 from 2016. ICE WTI crude futures and options volume increased 5% in 2018 from 2017, and increased 14% in 2017 from 2016. The volume increases were primarily due to increased oil price volatility related to shifting supply and demand dynamics globally; broader market volatility in oil products, equities and foreign exchange rates; acts of central governments; outcomes of elections; and uncertainty around the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, policy. Our record gasoil futures and options volume in 2018 increased 11% from 2017, and increased 13% in 2017 from 2016. Gasoil futures and options increased during 2018 and 2017 primarily due to increased demand for distillates, strong economic activity in Europe and Asia and regulatory uncertainty.\nOur global natural gas futures and options volume decreased 4% in 2018 from 2017, and decreased 1% in 2017 from 2016. The volume decrease in 2018 from 2017 was primarily due to lower U.S. price volatility reducing our commercial customers' need to hedge the Henry Hub contract, and depressed gas prices driven by a continued surplus of natural gas during 2018 as compared to 2017. Our 2018 Henry Hub natural gas volume decrease was partially offset by increased volumes in our North American basis market and TTF gas in Europe. Our record TTF gas volumes in 2018 were driven by changing natural gas dynamics due to the continued globalization of natural gas. Emission futures and options volumes increased 73% in 2018 from 2017, and increased 1% in 2017 from 2016. Our record emissions volumes in 2018 were driven by higher carbon prices and supply-demand dynamics impacted by regulatory uncertainty.\nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Agricultural and Metals Futures and Options Contracts: Total volume and revenues in our agricultural and metals futures and options markets increased 15% and 16%, respectively, in 2018 from 2017, and decreased 7% and 5%, respectively, in 2017 from 2016. Volume in our largest agricultural contract, sugar futures and options, increased 20% in 2018 from 2017, and decreased 10% in 2017 from 2016. Other agricultural and metal futures and options volume increased 11% in 2018 from 2017, and decreased 4% in 2017 from 2016. The increases in agricultural volumes to record levels in 2018 were primarily driven by price volatility resulting from shifting supply and demand dynamics. The decreases in agricultural volume in 2017 were primarily driven by the reduced price volatility in 2017 compared to the higher price volatility in 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 195: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Financial Futures and Options Contracts: Interest rates futures and options volume and revenue increased 14% and 19%, respectively, in 2018 from 2017, and increased 27% and 9%, respectively, in 2017 from 2016. Our record level interest rate futures and options volume in 2018 was driven by expectations for heightened central bank activity during 2018, coupled with geopolitical uncertainty in the U.K. and Europe.

The decrease was primarily due to the termination of our exclusive license to list futures and options contracts on the Russell\u00ae indices. Excluding the futures and options contracts on the Russell\u00ae indices, other financial futures and options volume increased 18% in 2018 from 2017.

Cash equities handled volume decreased 17% in 2017 from 2016, primarily due to reduced U.S. equities market volatility during 2017 as compared to 2016. Cash equities revenues, net of transaction-based expenses, were $220 million, $196 million, and $223 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nEquity options volume increased 43% in 2018 from 2017 primarily due to heightened volatility in the U.S. equity markets, as well as increased market share in 2018 due to greater volatility. Equity options volume decreased 13% in 2017 from 2016 primarily due to lower U.S. equity market volatility and the restructuring of the NYSE American Options business. Equity options revenues, net of transaction-based expenses, were $107 million, $90 million and $98 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Fixed Income and Credit: CDS clearing revenues were $139 million, $113 million and $107 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Buy-side participation at our U.S. CDS clearing house, ICE Clear Credit, reached record levels in terms of number of participants and notional cleared due to increased participation from both U.S. and European buy-side customers due to greater regulatory certainty, depth of liquidity, the breadth of products offered, and cost efficient margining in the U.S. relative to Europe.

crossing session activity internally matched on our exchanges or routed to and executed on an external market center. Matched volume represents the total number of shares of equity securities, ETFs and crossing session activity executed on our exchanges.\nFor NYSE cash equities, market share increased in 2018 due to increased equity market volatility, the commencement of trading on NYSE National and the acquisition of CHX. NYSE cash equities market share declined during 2017 due to historically low volatility driving more trading to off-exchange trading venues, particularly dark-pools. For NYSE equity options, 2018 market share improved due to greater equity market volatility and decreased in 2017 due to a strategic focus on maximizing revenues in an extremely competitive environment.\nTransaction-Based Expenses\nOur equities and equity options markets pay fees to the SEC pursuant to Section 31 of the Exchange Act. Section 31 fees are recorded on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue. These Section 31 fees are assessed to recover the government's costs of supervising and regulating the securities markets and professionals. We, in turn, collect corresponding activity assessment fees from member organizations clearing or settling trades on the equities and options exchanges, and recognize these amounts in our transaction and clearing revenues when invoiced. The activity assessment fees are designed to equal the Section 31 fees. As a result, activity assessment fees and the corresponding Section 31 fees do not have an impact on our net income, although the timing of payment by us may vary from collections. The fees we collect are included in cash at the time of receipt and we remit the amounts to the SEC semi-annually as required. The total amount is included in accrued liabilities and was $105 million as of December 31, 2018.\nWe make liquidity payments to cash and options trading customers, as well as routing charges made to other exchanges included in transaction-based expenses. We incur routing charges when we do not have the best bid or offer in the market for a security that a customer is trying to buy or sell on one of our securities exchanges. In that case, we route the customer's order to the external market center that displays the best bid or offer. The external market center charges us a fee per share (denominated in tenths of a cent per share) for routing to its system. We record routing charges on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue.\nOperating Expenses, Operating Income and Operating Margin\nOur Trading and Clearing segment operating expenses increased $130 million in 2018 from 2017, and decreased $45 million in 2017 from 2016, partially related to the $33 million Creditex customer relationship intangible asset impairment expense recorded in 2016. See - Consolidated Operating Expenses\u201d below for a discussion of the significant changes in our operating expenses. Our Trading and Clearing segment operating income increased $162 million in 2018 from 2017, and increased $71 million in 2017 from 2016. Trading and Clearing segment operating margins were 62%, 63% and 61% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The operating income increases in the last two years were driven by the revenue increases discussed above.\nOur Trading and Clearing segment adjusted operating expenses were $824 million, $714 million and $716 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our Trading and Clearing segment adjusted operating income was $1.6 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.4 billion in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our Trading and Clearing segment adjusted operating margins were 66% in 2018, 2017 and 2016.

Through ICE Data Services, we generate revenues from a range of global financial and commodity markets, including pricing and reference data, exchange data, analytics, feeds, index services, desktops and connectivity solutions. Through NYSE, NYSE American and NYSE Arca, we generate listings revenue related to the provision of listings services for public companies and ETFs, and related corporate actions for listed companies.\nIn 2018, 2017 and 2016, 8%, 10% and 12%, respectively, of our Data and Listings segment revenues were billed in pounds sterling or euros (all relating to our data services revenues). As the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the U.S. equivalent of revenues denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly. Due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar compared to the pound sterling and euro during 2018, our data services revenues were higher by $7 million in 2018 than in 2017. Due to the weakening of the pound sterling and euro compared to the U.S. dollar during 2017, our data services revenues were lower by $8 million in 2017 than in 2016.\nOur data services revenues are primarily subscription-based and increased 1% in 2018 from 2017, and increased 5% in 2017 from 2016. The increases in revenues in both 2018 and 2017 were primarily due to the strong retention rate of\nexisting customers, the addition of new customers, increased purchases by existing customers and increases in pricing of our products, partially offset by the divestitures of IDMS in March 2017 and Trayport in December 2017 within our desktop and connectivity business. The increase in revenue in 2017 from 2016 was also partially due to our acquisitions of TMX Atrium in May 2017 and BofAML's Global Research division's index business in October 2017 and the impact of foreign currency translation.\nTable 206: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Pricing and Analytics: Our pricing and analytics revenues increased 7% in 2018 from 2017 and increased 13% in 2017 from 2016.

ASV does not include new sales, contract terminations or price changes that may occur during that 12-month period. ASV also does not include certain data services revenue streams that are not subscription-based. Revenue from ASV businesses has historically represented approximately 90% of our data revenues. Thus, while it is an indicative forward-looking metric, it does not provide a growth forecast of the next 12 months of data services revenues.\nAs of December 31, 2018, ASV was $1.922 billion, which increased 6.1% compared to the ASV as of December 31, 2017. This does not adjust for year-over-year foreign exchange fluctuations or impacts of acquisitions. Underpinning this growth is strength in our pricing & analytics business.\nListings Revenues\nListings revenues in our securities markets arise from fees applicable to companies listed on our cash equities exchanges - original listing fees and annual listing fees. Original listing fees consist of two components: initial listing fees and fees related to corporate actions. Initial listing fees, subject to a minimum and maximum amount, are based on the number of shares that a company initially lists. All listings fees are billed upfront and the identified performance obligations are satisfied over time. Revenue related to the investor relations performance obligation is recognized ratably over a two-year period, with the remaining revenue recognized ratably over time as customers continue to list on our exchanges, which is generally estimated to be over a period of up to nine years for NYSE and up to five years for NYSE Arca and NYSE American.\nIn addition, we earn corporate actions-related listing fees in connection with actions involving the issuance of new shares, such as stock splits, rights issues and sales of additional securities, as well as mergers and acquisitions. Listings fees related to other corporate actions are considered contract modifications of our listing contracts and are recognized ratably over time as customers continue to list on our exchanges, which is generally estimated to be a period of six years for NYSE and three years for NYSE Arca and NYSE American.\nOur listings revenues increased 4% in 2018 from 2017 and decreased 1% in 2017 from 2016 due to changes in market conditions for IPOs.\nOperating Expenses, Operating Income and Operating Margin\nOur Data and Listings segment operating expenses increased $7 million in 2018 from 2017, and decreased $36 million in 2017 from 2016. See - Consolidated Operating Expenses\u201d below for a discussion of the significant changes in our operating expenses. Our Data and Listings segment operating income increased $42 million in 2018 from 2017, and increased $136 million in 2017 from 2016. Our Data and Listings segment operating margins were 42%, 41% and 37% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The operating income and operating margin increases during 2018 and 2017 were driven by the revenue increases discussed above.\nOur Data and Listings segment adjusted operating expenses were $1.2 billion in 2018, 2017 and 2016. Our Data and Listings segment adjusted operating income was $1.3 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our Data and Listings segment adjusted operating margins were 51%, 51% and 49% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. See - Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below.\nConsolidated Operating Expenses\nThe following presents our consolidated operating expenses (dollars in millions):\nTable 209: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Compensation and benefits\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>946\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>946\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>953\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional services\n</td> <td>131\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>137\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition-related transaction and integration costs\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(56\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Technology and communication\n</td> <td>432\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>397\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>397\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rent and occupancy\n</td> <td>68\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>586\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>535\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>535\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>610\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe majority of our operating expenses do not vary directly with changes in our volume and revenues, except for certain technology and communication expenses and a portion of our compensation expense that is tied directly to our data sales or overall financial performance.\nWe expect our operating expenses to increase in absolute terms in future periods in connection with our acquisitions and growth of our business, and to vary from year-to-year based on the type and level of our acquisitions, our integrations and other investments.\nIn 2018, 2017 and 2016, 13%, 14% and 18%, respectively, of our operating expenses were incurred in pounds sterling or euros. Due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar compared to the pound sterling and euro in 2018, our consolidated operating expenses were higher by $12 million in 2018 than in 2017. Due to the weakening of the pound sterling and euro as compared to the U.S. dollar in 2017, our consolidated operating expenses were lower by $14 million in 2017 than in 2016. See Item 7(A) - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\u201d below for additional information.\nCompensation and Benefits Expenses\nCompensation and benefits expense is our most significant operating expense and includes non-capitalized employee wages, bonuses, non-cash or stock compensation, certain severance costs, benefits and employer taxes. The bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on both our financial performance and the individual employee performance. The performance-based restricted stock compensation expense is also based on our financial performance. Therefore, our compensation and benefits expense will vary year-to-year based on our financial performance and fluctuations in the number of employees.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had 5,161 employees, compared to 4,952 and 5,631 as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Our employee headcount increased in 2018 from 2017 primarily due to new employees related to the acquisitions of BondPoint in January 2018, CHX Holdings, Inc. and TMC Bonds in July 2018 and MERS in October 2018, partially offset by continued employee terminations associated with our integration of Interactive Data. Our employee headcount decreased in 2017 from 2016 primarily due to the divestitures in 2017 of IDMS, Trayport and NYSE Governance Services, and employee terminations in connection with our integration of Interactive Data, partially offset by new employees related to the acquisitions of ICE NGX and TMX Atrium in 2017. See - Recent Developments\u201d above.\nOur compensation and benefits expenses increased in 2018 from 2017 primarily due to employee severance and retention costs and a net increase in our employee headcount, partially offset by a decrease in non-cash compensation expense. We incurred employee severance and retention costs of $41 million, $21 million and $10 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in compensation and benefits expenses in 2017 from 2016 was minimal.\nNon-cash compensation expenses recognized in our consolidated financial statements for employee stock options and restricted stock were $130 million, $135 million and $123 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in non-cash compensation expenses in 2018 from 2017 was primarily related to a change in ICE's non-cash incentive plans that reduced the overall amount of non-cash incentives awarded. The increase in non-cash compensation expenses in 2017 from 2016 primarily relates to the integration of the Interactive Data employees into the ICE non-cash incentive plans.\nProfessional Services Expenses\nThis expense includes fees for consulting services received on strategic and technology initiatives, temporary labor, as well as regulatory, legal and accounting fees, and may fluctuate as a result of changes in consulting and technology services, temporary labor, and regulatory, accounting and legal proceedings.\nProfessional services expenses increased in 2018 from 2017 primarily due to consulting and legal fees related to software development consulting costs. Professional services expenses decreased in 2017 from 2016 primarily due to the continued reduction in professional services and contractors at NYSE. We eliminated or replaced certain contractor positions with full-time employees at NYSE in 2016. In addition, during 2016, we recorded a credit from a third-party service provider related to fees charged in a prior period. Legal fees, which are included in professional services expenses, primarily related to class action lawsuits in which NYSE was a defendant. These decreases were partially offset by professional services expenses incurred by Interactive Data, Trayport, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis.\nAcquisition-Related Transaction and Integration Costs\nIn 2018, we incurred $34 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, primarily relating to employee terminations and lease terminations in connection with our our integrations of Interactive Data, Securities Evaluations and\nCredit Market Analysis, professional services costs from our 2018 acquisitions, and a $5 million banker success fee in connection with our acquisition of TMC Bonds. The integration of Interactive Data was completed by June 30, 2018.\nIn 2017, we incurred $36 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, primarily relating to our integrations of Interactive Data, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis and our acquisitions of BondPoint, TMX Atrium, the ICE BofAML Indices and NYSE National. Of this amount, $11 million was primarily related to the acquisitions. We incurred $25 million for Interactive Data, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis integration costs relating to employee and lease termination costs and professional services costs.\nIn 2016, we incurred $80 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs primarily relating to our integrations of Interactive Data and NYSE, legal and professional fees related to the Trayport CMA review, our investment in MERS, our acquisitions of Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis, and various other potential and discontinued acquisitions. Of this amount, $41 million was primarily related to the acquisitions and other transaction costs. We incurred $39 million for Interactive Data and NYSE integration costs during 2016, primarily relating to employee and lease termination costs and professional services costs. The integration of NYSE was completed in 2016 and no NYSE integration costs were incurred after 2016.\nWe expect to continue to explore and pursue various potential acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our competitive position and support our growth. As a result, we may incur acquisition-related transaction costs in future periods. See - Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below.\nTechnology and Communication Expenses\nTechnology support services consist of costs for running our wholly-owned data centers, hosting costs paid to third-party data centers, and maintenance of our computer hardware and software required to support our technology and cybersecurity. These costs are driven by system capacity, functionality and redundancy requirements. Communication expenses consist of costs for network connection for our electronic platforms, telecommunications costs, and fees paid for access to external market data. This expense also includes licensing and other fee agreement expenses which may be impacted by growth in electronic contract volume, our capacity requirements, changes in the number of telecommunications hubs and connections with customers to access our electronic platforms directly.\nTechnology and communications expenses increased in 2018 from 2017, primarily due to $17 million in data center migrations, hardware support upgrades and cybersecurity investments, $11 million in increased costs related to our recent acquisitions, net of divestitures, and $7 million in increased costs for external market data content acquisition and revenue share agreements related to our product offering. Technology and communications expenses increased in 2017 from 2016, primarily due to $14 million in increased hardware support upgrades and cybersecurity investments, and $10 million in costs related to our recent acquisitions, net of divestitures.\nRent and Occupancy Expenses\nRent and occupancy expense relates to leased and owned property and includes rent, maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities and other related costs. We have significant operations located in and around Atlanta, New York and London with smaller offices located throughout the world. See Item 2 - Properties\u201d above for additional information regarding our leased and owned property.\nExcluding the impact of the acquisitions, rent and occupancy expenses decreased the last two years primarily due to reduced rent and occupancy costs realized from the continued consolidation of our Atlanta, New York and London office locations.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include marketing, advertising, public relations, insurance, bank service charges, dues and subscriptions, travel and entertainment, non-income taxes and other general and administrative costs.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased in 2018 from 2017, primarily due to $14 million in accruals relating to SEC investigations and inquiries made during 2017. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased in 2017 from 2016, primarily due to the acquisitions of Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis and $14 million in accruals relating to SEC investigations and inquiries. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and the SEC investigations and inquiries, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased the last two years primarily due to lower marketing expenses. Refer to Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for more information on the SEC investigations and inquiries.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses\nDepreciation and amortization expense results from depreciation of long-lived assets such as buildings, leasehold improvements, planes, furniture, fixtures and equipment over their estimated useful lives. This expense includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our acquisitions of businesses, as well as on various licensing agreements, over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of customer relationships, trading products with finite lives and technology. This expense also includes amortization of internally-developed and purchased software over its estimated useful life.\nWe recorded amortization expenses on intangible assets acquired as part of our acquisitions, as well as on other intangible assets, of $289 million, $272 million and $323 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Amortization expense increased in 2018 from 2017, as a result of ICE NGX, BondPoint, TMC Bonds, the ICE BofAML Indices, MERS and TMX Atrium intangible assets. In addition, in 2018, we recorded a $4 million impairment loss on exchange registration intangible assets related to our closure of ICE Futures Canada and ICE Clear Canada as amortization expense. This increase in amortization expense was partially offset by a decrease in amortization recorded on our Russell license intangible assets in 2018 from 2017 due to these assets becoming fully amortized, and amortization expense recorded in 2017 as a result of the net loss of $6 million on the sale of NYSE Governance Services.\nThe decrease in the amortization expenses recorded on the intangible assets in 2017 from 2016 is primarily due to a reduction in amortization expenses recorded on intangible assets which became fully amortized (primarily related to certain of the NYSE intangible assets) and the divestitures of Trayport and NYSE Governance Services, partially offset by amortization expenses recorded on the Securities Evaluations, Credit Market Analysis, ICE NGX and TMX Atrium intangible assets. In 2016, we recorded an impairment of the Creditex customer relationship intangible asset of $33 million, which was recorded in depreciation and amortization expenses. In 2016, we sold certain of Creditex's U.S. voice brokerage operations to Tullett Prebon and discontinued Creditex's U.K. voice brokerage operations. We continue to operate Creditex's electronically traded markets and systems, post-trade connectivity platforms and intellectual property.\nWe recorded depreciation expenses on our fixed assets of $293 million, $257 million and $254 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, with the increase in 2018 primarily due to depreciation resulting from increased software development.\nConsolidated Non-Operating Income (Expense)\nIncome and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered non-operating. The following tables present our non-operating income (expenses) (dollars in millions):\nTable 210: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>174\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>135\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(244\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(187\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(187\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(178\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income, net\n</td> <td>159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>326\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(51\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>326\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(63\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>147\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>147\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(129\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to non-controlling interest\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(32\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(28\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(28\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(27\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Income\nWe recognized interest income on our investments of $22 million, $8 million and $3 million during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Interest income increased in 2018 from 2017 primarily due to a rise in short-term interest rates on various investments.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased in 2018 from 2017, primarily due to an increase in the principal and coupon of our bond refinancing in August 2018, as well as a rise in short-term interest rates impacting our Commercial Paper Program. Interest expense increased in 2017 from 2016, primarily due to interest expense that we recognized relating to our bond refinancing in August 2017, partially offset by the September 2017 repayment of $850 million of 2.00% senior unsecured fixed rate notes that were due in October 2017. See - Debt\u201d below.\nOther income, net\nIn December 2017, we sold Trayport to TMX Group for \u00a3550 million ($733 million). We recognized a net gain of $110 million on the divestiture of Trayport, which was recorded as other income in 2017.\nIn connection with Cetip's merger with BM&FBOVESPA S.A., now B3, and its subsequent sale, we recognized a $176 million realized investment gain in other income in 2017 and $9 million in foreign exchange losses and transaction expenses in other expense in 2017. We recognized dividend income received relating to our investment in Cetip in other income, which was $5 million and $17 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. We no longer receive dividends from Cetip subsequent to its sale in the first quarter of 2017.\nWe account for our investments in The Options Clearing Corporation, or OCC, and MERS until our October 2018 acquisition of MERS, as equity method investments. We recognized $46 million, $36 million and $25 million in equity income related to these investments during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as other income. Prior to October 2018, we owned a majority stake in MERS and treated it as an equity method investment because we did not have the ability to control its operations. On October 3, 2018, we completed the purchase of all remaining interests of MERS and subsequently own 100% of MERS. On that date, we gained control of MERS, began to include MERS's results as part of our consolidated operations and recognized a $110 million gain on our initial investment value in MERS as other income. MERS is now part of ICE Mortgage Services.\nIn connection with our equity investment in Euroclear, we recognized dividend income of $15 million in 2018, which is included in other income.\nIn connection with our adoption of ASU 2017-07, we are recognizing the other components of net benefit cost of our defined\nbenefit plans in the income statement as non-operating income on a full retrospective basis. The combined net periodic (expense) benefit of these plans was ($8 million) and $9 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nWe incurred foreign currency transaction losses of $2 million, $4 million and $1 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This was primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency gains and losses are recorded in other income, net, when the settlement of foreign currency assets, liabilities and payables that occur through our foreign operations that are received in non-functional currencies due to the increase or decrease in the period-end foreign currency exchange rates between periods. See", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons. See the factors set forth under the heading Forward Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of Part 1 of this Annual Report and in Item 1(A) under the heading Risk Factors.\u201d The following discussion is qualified in its entirety by, and should be read in conjunction with, the more detailed information contained in Item 6 Selected Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.\nOverview\nWe are a leading global operator of regulated exchanges, clearing houses and listings venues, and a provider of data services for commodity, financial, fixed income and equity markets. We operate regulated marketplaces for listing, trading and clearing of a broad array of derivatives contracts and securities across major asset classes, including energy and agricultural commodities, metals, interest rates, equities, ETFs, credit derivatives, bonds and currencies. We also offer comprehensive data services to support the trading, investment, risk management and connectivity needs of customers around the world and across asset classes.\nOur exchanges include derivative exchanges in the U.S., U.K., EU, Canada and Singapore, and cash equities, equity options and bond exchanges in the U.S. We also operate OTC markets for physical energy, fixed income and CDS trade execution. To serve global derivatives markets, we operate central counterparty, or CCP, clearing houses in the U.S., U.K., EU, Canada and Singapore. We offer a range of data services for global financial and commodity markets, including pricing and reference data, exchange data, analytics, feeds, index services, desktops and connectivity solutions. Through our markets, clearing houses, listings and data services, we provide comprehensive solutions for our customers through liquid markets, benchmark products, access to capital markets and related services to support their ability to manage risk and raise capital. Our business is currently conducted as two reportable business segments, our Trading and Clearing segment and our Data and Listings segment, and the majority of our identifiable assets are located in the U.S., U.K. and Canada.\nRecent Developments\nU.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or TCJA\nIn December 2017, the TCJA was signed into law. It reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. Many of the tax provisions under the TCJA became effective January 1, 2018, including the new rate and complex international tax provisions. Given the complexity of these international provisions and certain potential unintended consequences that are under debate at both the federal and state level, certain federal and state guidance has been issued and further guidance is anticipated, but the likelihood and timing of such guidance remains uncertain. See - Consolidated Income Tax Provision\u201d below.\nAcquisitions\nOn January 2, 2018, we acquired BondPoint from Virtu Financial, Inc. for $400 million in cash. BondPoint is a provider of electronic fixed income trading solutions for the buy-side and sell-side, offering access to centralized liquidity and automated trade execution services through its ATS and provides trading services to more than 500 financial services firms.\nOn July 18, 2018, we acquired CHX Holdings, Inc., the parent company of CHX, a full-service stock exchange, including trading, data and corporate listings services. CHX operates as a registered national securities exchange.\nOn July 23, 2018, we acquired TMC Bonds for $700 million in cash. The cash consideration is gross of $15 million cash held by TMC Bonds on the date of acquisition. TMC Bonds is an electronic fixed income marketplace, supporting anonymous trading across multiple protocols in various asset classes, including municipals, corporates, treasuries, agencies and certificates of deposit.\nOn October 3, 2018, we completed the purchase of the remaining equity interests in MERS and accordingly now have 100% ownership. On that date, we gained control of MERS, now part of ICE Mortgage Services, began to include its results as\npart of our consolidated operations, and recorded a $110 million gain on our initial investment value as other non-operating income.\nLaunch of Bakkt\nOn December 19, 2018, we and non-ICE limited partners funded the newly-formed entity, Bakkt, LLC, or Bakkt. Bakkt was formed to create an integrated platform that enables consumers and institutions to transact in digital assets. The Bakkt ecosystem is designed to include regulated trading, clearing and custodial solutions for digital assets, which will be supported by ICE Futures U.S. and ICE Clear U.S. The first traded contract targeted for launch will be a Bakkt Bitcoin physically delivered daily futures contract to provide price discovery. The custodial solution will establish new protocols for managing the specific security and settlement requirements of digital currencies. In addition, there will be a separate guaranty fund. It is also expected that Bakkt will offer additional solutions to expand the range of uses for digital assets.\nInvestment in Euroclear\nDuring 2017, we purchased a 4.7% stake in Euroclear valued at \u20ac276 million in cash ($327 million). Upon purchasing this stake, we agreed to participate on the Euroclear Board of Directors. During the same period, we negotiated an additional purchase which closed on February 21, 2018, following regulatory approval. This provided us with an additional 5.1% stake in Euroclear for a purchase price of \u20ac246 million in cash ($304 million). As of December 31, 2018, we own a 9.8% stake in Euroclear for a total investment of $631 million. Euroclear is a provider of post-trade services, including settlement, central securities depositories and related services for cross-border transactions across asset classes. Refer to Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for more information.\nPurchase of Non-Controlling Interests\nFor consolidated subsidiaries in which our ownership is less than 100% and for which we have control over the assets, liabilities and management of the entity, the outside stockholders' interests are shown as non-controlling interest in our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2017, non-controlling interest consisted of the operating results of our CDS clearing subsidiaries in which non-ICE limited partners held a 29.9% ownership interest. During September 2018, we purchased a 3.2% ownership interest from a non-ICE limited partner and the remaining other limited partners hold a 26.7% ownership interest as of December 31, 2018.\nConsolidated Financial Highlights\nThe following summarizes our results and significant changes in our consolidated financial performance for the periods presented (dollars in millions, except per share amounts):\nTable 165: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

The increase in revenues includes $26 million in favorable foreign exchange effects arising from the weaker U.S. dollar in 2018 from 2017. \n \u2022 Revenues, less transaction-based expenses, increased $126 million in 2017 from 2016. The increase in revenues includes $22 million in unfavorable foreign exchange effects arising from the strengthening U.S. dollar in 2017 from 2016. \n \u2022 Operating expenses increased $137 million in 2018 from 2017. The increase in operating expenses includes $11 million in unfavorable foreign exchange effects arising from the weaker U.S. dollar in 2018 from 2017. \n \u2022 Operating expenses decreased $81 million in 2017 from 2016. The decrease in operating expenses includes $13 million in favorable foreign exchange effects arising from the strengthening U.S. dollar in 2017 from 2016. \n \u2022 In connection with our acquisition of MERS, we recorded a $110 million gain in other income during 2018. In connection with Cetip's merger with BM&FBOVESPA S.A., now B3, we recognized a $167 million net realized investment gain in other income, net in 2017. We also recognized a net gain of $110 million in connection with our divestiture of Trayport in other income (expense), net in 2017. \n \u2022 Excluding the 2017 deferred tax benefit from the U.S. tax law changes, the 2018 effective tax rate is lower than the 2017 effective tax rate due to the TCJA, which reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, tax benefits from our acquisition of MERS, deferred tax benefits from the U.S. tax rate reduction resulting from changes in estimates and additional tax benefits associated with our sale of Trayport. \n \u2022 The 2017 effective tax rate is lower than the 2016 effective tax rate due to a $764 million deferred tax benefit associated with the enactment of the TCJA in 2017.  Business Environment and Market Trends\nOur business environment has been characterized by:\n \u2022 globalization of exchanges, customers and competitors; \n \u2022 lower interest rates and financial markets uncertainty; \n \u2022 rising demand for speed, data, data capacity and connectivity by market participants, necessitating increased investment in technology; \n \u2022 evolving and disparate regulation across multiple jurisdictions; \n \u2022 increasing focus on capital and cost efficiencies; and \n \u2022 consolidation and increasing competition among global markets for trading, clearing and listings.  Price volatility increases the need to hedge risk and creates demand among market participants for the exchange of risk through trading and clearing. Market liquidity is one of the primary market attributes for attracting and maintaining customers and is an important indicator of a market's strength. In addition, the ability to evolve existing products to serve emerging needs, develop new products and respond to competitive dynamics in pricing, exclusivity and consolidation is important to our business.\nRecent changes with regard to global financial reform have emphasized the importance of transparent markets, centralized clearing and access to data, all of which are important aspects of our product offering. However, some of the proposed rules have yet to be implemented and some rules that have already been partially implemented are being reconsidered. In addition, some of the global regulations have not been fully harmonized and several of the MiFID II regulations are inconsistent with U.S. rules. As the evolution continues, legislative and regulatory actions may change the way we conduct our business and may create uncertainty for market participants, which could affect trading volumes or demand for market data. As a result, it is difficult to predict all of the effects that the legislation and its implementing regulations will have on us. As discussed more fully in Item 1 - Business - Regulation\u201d included in this Annual Report, Brexit, the implementation of MiFID II and other regulations may result in operational, regulatory and/or business risk.\nIn recent years, low interest rates and uncertainty in the financial markets continued to reflect the impact of a relatively slow economic recovery. Lower growth in Asia and the EU may also continue to affect global financial markets. In addition, economic and regulatory uncertainty, coupled with periods of high market volatility around geopolitical events, low interest rates and low natural gas prices, has affected our clients' activities in recent years. The duration of these trends will determine the continued impact on our business.\nWe have diversified our business so that we are not dependent on volatility or trading activity in any one asset class. In addition, we have increased our portion of non-transaction and clearing revenues from 39% in 2014 to 56% in 2018. This non-transaction revenue includes data services and listings.\nMany of the data products we sell and services we provide are required for our clients' business operations regardless of market volatility or shifts in business profitability levels. We anticipate that there will continue to be growth in the financial information services sector driven by a number of global trends, including the following:\n \u2022 increasing global regulatory demands; \n \u2022 greater use of fair value accounting standards and reliance on independent valuations; \n \u2022 greater emphasis on risk management; \n \u2022 market fragmentation driven by regulatory changes; \n \u2022 the move to passive investing and indexation; \n \u2022 ongoing growth in the size and diversity of financial markets; \n \u2022 increased automation of fixed income and other less automated markets; \n \u2022 the development of new data products; \n \u2022 the demand for greater data capacity and connectivity; \n \u2022 new entrants; and \n \u2022 increasing demand for outsourced services by financial institutions.  We continue to focus on our strategy to grow each of our revenue streams, as well as on our company-wide expense reduction initiatives and our synergies in connection with our acquisitions in order to mitigate these uncertainties and to build on our growth opportunities by leveraging our proprietary data, clearing and markets.\nSegment Results\nOur business is conducted through two reportable business segments:\n \u2022 Trading and Clearing, which comprises our transaction-based execution and clearing businesses; and \n \u2022 Data and Listings, which comprises our subscription-based data services and securities listings businesses.  While revenues are recorded specifically in the segment in which they are earned or to which they relate, a significant portion of our operating expenses are not solely related to a specific segment because the expenses serve functions that are necessary for the operation of both segments. We use a pro-rata revenue approach as the allocation method for the expenses that do not relate solely to one segment. Further, we did not allocate expenses to specific revenue streams within these segments since such an allocation is not reasonably possible. Our two segments do not engage in intersegment transactions.\nTrading and Clearing Segment\nThe following presents selected statements of income data for our Trading and Clearing segment (dollars in millions):\n(1) The adjusted numbers in the charts above are calculated by excluding items that are not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance.

reported on a net basis, except for the NYSE transaction-based expenses discussed below, and consist of fees collected from our derivatives, fixed income, cash equities and equity options trading and derivatives clearing. In our derivatives markets, we earn transaction and clearing revenues from both counterparties to each contract that is traded and/or cleared, and in our equity and equity options markets, we receive trade execution fees as well as routing fees related to orders in our markets which are routed to other markets for execution.\nRates per-contract, or RPC, are driven by the number of contracts or securities traded and the fees charged per contract, net of certain rebates. Our per-contract transaction and clearing revenues will depend upon many factors, including, but not limited to, market conditions, transaction and clearing volume, product mix, pricing, applicable revenue sharing and market making agreements, and new product introductions. Because transaction and clearing revenues are generally assessed on a per-contract basis, revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume and due to product mix.\nIn 2018, 2017 and 2016, 20%, 20% and 19%, respectively, of our Trading and Clearing segment revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were billed in pounds sterling or euros. Due to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro over the last two years compared to the U.S. dollar, our Trading and Clearing segment revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were higher by $18 million in 2018 from 2017, and were lower by $14 million in 2017 from 2016.\nOur transaction and clearing revenues are presented net of rebates. We recorded rebates of $844 million, $749 million and $674 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We offer rebates in certain of our markets primarily to support market liquidity and trading volume by providing qualified participants in those markets a discount to the applicable commission rate. Such rebates are calculated based on volumes traded. The increase in the rebates is due primarily to an increase in the number of participants in the rebate programs offered on various contracts, an increase in our traded volume and an increase in the number of rebate programs.\n \u2022 Energy Futures and Options Contracts: Total energy volume and revenues increased 1% and 6%, respectively, in 2018 from 2017, and increased 8% and 5%, respectively, in 2017 from 2016. Revenues increased in 2018 from 2017 due to a higher mix of gasoil, emissions and TTF gas volumes, which have a higher average RPC than other energy products.  Total oil volume increased 3% in 2018 from 2017, and increased 14% in 2017 from 2016. ICE Brent crude futures and options volume was flat in 2018 from 2017, and increased 15% in 2017 from 2016. ICE WTI crude futures and options volume increased 5% in 2018 from 2017, and increased 14% in 2017 from 2016. The volume increases were primarily due to increased oil price volatility related to shifting supply and demand dynamics globally; broader market volatility in oil products, equities and foreign exchange rates; acts of central governments; outcomes of elections; and uncertainty around the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, policy. Our record gasoil futures and options volume in 2018 increased 11% from 2017, and increased 13% in 2017 from 2016. Gasoil futures and options increased during 2018 and 2017 primarily due to increased demand for distillates, strong economic activity in Europe and Asia and regulatory uncertainty.\nOur global natural gas futures and options volume decreased 4% in 2018 from 2017, and decreased 1% in 2017 from 2016. The volume decrease in 2018 from 2017 was primarily due to lower U.S. price volatility reducing our commercial customers' need to hedge the Henry Hub contract, and depressed gas prices driven by a continued surplus of natural gas during 2018 as compared to 2017. Our 2018 Henry Hub natural gas volume decrease was partially offset by increased volumes in our North American basis market and TTF gas in Europe. Our record TTF gas volumes in 2018 were driven by changing natural gas dynamics due to the continued globalization of natural gas. Emission futures and options volumes increased 73% in 2018 from 2017, and increased 1% in 2017 from 2016. Our record emissions volumes in 2018 were driven by higher carbon prices and supply-demand dynamics impacted by regulatory uncertainty.\n \u2022 Agricultural and Metals Futures and Options Contracts: Total volume and revenues in our agricultural and metals futures and options markets increased 15% and 16%, respectively, in 2018 from 2017, and decreased 7% and 5%, respectively, in 2017 from 2016. Volume in our largest agricultural contract, sugar futures and options, increased 20% in 2018 from 2017, and decreased 10% in 2017 from 2016. Other agricultural and metal futures and options volume increased 11% in 2018 from 2017, and decreased 4% in 2017 from 2016. The increases in agricultural volumes to record levels in 2018 were primarily driven by price volatility resulting from shifting supply and demand dynamics. The decreases in agricultural volume in 2017 were primarily driven by the reduced price volatility in 2017 compared to the higher price volatility in 2016. \n \u2022 Financial Futures and Options Contracts: Interest rates futures and options volume and revenue increased 14% and 19%, respectively, in 2018 from 2017, and increased 27% and 9%, respectively, in 2017 from 2016. Our record level interest rate futures and options volume in 2018 was driven by expectations for heightened central bank activity during 2018, coupled with geopolitical uncertainty in the U.K. and Europe. Interest rates futures and options revenues were $230 million, $193 million and $177 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Other financial futures and options volume decreased 9% in 2018 from 2017, and decreased 19% in 2017 from 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the termination of our exclusive license to list futures and options contracts on the Russell\u00ae indices. Excluding the futures and options contracts on the Russell\u00ae indices, other financial futures and options volume increased 18% in 2018 from 2017. Other financial futures and options revenues were $124 million, $133 million and $141 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n \u2022 Cash Equities and Equity Options: Cash equities handled volume increased 14% in 2018 from 2017, primarily due to higher total U.S. equity volumes driven by heightened volatility in the U.S. equity markets coupled with the May \n2018 commencement of trading of NYSE National and the July 2018 acquisition of CHX. Cash equities handled volume decreased 17% in 2017 from 2016, primarily due to reduced U.S. equities market volatility during 2017 as compared to 2016. Cash equities revenues, net of transaction-based expenses, were $220 million, $196 million, and $223 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nEquity options volume increased 43% in 2018 from 2017 primarily due to heightened volatility in the U.S. equity markets, as well as increased market share in 2018 due to greater volatility. Equity options volume decreased 13% in 2017 from 2016 primarily due to lower U.S. equity market volatility and the restructuring of the NYSE American Options business. Equity options revenues, net of transaction-based expenses, were $107 million, $90 million and $98 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n \u2022 Fixed Income and Credit: CDS clearing revenues were $139 million, $113 million and $107 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The notional value of CDS cleared was $16.4 trillion, $11.5 trillion and $11.5 trillion, in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Buy-side participation at our U.S. CDS clearing house, ICE Clear Credit, reached record levels in terms of number of participants and notional cleared due to increased participation from both U.S. and European buy-side customers due to greater regulatory certainty, depth of liquidity, the breadth of products offered, and cost efficient margining in the U.S. relative to Europe. Fixed income and credit also includes revenues from ICE Bonds, which includes ICE BondPoint, TMC Bonds, ICE Credit Trade and ICE Mortgage Services. \n \u2022 OTC and Other Transactions: OTC and other transactions include revenues from our OTC energy business and other trade confirmation services. \n \u2022 Other Revenues: Other revenues primarily include interest income on certain clearing margin deposits, regulatory penalties and fines, fees for use of our facilities, regulatory fees charged to member organizations of our U.S. securities exchanges, designated market maker service fees, exchange membership fees and agricultural grading and certification fees. The increase in other revenues in 2018 from 2017 is primarily due to increased interest income earned on certain clearing margin deposits, as well as a $5 million settlement received by NYSE Regulation from ING Financial Markets, LLC, or ING, following an investigation into improper conduct by ING's lending desk from 2007 to 2015. The 2018 increase was partially offset by a $6 million breakup fee received in August 2017 related to the termination of the derivatives clearing agreement with Euronext Group N.V.'s, or Euronext, under which ICE Clear Netherlands was to provide clearing of Euronext's financial and commodity derivatives. \nSelected Operating Data\nThe following charts and table present trading activity in our

crossing session activity internally matched on our exchanges or routed to and executed on an external market center. Matched volume represents the total number of shares of equity securities, ETFs and crossing session activity executed on our exchanges.\nFor NYSE cash equities, market share increased in 2018 due to increased equity market volatility, the commencement of trading on NYSE National and the acquisition of CHX. NYSE cash equities market share declined during 2017 due to historically low volatility driving more trading to off-exchange trading venues, particularly dark-pools. For NYSE equity options, 2018 market share improved due to greater equity market volatility and decreased in 2017 due to a strategic focus on maximizing revenues in an extremely competitive environment.\nTransaction-Based Expenses\nOur equities and equity options markets pay fees to the SEC pursuant to Section 31 of the Exchange Act. Section 31 fees are recorded on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue. These Section 31 fees are assessed to recover the government's costs of supervising and regulating the securities markets and professionals. We, in turn, collect corresponding activity assessment fees from member organizations clearing or settling trades on the equities and options exchanges, and recognize these amounts in our transaction and clearing revenues when invoiced. The activity assessment fees are designed to equal the Section 31 fees. As a result, activity assessment fees and the corresponding Section 31 fees do not have an impact on our net income, although the timing of payment by us may vary from collections. The fees we collect are included in cash at the time of receipt and we remit the amounts to the SEC semi-annually as required. The total amount is included in accrued liabilities and was $105 million as of December 31, 2018.\nWe make liquidity payments to cash and options trading customers, as well as routing charges made to other exchanges included in transaction-based expenses. We incur routing charges when we do not have the best bid or offer in the market for a security that a customer is trying to buy or sell on one of our securities exchanges. In that case, we route the customer's order to the external market center that displays the best bid or offer. The external market center charges us a fee per share (denominated in tenths of a cent per share) for routing to its system. We record routing charges on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue.\nOperating Expenses, Operating Income and Operating Margin\nOur Trading and Clearing segment operating expenses increased $130 million in 2018 from 2017, and decreased $45 million in 2017 from 2016, partially related to the $33 million Creditex customer relationship intangible asset impairment expense recorded in 2016. See - Consolidated Operating Expenses\u201d below for a discussion of the significant changes in our operating expenses. Our Trading and Clearing segment operating income increased $162 million in 2018 from 2017, and increased $71 million in 2017 from 2016. Trading and Clearing segment operating margins were 62%, 63% and 61% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The operating income increases in the last two years were driven by the revenue increases discussed above.\nOur Trading and Clearing segment adjusted operating expenses were $824 million, $714 million and $716 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our Trading and Clearing segment adjusted operating income was $1.6 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.4 billion in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our Trading and Clearing segment adjusted operating margins were 66% in 2018, 2017 and 2016.

Through ICE Data Services, we generate revenues from a range of global financial and commodity markets, including pricing and reference data, exchange data, analytics, feeds, index services, desktops and connectivity solutions. Through NYSE, NYSE American and NYSE Arca, we generate listings revenue related to the provision of listings services for public companies and ETFs, and related corporate actions for listed companies.\nIn 2018, 2017 and 2016, 8%, 10% and 12%, respectively, of our Data and Listings segment revenues were billed in pounds sterling or euros (all relating to our data services revenues). As the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the U.S. equivalent of revenues denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly. Due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar compared to the pound sterling and euro during 2018, our data services revenues were higher by $7 million in 2018 than in 2017. Due to the weakening of the pound sterling and euro compared to the U.S. dollar during 2017, our data services revenues were lower by $8 million in 2017 than in 2016.\nOur data services revenues are primarily subscription-based and increased 1% in 2018 from 2017, and increased 5% in 2017 from 2016. The increases in revenues in both 2018 and 2017 were primarily due to the strong retention rate of\nexisting customers, the addition of new customers, increased purchases by existing customers and increases in pricing of our products, partially offset by the divestitures of IDMS in March 2017 and Trayport in December 2017 within our desktop and connectivity business. The increase in revenue in 2017 from 2016 was also partially due to our acquisitions of TMX Atrium in May 2017 and BofAML's Global Research division's index business in October 2017 and the impact of foreign currency translation.\n \u2022 Pricing and Analytics: Our pricing and analytics revenues increased 7% in 2018 from 2017 and increased 13% in 2017 from 2016. The increases in revenue were driven by the strong retention rate of existing customers, the addition of new customers, increased purchases by existing customers, increases in pricing of our products and the acquisition and further distribution of the ICE BofAML Indices. \n \u2022 Exchange Data and Feeds: Our exchange data and feeds revenues increased 6% in 2018 from 2017 and increased 5% in 2017 from 2016. The increases in revenues were driven by the strong retention rate of existing customers, the addition of new customers, increased purchases by existing customers and a larger share of the NMS Plan revenue. \n \u2022 Desktops and Connectivity: Our desktop and connectivity revenues decreased 17% in 2018 from 2017 and decreased 7% in 2017 from 2016 driven primarily by the divestitures of IDMS and Trayport in 2017.  Annual Subscription Value, or ASV, represents, at a point in time, the data services revenues subscribed for the succeeding 12 months. ASV does not include new sales, contract terminations or price changes that may occur during that 12-month period. ASV also does not include certain data services revenue streams that are not subscription-based. Revenue from ASV businesses has historically represented approximately 90% of our data revenues. Thus, while it is an indicative forward-looking metric, it does not provide a growth forecast of the next 12 months of data services revenues.\nAs of December 31, 2018, ASV was $1.922 billion, which increased 6.1% compared to the ASV as of December 31, 2017. This does not adjust for year-over-year foreign exchange fluctuations or impacts of acquisitions. Underpinning this growth is strength in our pricing & analytics business.\nListings Revenues\nListings revenues in our securities markets arise from fees applicable to companies listed on our cash equities exchanges - original listing fees and annual listing fees. Original listing fees consist of two components: initial listing fees and fees related to corporate actions. Initial listing fees, subject to a minimum and maximum amount, are based on the number of shares that a company initially lists. All listings fees are billed upfront and the identified performance obligations are satisfied over time. Revenue related to the investor relations performance obligation is recognized ratably over a two-year period, with the remaining revenue recognized ratably over time as customers continue to list on our exchanges, which is generally estimated to be over a period of up to nine years for NYSE and up to five years for NYSE Arca and NYSE American.\nIn addition, we earn corporate actions-related listing fees in connection with actions involving the issuance of new shares, such as stock splits, rights issues and sales of additional securities, as well as mergers and acquisitions. Listings fees related to other corporate actions are considered contract modifications of our listing contracts and are recognized ratably over time as customers continue to list on our exchanges, which is generally estimated to be a period of six years for NYSE and three years for NYSE Arca and NYSE American.\nOur listings revenues increased 4% in 2018 from 2017 and decreased 1% in 2017 from 2016 due to changes in market conditions for IPOs.\nOperating Expenses, Operating Income and Operating Margin\nOur Data and Listings segment operating expenses increased $7 million in 2018 from 2017, and decreased $36 million in 2017 from 2016. See - Consolidated Operating Expenses\u201d below for a discussion of the significant changes in our operating expenses. Our Data and Listings segment operating income increased $42 million in 2018 from 2017, and increased $136 million in 2017 from 2016. Our Data and Listings segment operating margins were 42%, 41% and 37% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The operating income and operating margin increases during 2018 and 2017 were driven by the revenue increases discussed above.\nOur Data and Listings segment adjusted operating expenses were $1.2 billion in 2018, 2017 and 2016. Our Data and Listings segment adjusted operating income was $1.3 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our Data and Listings segment adjusted operating margins were 51%, 51% and 49% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. See - Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below.\nConsolidated Operating Expenses\nThe following presents our consolidated operating expenses (dollars in millions):\nTable 209: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Compensation and benefits\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>946\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>946\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>953\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional services\n</td> <td>131\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>137\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition-related transaction and integration costs\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(56\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Technology and communication\n</td> <td>432\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>397\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>397\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rent and occupancy\n</td> <td>68\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>586\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>535\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>535\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>610\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe majority of our operating expenses do not vary directly with changes in our volume and revenues, except for certain technology and communication expenses and a portion of our compensation expense that is tied directly to our data sales or overall financial performance.\nWe expect our operating expenses to increase in absolute terms in future periods in connection with our acquisitions and growth of our business, and to vary from year-to-year based on the type and level of our acquisitions, our integrations and other investments.\nIn 2018, 2017 and 2016, 13%, 14% and 18%, respectively, of our operating expenses were incurred in pounds sterling or euros. Due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar compared to the pound sterling and euro in 2018, our consolidated operating expenses were higher by $12 million in 2018 than in 2017. Due to the weakening of the pound sterling and euro as compared to the U.S. dollar in 2017, our consolidated operating expenses were lower by $14 million in 2017 than in 2016. See Item 7(A) - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\u201d below for additional information.\nCompensation and Benefits Expenses\nCompensation and benefits expense is our most significant operating expense and includes non-capitalized employee wages, bonuses, non-cash or stock compensation, certain severance costs, benefits and employer taxes. The bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on both our financial performance and the individual employee performance. The performance-based restricted stock compensation expense is also based on our financial performance. Therefore, our compensation and benefits expense will vary year-to-year based on our financial performance and fluctuations in the number of employees.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had 5,161 employees, compared to 4,952 and 5,631 as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Our employee headcount increased in 2018 from 2017 primarily due to new employees related to the acquisitions of BondPoint in January 2018, CHX Holdings, Inc. and TMC Bonds in July 2018 and MERS in October 2018, partially offset by continued employee terminations associated with our integration of Interactive Data. Our employee headcount decreased in 2017 from 2016 primarily due to the divestitures in 2017 of IDMS, Trayport and NYSE Governance Services, and employee terminations in connection with our integration of Interactive Data, partially offset by new employees related to the acquisitions of ICE NGX and TMX Atrium in 2017. See - Recent Developments\u201d above.\nOur compensation and benefits expenses increased in 2018 from 2017 primarily due to employee severance and retention costs and a net increase in our employee headcount, partially offset by a decrease in non-cash compensation expense. We incurred employee severance and retention costs of $41 million, $21 million and $10 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in compensation and benefits expenses in 2017 from 2016 was minimal.\nNon-cash compensation expenses recognized in our consolidated financial statements for employee stock options and restricted stock were $130 million, $135 million and $123 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in non-cash compensation expenses in 2018 from 2017 was primarily related to a change in ICE's non-cash incentive plans that reduced the overall amount of non-cash incentives awarded. The increase in non-cash compensation expenses in 2017 from 2016 primarily relates to the integration of the Interactive Data employees into the ICE non-cash incentive plans.\nProfessional Services Expenses\nThis expense includes fees for consulting services received on strategic and technology initiatives, temporary labor, as well as regulatory, legal and accounting fees, and may fluctuate as a result of changes in consulting and technology services, temporary labor, and regulatory, accounting and legal proceedings.\nProfessional services expenses increased in 2018 from 2017 primarily due to consulting and legal fees related to software development consulting costs. Professional services expenses decreased in 2017 from 2016 primarily due to the continued reduction in professional services and contractors at NYSE. We eliminated or replaced certain contractor positions with full-time employees at NYSE in 2016. In addition, during 2016, we recorded a credit from a third-party service provider related to fees charged in a prior period. Legal fees, which are included in professional services expenses, primarily related to class action lawsuits in which NYSE was a defendant. These decreases were partially offset by professional services expenses incurred by Interactive Data, Trayport, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis.\nAcquisition-Related Transaction and Integration Costs\nIn 2018, we incurred $34 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, primarily relating to employee terminations and lease terminations in connection with our our integrations of Interactive Data, Securities Evaluations and\nCredit Market Analysis, professional services costs from our 2018 acquisitions, and a $5 million banker success fee in connection with our acquisition of TMC Bonds. The integration of Interactive Data was completed by June 30, 2018.\nIn 2017, we incurred $36 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, primarily relating to our integrations of Interactive Data, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis and our acquisitions of BondPoint, TMX Atrium, the ICE BofAML Indices and NYSE National. Of this amount, $11 million was primarily related to the acquisitions. We incurred $25 million for Interactive Data, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis integration costs relating to employee and lease termination costs and professional services costs.\nIn 2016, we incurred $80 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs primarily relating to our integrations of Interactive Data and NYSE, legal and professional fees related to the Trayport CMA review, our investment in MERS, our acquisitions of Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis, and various other potential and discontinued acquisitions. Of this amount, $41 million was primarily related to the acquisitions and other transaction costs. We incurred $39 million for Interactive Data and NYSE integration costs during 2016, primarily relating to employee and lease termination costs and professional services costs. The integration of NYSE was completed in 2016 and no NYSE integration costs were incurred after 2016.\nWe expect to continue to explore and pursue various potential acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our competitive position and support our growth. As a result, we may incur acquisition-related transaction costs in future periods. See - Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below.\nTechnology and Communication Expenses\nTechnology support services consist of costs for running our wholly-owned data centers, hosting costs paid to third-party data centers, and maintenance of our computer hardware and software required to support our technology and cybersecurity. These costs are driven by system capacity, functionality and redundancy requirements. Communication expenses consist of costs for network connection for our electronic platforms, telecommunications costs, and fees paid for access to external market data. This expense also includes licensing and other fee agreement expenses which may be impacted by growth in electronic contract volume, our capacity requirements, changes in the number of telecommunications hubs and connections with customers to access our electronic platforms directly.\nTechnology and communications expenses increased in 2018 from 2017, primarily due to $17 million in data center migrations, hardware support upgrades and cybersecurity investments, $11 million in increased costs related to our recent acquisitions, net of divestitures, and $7 million in increased costs for external market data content acquisition and revenue share agreements related to our product offering. Technology and communications expenses increased in 2017 from 2016, primarily due to $14 million in increased hardware support upgrades and cybersecurity investments, and $10 million in costs related to our recent acquisitions, net of divestitures.\nRent and Occupancy Expenses\nRent and occupancy expense relates to leased and owned property and includes rent, maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities and other related costs. We have significant operations located in and around Atlanta, New York and London with smaller offices located throughout the world. See Item 2 - Properties\u201d above for additional information regarding our leased and owned property.\nExcluding the impact of the acquisitions, rent and occupancy expenses decreased the last two years primarily due to reduced rent and occupancy costs realized from the continued consolidation of our Atlanta, New York and London office locations.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include marketing, advertising, public relations, insurance, bank service charges, dues and subscriptions, travel and entertainment, non-income taxes and other general and administrative costs.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased in 2018 from 2017, primarily due to $14 million in accruals relating to SEC investigations and inquiries made during 2017. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased in 2017 from 2016, primarily due to the acquisitions of Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis and $14 million in accruals relating to SEC investigations and inquiries. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and the SEC investigations and inquiries, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased the last two years primarily due to lower marketing expenses. Refer to Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for more information on the SEC investigations and inquiries.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses\nDepreciation and amortization expense results from depreciation of long-lived assets such as buildings, leasehold improvements, planes, furniture, fixtures and equipment over their estimated useful lives. This expense includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our acquisitions of businesses, as well as on various licensing agreements, over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of customer relationships, trading products with finite lives and technology. This expense also includes amortization of internally-developed and purchased software over its estimated useful life.\nWe recorded amortization expenses on intangible assets acquired as part of our acquisitions, as well as on other intangible assets, of $289 million, $272 million and $323 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Amortization expense increased in 2018 from 2017, as a result of ICE NGX, BondPoint, TMC Bonds, the ICE BofAML Indices, MERS and TMX Atrium intangible assets. In addition, in 2018, we recorded a $4 million impairment loss on exchange registration intangible assets related to our closure of ICE Futures Canada and ICE Clear Canada as amortization expense. This increase in amortization expense was partially offset by a decrease in amortization recorded on our Russell license intangible assets in 2018 from 2017 due to these assets becoming fully amortized, and amortization expense recorded in 2017 as a result of the net loss of $6 million on the sale of NYSE Governance Services.\nThe decrease in the amortization expenses recorded on the intangible assets in 2017 from 2016 is primarily due to a reduction in amortization expenses recorded on intangible assets which became fully amortized (primarily related to certain of the NYSE intangible assets) and the divestitures of Trayport and NYSE Governance Services, partially offset by amortization expenses recorded on the Securities Evaluations, Credit Market Analysis, ICE NGX and TMX Atrium intangible assets. In 2016, we recorded an impairment of the Creditex customer relationship intangible asset of $33 million, which was recorded in depreciation and amortization expenses. In 2016, we sold certain of Creditex's U.S. voice brokerage operations to Tullett Prebon and discontinued Creditex's U.K. voice brokerage operations. We continue to operate Creditex's electronically traded markets and systems, post-trade connectivity platforms and intellectual property.\nWe recorded depreciation expenses on our fixed assets of $293 million, $257 million and $254 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, with the increase in 2018 primarily due to depreciation resulting from increased software development.\nConsolidated Non-Operating Income (Expense)\nIncome and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered non-operating. The following tables present our non-operating income (expenses) (dollars in millions):\nTable 210: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>174\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>135\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(244\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(187\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(187\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(178\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income, net\n</td> <td>159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>326\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(51\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>326\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(63\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>147\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>147\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(129\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to non-controlling interest\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(32\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(28\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(28\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(27\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Income\nWe recognized interest income on our investments of $22 million, $8 million and $3 million during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Interest income increased in 2018 from 2017 primarily due to a rise in short-term interest rates on various investments.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased in 2018 from 2017, primarily due to an increase in the principal and coupon of our bond refinancing in August 2018, as well as a rise in short-term interest rates impacting our Commercial Paper Program. Interest expense increased in 2017 from 2016, primarily due to interest expense that we recognized relating to our bond refinancing in August 2017, partially offset by the September 2017 repayment of $850 million of 2.00% senior unsecured fixed rate notes that were due in October 2017. See - Debt\u201d below.\nOther income, net\nIn December 2017, we sold Trayport to TMX Group for \u00a3550 million ($733 million). We recognized a net gain of $110 million on the divestiture of Trayport, which was recorded as other income in 2017.\nIn connection with Cetip's merger with BM&FBOVESPA S.A., now B3, and its subsequent sale, we recognized a $176 million realized investment gain in other income in 2017 and $9 million in foreign exchange losses and transaction expenses in other expense in 2017. We recognized dividend income received relating to our investment in Cetip in other income, which was $5 million and $17 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. We no longer receive dividends from Cetip subsequent to its sale in the first quarter of 2017.\nWe account for our investments in The Options Clearing Corporation, or OCC, and MERS until our October 2018 acquisition of MERS, as equity method investments. We recognized $46 million, $36 million and $25 million in equity income related to these investments during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as other income. Prior to October 2018, we owned a majority stake in MERS and treated it as an equity method investment because we did not have the ability to control its operations. On October 3, 2018, we completed the purchase of all remaining interests of MERS and subsequently own 100% of MERS. On that date, we gained control of MERS, began to include MERS's results as part of our consolidated operations and recognized a $110 million gain on our initial investment value in MERS as other income. MERS is now part of ICE Mortgage Services.\nIn connection with our equity investment in Euroclear, we recognized dividend income of $15 million in 2018, which is included in other income.\nIn connection with our adoption of ASU 2017-07, we are recognizing the other components of net benefit cost of our defined\nbenefit plans in the income statement as non-operating income on a full retrospective basis. The combined net periodic (expense) benefit of these plans was ($8 million) and $9 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nWe incurred foreign currency transaction losses of $2 million, $4 million and $1 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This was primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency gains and losses are recorded in other income, net, when the settlement of foreign currency assets, liabilities and payables that occur through our foreign operations that are received in non-functional currencies due to the increase or decrease in the period-end foreign currency exchange rates between periods. See", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons. See the factors set forth under the heading Forward Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of Part 1 of this Annual Report and in Item 1(A) under the heading Risk Factors.\u201d The following discussion is qualified in its entirety by, and should be read in conjunction with, the more detailed information contained in Item 6 Selected Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.\nOverview\nWe are a leading global operator of regulated exchanges, clearing houses and listings venues, and a provider of data services for commodity, financial, fixed income and equity markets. We operate regulated marketplaces for listing, trading and clearing of a broad array of derivatives contracts and securities across major asset classes, including energy and agricultural commodities, metals, interest rates, equities, ETFs, credit derivatives, bonds and currencies. We also offer comprehensive data services to support the trading, investment, risk management and connectivity needs of customers around the world and across asset classes.\nOur exchanges include derivative exchanges in the U.S., U.K., EU, Canada and Singapore, and cash equities, equity options and bond exchanges in the U.S. We also operate OTC markets for physical energy, fixed income and CDS trade execution. To serve global derivatives markets, we operate central counterparty, or CCP, clearing houses in the U.S., U.K., EU, Canada and Singapore. We offer a range of data services for global financial and commodity markets, including pricing and reference data, exchange data, analytics, feeds, index services, desktops and connectivity solutions. Through our markets, clearing houses, listings and data services, we provide comprehensive solutions for our customers through liquid markets, benchmark products, access to capital markets and related services to support their ability to manage risk and raise capital. Our business is currently conducted as two reportable business segments, our Trading and Clearing segment and our Data and Listings segment, and the majority of our identifiable assets are located in the U.S., U.K. and Canada.\nRecent Developments\nU.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or TCJA\nIn December 2017, the TCJA was signed into law. It reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. Many of the tax provisions under the TCJA became effective January 1, 2018, including the new rate and complex international tax provisions. Given the complexity of these international provisions and certain potential unintended consequences that are under debate at both the federal and state level, certain federal and state guidance has been issued and further guidance is anticipated, but the likelihood and timing of such guidance remains uncertain. See - Consolidated Income Tax Provision\u201d below.\nAcquisitions\nOn January 2, 2018, we acquired BondPoint from Virtu Financial, Inc. for $400 million in cash. BondPoint is a provider of electronic fixed income trading solutions for the buy-side and sell-side, offering access to centralized liquidity and automated trade execution services through its ATS and provides trading services to more than 500 financial services firms.\nOn July 18, 2018, we acquired CHX Holdings, Inc., the parent company of CHX, a full-service stock exchange, including trading, data and corporate listings services. CHX operates as a registered national securities exchange.\nOn July 23, 2018, we acquired TMC Bonds for $700 million in cash. The cash consideration is gross of $15 million cash held by TMC Bonds on the date of acquisition. TMC Bonds is an electronic fixed income marketplace, supporting anonymous trading across multiple protocols in various asset classes, including municipals, corporates, treasuries, agencies and certificates of deposit.\nOn October 3, 2018, we completed the purchase of the remaining equity interests in MERS and accordingly now have 100% ownership. On that date, we gained control of MERS, now part of ICE Mortgage Services, began to include its results as\npart of our consolidated operations, and recorded a $110 million gain on our initial investment value as other non-operating income.\nLaunch of Bakkt\nOn December 19, 2018, we and non-ICE limited partners funded the newly-formed entity, Bakkt, LLC, or Bakkt. Bakkt was formed to create an integrated platform that enables consumers and institutions to transact in digital assets. The Bakkt ecosystem is designed to include regulated trading, clearing and custodial solutions for digital assets, which will be supported by ICE Futures U.S. and ICE Clear U.S. The first traded contract targeted for launch will be a Bakkt Bitcoin physically delivered daily futures contract to provide price discovery. The custodial solution will establish new protocols for managing the specific security and settlement requirements of digital currencies. In addition, there will be a separate guaranty fund. It is also expected that Bakkt will offer additional solutions to expand the range of uses for digital assets.\nInvestment in Euroclear\nDuring 2017, we purchased a 4.7% stake in Euroclear valued at \u20ac276 million in cash ($327 million). Upon purchasing this stake, we agreed to participate on the Euroclear Board of Directors. During the same period, we negotiated an additional purchase which closed on February 21, 2018, following regulatory approval. This provided us with an additional 5.1% stake in Euroclear for a purchase price of \u20ac246 million in cash ($304 million). As of December 31, 2018, we own a 9.8% stake in Euroclear for a total investment of $631 million. Euroclear is a provider of post-trade services, including settlement, central securities depositories and related services for cross-border transactions across asset classes. Refer to Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for more information.\nPurchase of Non-Controlling Interests\nFor consolidated subsidiaries in which our ownership is less than 100% and for which we have control over the assets, liabilities and management of the entity, the outside stockholders' interests are shown as non-controlling interest in our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2017, non-controlling interest consisted of the operating results of our CDS clearing subsidiaries in which non-ICE limited partners held a 29.9% ownership interest. During September 2018, we purchased a 3.2% ownership interest from a non-ICE limited partner and the remaining other limited partners hold a 26.7% ownership interest as of December 31, 2018.\nConsolidated Financial Highlights\nThe following summarizes our results and significant changes in our consolidated financial performance for the periods presented (dollars in millions, except per share amounts):\n\n(1) The adjusted figures exclude items that are not reflective of our ongoing core operations and business performance. Adjusted net income attributable to ICE and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to ICE common stockholders, are presented net of taxes. These adjusted numbers are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. See - Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below.\n \u2022 Revenues, less transaction-based expenses, increased $341 million in 2018 from 2017. The increase in revenues includes $26 million in favorable foreign exchange effects arising from the weaker U.S. dollar in 2018 from 2017. \n \u2022 Revenues, less transaction-based expenses, increased $126 million in 2017 from 2016. The increase in revenues includes $22 million in unfavorable foreign exchange effects arising from the strengthening U.S. dollar in 2017 from 2016. \n \u2022 Operating expenses increased $137 million in 2018 from 2017. The increase in operating expenses includes $11 million in unfavorable foreign exchange effects arising from the weaker U.S. dollar in 2018 from 2017. \n \u2022 Operating expenses decreased $81 million in 2017 from 2016. The decrease in operating expenses includes $13 million in favorable foreign exchange effects arising from the strengthening U.S. dollar in 2017 from 2016. \n \u2022 In connection with our acquisition of MERS, we recorded a $110 million gain in other income during 2018. In connection with Cetip's merger with BM&FBOVESPA S.A., now B3, we recognized a $167 million net realized investment gain in other income, net in 2017. We also recognized a net gain of $110 million in connection with our divestiture of Trayport in other income (expense), net in 2017. \n \u2022 Excluding the 2017 deferred tax benefit from the U.S. tax law changes, the 2018 effective tax rate is lower than the 2017 effective tax rate due to the TCJA, which reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, tax benefits from our acquisition of MERS, deferred tax benefits from the U.S. tax rate reduction resulting from changes in estimates and additional tax benefits associated with our sale of Trayport. \n \u2022 The 2017 effective tax rate is lower than the 2016 effective tax rate due to a $764 million deferred tax benefit associated with the enactment of the TCJA in 2017.  Business Environment and Market Trends\nOur business environment has been characterized by:\n \u2022 globalization of exchanges, customers and competitors; \n \u2022 lower interest rates and financial markets uncertainty; \n \u2022 rising demand for speed, data, data capacity and connectivity by market participants, necessitating increased investment in technology; \n \u2022 evolving and disparate regulation across multiple jurisdictions; \n \u2022 increasing focus on capital and cost efficiencies; and \n \u2022 consolidation and increasing competition among global markets for trading, clearing and listings.  Price volatility increases the need to hedge risk and creates demand among market participants for the exchange of risk through trading and clearing. Market liquidity is one of the primary market attributes for attracting and maintaining customers and is an important indicator of a market's strength. In addition, the ability to evolve existing products to serve emerging needs, develop new products and respond to competitive dynamics in pricing, exclusivity and consolidation is important to our business.\nRecent changes with regard to global financial reform have emphasized the importance of transparent markets, centralized clearing and access to data, all of which are important aspects of our product offering. However, some of the proposed rules have yet to be implemented and some rules that have already been partially implemented are being reconsidered. In addition, some of the global regulations have not been fully harmonized and several of the MiFID II regulations are inconsistent with U.S. rules. As the evolution continues, legislative and regulatory actions may change the way we conduct our business and may create uncertainty for market participants, which could affect trading volumes or demand for market data. As a result, it is difficult to predict all of the effects that the legislation and its implementing regulations will have on us. As discussed more fully in Item 1 - Business - Regulation\u201d included in this Annual Report, Brexit, the implementation of MiFID II and other regulations may result in operational, regulatory and/or business risk.\nIn recent years, low interest rates and uncertainty in the financial markets continued to reflect the impact of a relatively slow economic recovery. Lower growth in Asia and the EU may also continue to affect global financial markets. In addition, economic and regulatory uncertainty, coupled with periods of high market volatility around geopolitical events, low interest rates and low natural gas prices, has affected our clients' activities in recent years. The duration of these trends will determine the continued impact on our business.\nWe have diversified our business so that we are not dependent on volatility or trading activity in any one asset class. In addition, we have increased our portion of non-transaction and clearing revenues from 39% in 2014 to 56% in 2018. This non-transaction revenue includes data services and listings.\nMany of the data products we sell and services we provide are required for our clients' business operations regardless of market volatility or shifts in business profitability levels. We anticipate that there will continue to be growth in the financial information services sector driven by a number of global trends, including the following:\n \u2022 increasing global regulatory demands; \n \u2022 greater use of fair value accounting standards and reliance on independent valuations; \n \u2022 greater emphasis on risk management; \n \u2022 market fragmentation driven by regulatory changes; \n \u2022 the move to passive investing and indexation; \n \u2022 ongoing growth in the size and diversity of financial markets; \n \u2022 increased automation of fixed income and other less automated markets; \n \u2022 the development of new data products; \n \u2022 the demand for greater data capacity and connectivity; \n \u2022 new entrants; and \n \u2022 increasing demand for outsourced services by financial institutions.  We continue to focus on our strategy to grow each of our revenue streams, as well as on our company-wide expense reduction initiatives and our synergies in connection with our acquisitions in order to mitigate these uncertainties and to build on our growth opportunities by leveraging our proprietary data, clearing and markets.\nSegment Results\nOur business is conducted through two reportable business segments:\n \u2022 Trading and Clearing, which comprises our transaction-based execution and clearing businesses; and \n \u2022 Data and Listings, which comprises our subscription-based data services and securities listings businesses.  While revenues are recorded specifically in the segment in which they are earned or to which they relate, a significant portion of our operating expenses are not solely related to a specific segment because the expenses serve functions that are necessary for the operation of both segments. We use a pro-rata revenue approach as the allocation method for the expenses that do not relate solely to one segment. Further, we did not allocate expenses to specific revenue streams within these segments since such an allocation is not reasonably possible. Our two segments do not engage in intersegment transactions.\nTrading and Clearing Segment\nThe following presents selected statements of income data for our Trading and Clearing segment (dollars in millions):\n(1) The adjusted numbers in the charts above are calculated by excluding items that are not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. As a result, these adjusted numbers are not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. See - Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below.\n\nTransaction and Clearing Revenues\nOur transaction and clearing revenues are reported on a net basis, except for the NYSE transaction-based expenses discussed below, and consist of fees collected from our derivatives, fixed income, cash equities and equity options trading and derivatives clearing. In our derivatives markets, we earn transaction and clearing revenues from both counterparties to each contract that is traded and/or cleared, and in our equity and equity options markets, we receive trade execution fees as well as routing fees related to orders in our markets which are routed to other markets for execution.\nRates per-contract, or RPC, are driven by the number of contracts or securities traded and the fees charged per contract, net of certain rebates. Our per-contract transaction and clearing revenues will depend upon many factors, including, but not limited to, market conditions, transaction and clearing volume, product mix, pricing, applicable revenue sharing and market making agreements, and new product introductions. Because transaction and clearing revenues are generally assessed on a per-contract basis, revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume and due to product mix.\nIn 2018, 2017 and 2016, 20%, 20% and 19%, respectively, of our Trading and Clearing segment revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were billed in pounds sterling or euros. Due to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro over the last two years compared to the U.S. dollar, our Trading and Clearing segment revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were higher by $18 million in 2018 from 2017, and were lower by $14 million in 2017 from 2016.\nOur transaction and clearing revenues are presented net of rebates. We recorded rebates of $844 million, $749 million and $674 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We offer rebates in certain of our markets primarily to support market liquidity and trading volume by providing qualified participants in those markets a discount to the applicable commission rate. Such rebates are calculated based on volumes traded. The increase in the rebates is due primarily to an increase in the number of participants in the rebate programs offered on various contracts, an increase in our traded volume and an increase in the number of rebate programs.\n \u2022 Energy Futures and Options Contracts: Total energy volume and revenues increased 1% and 6%, respectively, in 2018 from 2017, and increased 8% and 5%, respectively, in 2017 from 2016. Revenues increased in 2018 from 2017 due to a higher mix of gasoil, emissions and TTF gas volumes, which have a higher average RPC than other energy products.  Total oil volume increased 3% in 2018 from 2017, and increased 14% in 2017 from 2016. ICE Brent crude futures and options volume was flat in 2018 from 2017, and increased 15% in 2017 from 2016. ICE WTI crude futures and options volume increased 5% in 2018 from 2017, and increased 14% in 2017 from 2016. The volume increases were primarily due to increased oil price volatility related to shifting supply and demand dynamics globally; broader market volatility in oil products, equities and foreign exchange rates; acts of central governments; outcomes of elections; and uncertainty around the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, policy. Our record gasoil futures and options volume in 2018 increased 11% from 2017, and increased 13% in 2017 from 2016. Gasoil futures and options increased during 2018 and 2017 primarily due to increased demand for distillates, strong economic activity in Europe and Asia and regulatory uncertainty.\nOur global natural gas futures and options volume decreased 4% in 2018 from 2017, and decreased 1% in 2017 from 2016. The volume decrease in 2018 from 2017 was primarily due to lower U.S. price volatility reducing our commercial customers' need to hedge the Henry Hub contract, and depressed gas prices driven by a continued surplus of natural gas during 2018 as compared to 2017. Our 2018 Henry Hub natural gas volume decrease was partially offset by increased volumes in our North American basis market and TTF gas in Europe. Our record TTF gas volumes in 2018 were driven by changing natural gas dynamics due to the continued globalization of natural gas. Emission futures and options volumes increased 73% in 2018 from 2017, and increased 1% in 2017 from 2016. Our record emissions volumes in 2018 were driven by higher carbon prices and supply-demand dynamics impacted by regulatory uncertainty.\n \u2022 Agricultural and Metals Futures and Options Contracts: Total volume and revenues in our agricultural and metals futures and options markets increased 15% and 16%, respectively, in 2018 from 2017, and decreased 7% and 5%, respectively, in 2017 from 2016. Volume in our largest agricultural contract, sugar futures and options, increased 20% in 2018 from 2017, and decreased 10% in 2017 from 2016. Other agricultural and metal futures and options volume increased 11% in 2018 from 2017, and decreased 4% in 2017 from 2016. The increases in agricultural volumes to record levels in 2018 were primarily driven by price volatility resulting from shifting supply and demand dynamics. The decreases in agricultural volume in 2017 were primarily driven by the reduced price volatility in 2017 compared to the higher price volatility in 2016. \n \u2022 Financial Futures and Options Contracts: Interest rates futures and options volume and revenue increased 14% and 19%, respectively, in 2018 from 2017, and increased 27% and 9%, respectively, in 2017 from 2016. Our record level interest rate futures and options volume in 2018 was driven by expectations for heightened central bank activity during 2018, coupled with geopolitical uncertainty in the U.K. and Europe. Interest rates futures and options revenues were $230 million, $193 million and $177 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Other financial futures and options volume decreased 9% in 2018 from 2017, and decreased 19% in 2017 from 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the termination of our exclusive license to list futures and options contracts on the Russell\u00ae indices. Excluding the futures and options contracts on the Russell\u00ae indices, other financial futures and options volume increased 18% in 2018 from 2017. Other financial futures and options revenues were $124 million, $133 million and $141 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n \u2022 Cash Equities and Equity Options: Cash equities handled volume increased 14% in 2018 from 2017, primarily due to higher total U.S. equity volumes driven by heightened volatility in the U.S. equity markets coupled with the May \n2018 commencement of trading of NYSE National and the July 2018 acquisition of CHX. Cash equities handled volume decreased 17% in 2017 from 2016, primarily due to reduced U.S. equities market volatility during 2017 as compared to 2016. Cash equities revenues, net of transaction-based expenses, were $220 million, $196 million, and $223 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nEquity options volume increased 43% in 2018 from 2017 primarily due to heightened volatility in the U.S. equity markets, as well as increased market share in 2018 due to greater volatility. Equity options volume decreased 13% in 2017 from 2016 primarily due to lower U.S. equity market volatility and the restructuring of the NYSE American Options business. Equity options revenues, net of transaction-based expenses, were $107 million, $90 million and $98 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n \u2022 Fixed Income and Credit: CDS clearing revenues were $139 million, $113 million and $107 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The notional value of CDS cleared was $16.4 trillion, $11.5 trillion and $11.5 trillion, in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Buy-side participation at our U.S. CDS clearing house, ICE Clear Credit, reached record levels in terms of number of participants and notional cleared due to increased participation from both U.S. and European buy-side customers due to greater regulatory certainty, depth of liquidity, the breadth of products offered, and cost efficient margining in the U.S. relative to Europe. Fixed income and credit also includes revenues from ICE Bonds, which includes ICE BondPoint, TMC Bonds, ICE Credit Trade and ICE Mortgage Services. \n \u2022 OTC and Other Transactions: OTC and other transactions include revenues from our OTC energy business and other trade confirmation services. \n \u2022 Other Revenues: Other revenues primarily include interest income on certain clearing margin deposits, regulatory penalties and fines, fees for use of our facilities, regulatory fees charged to member organizations of our U.S. securities exchanges, designated market maker service fees, exchange membership fees and agricultural grading and certification fees. The increase in other revenues in 2018 from 2017 is primarily due to increased interest income earned on certain clearing margin deposits, as well as a $5 million settlement received by NYSE Regulation from ING Financial Markets, LLC, or ING, following an investigation into improper conduct by ING's lending desk from 2007 to 2015. The 2018 increase was partially offset by a $6 million breakup fee received in August 2017 related to the termination of the derivatives clearing agreement with Euronext Group N.V.'s, or Euronext, under which ICE Clear Netherlands was to provide clearing of Euronext's financial and commodity derivatives. \nSelected Operating Data\nThe following charts and table present trading activity in our futures and options markets by commodity type based on the total number of contracts traded, as well as futures and options rate per contract (in millions, except for percentages and rate per contract amounts):  Volume and Rate per Contract \n\nOpen interest is the aggregate number of contracts (long or short) that clearing members hold either for their own account or on behalf of their clients. Open interest refers to the total number of contracts that are currently open,\u201d - in other words, contracts that have been traded but not yet liquidated by either an offsetting trade, exercise, expiration, or assignment. Open interest is also a measure of the future activity remaining to be closed out in terms of the number of contracts that members and their clients continue to hold in the particular contract and by the number of contracts held for each contract month listed by the exchange. The following charts and table present our year-end open interest for our futures and options contracts (in thousands, except for percentages):  Open Interest \n\nThe following charts and tables present selected cash and equity options trading data. All trading volume below is presented as average net daily trading volume and is single counted:\n\nHandled volume represents the total number of shares of equity securities, ETFs and crossing session activity internally matched on our exchanges or routed to and executed on an external market center. Matched volume represents the total number of shares of equity securities, ETFs and crossing session activity executed on our exchanges.\nFor NYSE cash equities, market share increased in 2018 due to increased equity market volatility, the commencement of trading on NYSE National and the acquisition of CHX. NYSE cash equities market share declined during 2017 due to historically low volatility driving more trading to off-exchange trading venues, particularly dark-pools. For NYSE equity options, 2018 market share improved due to greater equity market volatility and decreased in 2017 due to a strategic focus on maximizing revenues in an extremely competitive environment.\nTransaction-Based Expenses\nOur equities and equity options markets pay fees to the SEC pursuant to Section 31 of the Exchange Act. Section 31 fees are recorded on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue. These Section 31 fees are assessed to recover the government's costs of supervising and regulating the securities markets and professionals. We, in turn, collect corresponding activity assessment fees from member organizations clearing or settling trades on the equities and options exchanges, and recognize these amounts in our transaction and clearing revenues when invoiced. The activity assessment fees are designed to equal the Section 31 fees. As a result, activity assessment fees and the corresponding Section 31 fees do not have an impact on our net income, although the timing of payment by us may vary from collections. The fees we collect are included in cash at the time of receipt and we remit the amounts to the SEC semi-annually as required. The total amount is included in accrued liabilities and was $105 million as of December 31, 2018.\nWe make liquidity payments to cash and options trading customers, as well as routing charges made to other exchanges included in transaction-based expenses. We incur routing charges when we do not have the best bid or offer in the market for a security that a customer is trying to buy or sell on one of our securities exchanges. In that case, we route the customer's order to the external market center that displays the best bid or offer. The external market center charges us a fee per share (denominated in tenths of a cent per share) for routing to its system. We record routing charges on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue.\nOperating Expenses, Operating Income and Operating Margin\nOur Trading and Clearing segment operating expenses increased $130 million in 2018 from 2017, and decreased $45 million in 2017 from 2016, partially related to the $33 million Creditex customer relationship intangible asset impairment expense recorded in 2016. See - Consolidated Operating Expenses\u201d below for a discussion of the significant changes in our operating expenses. Our Trading and Clearing segment operating income increased $162 million in 2018 from 2017, and increased $71 million in 2017 from 2016. Trading and Clearing segment operating margins were 62%, 63% and 61% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The operating income increases in the last two years were driven by the revenue increases discussed above.\nOur Trading and Clearing segment adjusted operating expenses were $824 million, $714 million and $716 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our Trading and Clearing segment adjusted operating income was $1.6 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.4 billion in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our Trading and Clearing segment adjusted operating margins were 66% in 2018, 2017 and 2016. See - Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below.\nData and Listings Segment\nThe following charts and table present our selected statements of income data for our Data and Listings segment (dollars in millions):\n(1) The adjusted numbers in the charts above are calculated by excluding items that are not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. As a result, these adjusted numbers are not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. See - Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below.\n\nData Services Revenues\nOur Data and Listings segment represents subscription-based, or recurring, revenues from data services and listings services offered across our trading and clearing businesses and ICE Data Services. Through ICE Data Services, we generate revenues from a range of global financial and commodity markets, including pricing and reference data, exchange data, analytics, feeds, index services, desktops and connectivity solutions. Through NYSE, NYSE American and NYSE Arca, we generate listings revenue related to the provision of listings services for public companies and ETFs, and related corporate actions for listed companies.\nIn 2018, 2017 and 2016, 8%, 10% and 12%, respectively, of our Data and Listings segment revenues were billed in pounds sterling or euros (all relating to our data services revenues). As the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the U.S. equivalent of revenues denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly. Due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar compared to the pound sterling and euro during 2018, our data services revenues were higher by $7 million in 2018 than in 2017. Due to the weakening of the pound sterling and euro compared to the U.S. dollar during 2017, our data services revenues were lower by $8 million in 2017 than in 2016.\nOur data services revenues are primarily subscription-based and increased 1% in 2018 from 2017, and increased 5% in 2017 from 2016. The increases in revenues in both 2018 and 2017 were primarily due to the strong retention rate of\nexisting customers, the addition of new customers, increased purchases by existing customers and increases in pricing of our products, partially offset by the divestitures of IDMS in March 2017 and Trayport in December 2017 within our desktop and connectivity business. The increase in revenue in 2017 from 2016 was also partially due to our acquisitions of TMX Atrium in May 2017 and BofAML's Global Research division's index business in October 2017 and the impact of foreign currency translation.\n \u2022 Pricing and Analytics: Our pricing and analytics revenues increased 7% in 2018 from 2017 and increased 13% in 2017 from 2016. The increases in revenue were driven by the strong retention rate of existing customers, the addition of new customers, increased purchases by existing customers, increases in pricing of our products and the acquisition and further distribution of the ICE BofAML Indices. \n \u2022 Exchange Data and Feeds: Our exchange data and feeds revenues increased 6% in 2018 from 2017 and increased 5% in 2017 from 2016. The increases in revenues were driven by the strong retention rate of existing customers, the addition of new customers, increased purchases by existing customers and a larger share of the NMS Plan revenue. \n \u2022 Desktops and Connectivity: Our desktop and connectivity revenues decreased 17% in 2018 from 2017 and decreased 7% in 2017 from 2016 driven primarily by the divestitures of IDMS and Trayport in 2017.  Annual Subscription Value, or ASV, represents, at a point in time, the data services revenues subscribed for the succeeding 12 months. ASV does not include new sales, contract terminations or price changes that may occur during that 12-month period. ASV also does not include certain data services revenue streams that are not subscription-based. Revenue from ASV businesses has historically represented approximately 90% of our data revenues. Thus, while it is an indicative forward-looking metric, it does not provide a growth forecast of the next 12 months of data services revenues.\nAs of December 31, 2018, ASV was $1.922 billion, which increased 6.1% compared to the ASV as of December 31, 2017. This does not adjust for year-over-year foreign exchange fluctuations or impacts of acquisitions. Underpinning this growth is strength in our pricing & analytics business.\nListings Revenues\nListings revenues in our securities markets arise from fees applicable to companies listed on our cash equities exchanges - original listing fees and annual listing fees. Original listing fees consist of two components: initial listing fees and fees related to corporate actions. Initial listing fees, subject to a minimum and maximum amount, are based on the number of shares that a company initially lists. All listings fees are billed upfront and the identified performance obligations are satisfied over time. Revenue related to the investor relations performance obligation is recognized ratably over a two-year period, with the remaining revenue recognized ratably over time as customers continue to list on our exchanges, which is generally estimated to be over a period of up to nine years for NYSE and up to five years for NYSE Arca and NYSE American.\nIn addition, we earn corporate actions-related listing fees in connection with actions involving the issuance of new shares, such as stock splits, rights issues and sales of additional securities, as well as mergers and acquisitions. Listings fees related to other corporate actions are considered contract modifications of our listing contracts and are recognized ratably over time as customers continue to list on our exchanges, which is generally estimated to be a period of six years for NYSE and three years for NYSE Arca and NYSE American.\nOur listings revenues increased 4% in 2018 from 2017 and decreased 1% in 2017 from 2016 due to changes in market conditions for IPOs.\nOperating Expenses, Operating Income and Operating Margin\nOur Data and Listings segment operating expenses increased $7 million in 2018 from 2017, and decreased $36 million in 2017 from 2016. See - Consolidated Operating Expenses\u201d below for a discussion of the significant changes in our operating expenses. Our Data and Listings segment operating income increased $42 million in 2018 from 2017, and increased $136 million in 2017 from 2016. Our Data and Listings segment operating margins were 42%, 41% and 37% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The operating income and operating margin increases during 2018 and 2017 were driven by the revenue increases discussed above.\nOur Data and Listings segment adjusted operating expenses were $1.2 billion in 2018, 2017 and 2016. Our Data and Listings segment adjusted operating income was $1.3 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our Data and Listings segment adjusted operating margins were 51%, 51% and 49% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. See - Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below.\nConsolidated Operating Expenses\nThe following presents our consolidated operating expenses (dollars in millions):\n\nThe majority of our operating expenses do not vary directly with changes in our volume and revenues, except for certain technology and communication expenses and a portion of our compensation expense that is tied directly to our data sales or overall financial performance.\nWe expect our operating expenses to increase in absolute terms in future periods in connection with our acquisitions and growth of our business, and to vary from year-to-year based on the type and level of our acquisitions, our integrations and other investments.\nIn 2018, 2017 and 2016, 13%, 14% and 18%, respectively, of our operating expenses were incurred in pounds sterling or euros. Due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar compared to the pound sterling and euro in 2018, our consolidated operating expenses were higher by $12 million in 2018 than in 2017. Due to the weakening of the pound sterling and euro as compared to the U.S. dollar in 2017, our consolidated operating expenses were lower by $14 million in 2017 than in 2016. See Item 7(A) - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\u201d below for additional information.\nCompensation and Benefits Expenses\nCompensation and benefits expense is our most significant operating expense and includes non-capitalized employee wages, bonuses, non-cash or stock compensation, certain severance costs, benefits and employer taxes. The bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on both our financial performance and the individual employee performance. The performance-based restricted stock compensation expense is also based on our financial performance. Therefore, our compensation and benefits expense will vary year-to-year based on our financial performance and fluctuations in the number of employees.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had 5,161 employees, compared to 4,952 and 5,631 as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Our employee headcount increased in 2018 from 2017 primarily due to new employees related to the acquisitions of BondPoint in January 2018, CHX Holdings, Inc. and TMC Bonds in July 2018 and MERS in October 2018, partially offset by continued employee terminations associated with our integration of Interactive Data. Our employee headcount decreased in 2017 from 2016 primarily due to the divestitures in 2017 of IDMS, Trayport and NYSE Governance Services, and employee terminations in connection with our integration of Interactive Data, partially offset by new employees related to the acquisitions of ICE NGX and TMX Atrium in 2017. See - Recent Developments\u201d above.\nOur compensation and benefits expenses increased in 2018 from 2017 primarily due to employee severance and retention costs and a net increase in our employee headcount, partially offset by a decrease in non-cash compensation expense. We incurred employee severance and retention costs of $41 million, $21 million and $10 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in compensation and benefits expenses in 2017 from 2016 was minimal.\nNon-cash compensation expenses recognized in our consolidated financial statements for employee stock options and restricted stock were $130 million, $135 million and $123 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in non-cash compensation expenses in 2018 from 2017 was primarily related to a change in ICE's non-cash incentive plans that reduced the overall amount of non-cash incentives awarded. The increase in non-cash compensation expenses in 2017 from 2016 primarily relates to the integration of the Interactive Data employees into the ICE non-cash incentive plans.\nProfessional Services Expenses\nThis expense includes fees for consulting services received on strategic and technology initiatives, temporary labor, as well as regulatory, legal and accounting fees, and may fluctuate as a result of changes in consulting and technology services, temporary labor, and regulatory, accounting and legal proceedings.\nProfessional services expenses increased in 2018 from 2017 primarily due to consulting and legal fees related to software development consulting costs. Professional services expenses decreased in 2017 from 2016 primarily due to the continued reduction in professional services and contractors at NYSE. We eliminated or replaced certain contractor positions with full-time employees at NYSE in 2016. In addition, during 2016, we recorded a credit from a third-party service provider related to fees charged in a prior period. Legal fees, which are included in professional services expenses, primarily related to class action lawsuits in which NYSE was a defendant. These decreases were partially offset by professional services expenses incurred by Interactive Data, Trayport, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis.\nAcquisition-Related Transaction and Integration Costs\nIn 2018, we incurred $34 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, primarily relating to employee terminations and lease terminations in connection with our our integrations of Interactive Data, Securities Evaluations and\nCredit Market Analysis, professional services costs from our 2018 acquisitions, and a $5 million banker success fee in connection with our acquisition of TMC Bonds. The integration of Interactive Data was completed by June 30, 2018.\nIn 2017, we incurred $36 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, primarily relating to our integrations of Interactive Data, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis and our acquisitions of BondPoint, TMX Atrium, the ICE BofAML Indices and NYSE National. Of this amount, $11 million was primarily related to the acquisitions. We incurred $25 million for Interactive Data, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis integration costs relating to employee and lease termination costs and professional services costs.\nIn 2016, we incurred $80 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs primarily relating to our integrations of Interactive Data and NYSE, legal and professional fees related to the Trayport CMA review, our investment in MERS, our acquisitions of Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis, and various other potential and discontinued acquisitions. Of this amount, $41 million was primarily related to the acquisitions and other transaction costs. We incurred $39 million for Interactive Data and NYSE integration costs during 2016, primarily relating to employee and lease termination costs and professional services costs. The integration of NYSE was completed in 2016 and no NYSE integration costs were incurred after 2016.\nWe expect to continue to explore and pursue various potential acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our competitive position and support our growth. As a result, we may incur acquisition-related transaction costs in future periods. See - Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below.\nTechnology and Communication Expenses\nTechnology support services consist of costs for running our wholly-owned data centers, hosting costs paid to third-party data centers, and maintenance of our computer hardware and software required to support our technology and cybersecurity. These costs are driven by system capacity, functionality and redundancy requirements. Communication expenses consist of costs for network connection for our electronic platforms, telecommunications costs, and fees paid for access to external market data. This expense also includes licensing and other fee agreement expenses which may be impacted by growth in electronic contract volume, our capacity requirements, changes in the number of telecommunications hubs and connections with customers to access our electronic platforms directly.\nTechnology and communications expenses increased in 2018 from 2017, primarily due to $17 million in data center migrations, hardware support upgrades and cybersecurity investments, $11 million in increased costs related to our recent acquisitions, net of divestitures, and $7 million in increased costs for external market data content acquisition and revenue share agreements related to our product offering. Technology and communications expenses increased in 2017 from 2016, primarily due to $14 million in increased hardware support upgrades and cybersecurity investments, and $10 million in costs related to our recent acquisitions, net of divestitures.\nRent and Occupancy Expenses\nRent and occupancy expense relates to leased and owned property and includes rent, maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities and other related costs. We have significant operations located in and around Atlanta, New York and London with smaller offices located throughout the world. See Item 2 - Properties\u201d above for additional information regarding our leased and owned property.\nExcluding the impact of the acquisitions, rent and occupancy expenses decreased the last two years primarily due to reduced rent and occupancy costs realized from the continued consolidation of our Atlanta, New York and London office locations.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include marketing, advertising, public relations, insurance, bank service charges, dues and subscriptions, travel and entertainment, non-income taxes and other general and administrative costs.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased in 2018 from 2017, primarily due to $14 million in accruals relating to SEC investigations and inquiries made during 2017. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased in 2017 from 2016, primarily due to the acquisitions of Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis and $14 million in accruals relating to SEC investigations and inquiries. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and the SEC investigations and inquiries, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased the last two years primarily due to lower marketing expenses. Refer to Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for more information on the SEC investigations and inquiries.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses\nDepreciation and amortization expense results from depreciation of long-lived assets such as buildings, leasehold improvements, planes, furniture, fixtures and equipment over their estimated useful lives. This expense includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our acquisitions of businesses, as well as on various licensing agreements, over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of customer relationships, trading products with finite lives and technology. This expense also includes amortization of internally-developed and purchased software over its estimated useful life.\nWe recorded amortization expenses on intangible assets acquired as part of our acquisitions, as well as on other intangible assets, of $289 million, $272 million and $323 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Amortization expense increased in 2018 from 2017, as a result of ICE NGX, BondPoint, TMC Bonds, the ICE BofAML Indices, MERS and TMX Atrium intangible assets. In addition, in 2018, we recorded a $4 million impairment loss on exchange registration intangible assets related to our closure of ICE Futures Canada and ICE Clear Canada as amortization expense. This increase in amortization expense was partially offset by a decrease in amortization recorded on our Russell license intangible assets in 2018 from 2017 due to these assets becoming fully amortized, and amortization expense recorded in 2017 as a result of the net loss of $6 million on the sale of NYSE Governance Services.\nThe decrease in the amortization expenses recorded on the intangible assets in 2017 from 2016 is primarily due to a reduction in amortization expenses recorded on intangible assets which became fully amortized (primarily related to certain of the NYSE intangible assets) and the divestitures of Trayport and NYSE Governance Services, partially offset by amortization expenses recorded on the Securities Evaluations, Credit Market Analysis, ICE NGX and TMX Atrium intangible assets. In 2016, we recorded an impairment of the Creditex customer relationship intangible asset of $33 million, which was recorded in depreciation and amortization expenses. In 2016, we sold certain of Creditex's U.S. voice brokerage operations to Tullett Prebon and discontinued Creditex's U.K. voice brokerage operations. We continue to operate Creditex's electronically traded markets and systems, post-trade connectivity platforms and intellectual property.\nWe recorded depreciation expenses on our fixed assets of $293 million, $257 million and $254 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, with the increase in 2018 primarily due to depreciation resulting from increased software development.\nConsolidated Non-Operating Income (Expense)\nIncome and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered non-operating. The following tables present our non-operating income (expenses) (dollars in millions):\n\nInterest Income\nWe recognized interest income on our investments of $22 million, $8 million and $3 million during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Interest income increased in 2018 from 2017 primarily due to a rise in short-term interest rates on various investments.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased in 2018 from 2017, primarily due to an increase in the principal and coupon of our bond refinancing in August 2018, as well as a rise in short-term interest rates impacting our Commercial Paper Program. Interest expense increased in 2017 from 2016, primarily due to interest expense that we recognized relating to our bond refinancing in August 2017, partially offset by the September 2017 repayment of $850 million of 2.00% senior unsecured fixed rate notes that were due in October 2017. See - Debt\u201d below.\nOther income, net\nIn December 2017, we sold Trayport to TMX Group for \u00a3550 million ($733 million). We recognized a net gain of $110 million on the divestiture of Trayport, which was recorded as other income in 2017.\nIn connection with Cetip's merger with BM&FBOVESPA S.A., now B3, and its subsequent sale, we recognized a $176 million realized investment gain in other income in 2017 and $9 million in foreign exchange losses and transaction expenses in other expense in 2017. We recognized dividend income received relating to our investment in Cetip in other income, which was $5 million and $17 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. We no longer receive dividends from Cetip subsequent to its sale in the first quarter of 2017.\nWe account for our investments in The Options Clearing Corporation, or OCC, and MERS until our October 2018 acquisition of MERS, as equity method investments. We recognized $46 million, $36 million and $25 million in equity income related to these investments during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as other income. Prior to October 2018, we owned a majority stake in MERS and treated it as an equity method investment because we did not have the ability to control its operations. On October 3, 2018, we completed the purchase of all remaining interests of MERS and subsequently own 100% of MERS. On that date, we gained control of MERS, began to include MERS's results as part of our consolidated operations and recognized a $110 million gain on our initial investment value in MERS as other income. MERS is now part of ICE Mortgage Services.\nIn connection with our equity investment in Euroclear, we recognized dividend income of $15 million in 2018, which is included in other income.\nIn connection with our adoption of ASU 2017-07, we are recognizing the other components of net benefit cost of our defined\nbenefit plans in the income statement as non-operating income on a full retrospective basis. The combined net periodic (expense) benefit of these plans was ($8 million) and $9 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nWe incurred foreign currency transaction losses of $2 million, $4 million and $1 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This was primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency gains and losses are recorded in other income, net, when the settlement of foreign currency assets, liabilities and payables that occur through our foreign operations that are received in non-functional currencies due to the increase or decrease in the period-end foreign currency exchange rates between periods.
