Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified entirely by, our consolidated financial statements (including Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and the other consolidated financial information appearing elsewhere in this report. Some of the information in this discussion and analysis includes forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. Actual results and timing of events could differ from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nThe following discussion and analysis omits discussion of fiscal year 2017. Please see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 for a discussion of fiscal year 2017.\nOverview\nWe are a holding company seeking to acquire assets and businesses, where our people and other assets provide a competitive advantage. We currently have four business operating segments: durable medical equipment, investment management, real estate, and general corporate.\nFor additional information see Item 1. Business.\u201d\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. These items are monitored and analyzed by our management for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future.\nAccounts Receivable\nSubstantially all of the accounts receivable balance relates to the durable medical equipment business. Accounts receivable are customer obligations due under normal sales and rental terms and represent the amount estimated to be collected from the patient customers and, if applicable, the third-party private insurance provider or government program (collectively, Payors), based on the contractual agreements. The Company does not require collateral in connection with its customer transactions and aside from verifying insurance coverage, does not perform credit checks on patient customers. Revenue and accounts receivable have been constrained to the extent that billed amounts exceed the amounts estimated to be collected. The constrained transaction price relates primarily to expected billing adjustments with the Payors and patient customers. Management's evaluation of variable consideration takes into account such factors as past experience, information about specific receivables, Payors and patient customers.\nThe assessment of variable consideration to be constrained is based on estimates, and ultimate losses may vary from current estimates. As adjustments to these estimates become necessary, they are reported in earnings in the periods in which they become known. Changes in constraints on variable consideration are recorded as a component of net revenues.\nThe Company generally does not allow returns from providers for reasons not covered under the manufacturer's standard warranty. Therefore, there is no provision for sales return reserves. The Company does not have significant bad debt experience with Payors, and therefore does not maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts.\nFair Value Measurements\nCertain assets and liabilities are carried at fair value under US GAAP. This includes the Company's contingent consideration liability related to the initial durable medical equipment acquisition which is fair valued using unobservable inputs, including volatility, weighted-average cost of capital and related EBITDA forecasts of the acquired businesses. These unobservable inputs are classified as level 3 under the fair value hierarchy within US GAAP.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of fair value over identifiable tangible and intangible net assets acquired in business combinations. Goodwill is not amortized. Instead goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually, or on an interim basis between annual tests when events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. We perform our annual impairment test on the first day of the fiscal fourth quarter. The Company's $50.4 million of goodwill was acquired in conjunction with the acquisitions of the durable medical equipment businesses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 and at the time of recognition the fair value of such goodwill was equal to its carrying value. This goodwill has been recorded within our durable medical equipment reporting unit. Based on our annual impairment test as of April 1, 2019 the fair value of the durable medical equipment reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by 14.5% and no impairment occurred. The fair value of this reporting unit was derived using a combination of present value of estimated cash flows and the valuations and prices of comparable businesses. The discount rate used in this analysis was 14.0%.\nDurable Medical Equipment Revenue\nEquipment Sales and Services Revenues\nThe Company sells durable medical equipment, replacement parts and supplies to customers and recognizes revenue at the point control is transferred through delivery to the customer. Each piece of equipment, part or supply is distinct and separately priced thus they each represent a single performance obligation. The revenue is allocated amongst the performance obligations based upon the relative standalone selling price method, however, items are typically all delivered or supplied together. The customer and, if applicable, the Payors are generally charged at the time that the product is sold, although separate layers of insurance coverage may need to be invoiced before final billings may occur.\nThe Company also provides sleep study services to customers and recognizes revenue when the results of the sleep study are complete as that is when the performance obligation is met.\nThe transaction price on both equipment sales and sleep studies is the amount that the Company expects to receive in exchange for the goods and services provided. Due to the nature of the durable medical equipment business, billing adjustments customarily occur during the collections process when explanations of benefits are received by Payors, and as amounts are deferred to secondary Payors or to patient responsibility. As such, we constrain the transaction price for the difference between the amounts billed and what we believe we will collect from Payors and from patients. The transaction price therefore is predominantly based on contractual payment rates determined by the Payors. The Company does not generally contract with uninsured customers. We determine our estimates of billing adjustments based upon contractual agreements, our policies and historical experience. While the rates are fixed for the product or service with the customer and the Payors, such amounts typically include co-payments, co-insurance and deductibles, which vary in amounts, from the patient customer. The Company includes in the transaction price only the amount that the Company expects to be entitled, which is substantially all of the Payor billings at contractual rates. Due to the fact that we do not typically perform credit checks on patient customers aside from verifying insurance coverage, the transaction price is initially constrained by the amount of customer co-payments we estimate will not be collected.\nDue to the nature of the industry and the reimbursement environment in which the Company operates, certain estimates are required to record net revenue and accounts receivable at their net realizable values. Inherent in these estimates is the risk that they will have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available. Specifically, the complexity of many third-party billing arrangements and the uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for certain services from certain Payors may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded. Such adjustments are typically identified and recorded at the point of cash application or claim denial. There were no material changes in estimates recorded in the year ended June 30, 2019, relating to prior periods.\nThe payment terms and conditions of customer contracts vary by customer type and the products and services offered.\nThe Company may provide shipping services prior to the point of delivery and has concluded that the services represent a fulfilment activity and not a performance obligation. Returns and refunds are not accepted on either equipment sales or sleep study services. The Company does not offer warranties to customers in excess of the manufacturer's warranty. Any taxes due upon sale of the products or services are not recognized as revenue. The Company does not incur contract acquisition costs.\nIncluded in sales and services revenue are unbilled amounts for which the revenue recognition criteria had been met as of period-end but were not yet billed to the Payor. The estimate of net unbilled sales and service revenue recognized is based on historical trends and estimates of future collectability.\nEquipment Rental Revenue\nUnder FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, Leases, (Topic 842) rental income from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis, based on contractual lease terms with fixed and determinable increases over the non-cancellable term of the related lease when collectability is reasonably assured. The Company leases durable medical equipment to customers for a fixed monthly amount on a month-to-month basis. The contractual length of the lease term varies based on the type of equipment that is rented to the customer, but generally is from 10 to 36-months. In the case of capped rental agreements, title to the equipment transfers to the customer at the end of the contractual rental period. The customer has the right to cancel the lease at any time during the rental period for a subsequent month's rental and payments are generally billed in advance on a month-to-month basis. Under Topic 842, rental income from operating leases is recognized on a month-to-month basis, based on contractual lease terms when collectability is reasonably assured. Certain customer co-payments are included in revenue when considered probable of payment, which is generally when paid.\nThe lease term begins on the date products are delivered to patients and are recorded at amounts estimated to be received under reimbursement arrangements with third-party payors, including Medicare, private payors, and Medicaid. Due to the nature of the industry and the reimbursement environment in which the Company operates, certain estimates are required to record net revenue and accounts receivable at their net realizable values. Inherent in these estimates is the risk that they will have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available. Specifically, the complexity of many third-party billing arrangements and the uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for certain services from certain Payors may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded. Such adjustments are typically identified and recorded at the point of cash application or claim denial. There were no material changes in estimates recorded in the year ended June 30, 2019, relating to prior periods.\nAlthough invoicing typically occurs at the beginning of the monthly rental period, we recognize revenue from rentals on a daily basis. Since rental agreements can commence at any time during a given month, we defer revenue related to the remaining monthly rental period as of period end.\nIncluded in rental revenue are unbilled amounts for which the revenue recognition criteria had been met as of period-end but were not yet billed to the Payor. The estimate of net unbilled rental revenue recognized is based on historical trends and estimates of future collectability.\nInvestment Management Revenue\nThe Company recognizes revenue from its investment management business at amounts that reflect the consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for providing services to its customer. Investment management revenue primarily consists of fees based on a percentage of assets under management; fees based on the performance of managed assets; and administrative fees; as follows:\nManagement Fees\nThe Company earns management fees based on the investment management agreement GECM has with GECC. The performance obligation is satisfied over time as the services are rendered, since GECC simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided as GECM performs services. Under GECC's investment management agreement with GECM, the base management fee from GECC is calculated at an annual rate of 1.50% of GECC's average adjusted gross assets. The base management fee is calculated based on the average value of GECC's gross assets, excluding cash and cash equivalents, at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. Management fees are billed quarterly in arrears.\nIncentive Fees\nThe Company earns incentive fees based on the investment management agreements GECM has with GECC and separately managed accounts. Where an investment management agreement includes both management fees and incentive fees, the performance obligation is considered to be a single obligation for both fees. Incentive fees are variable consideration associated with the GECC investment management agreement. Incentive fees are recognized based on investment performance during the period, subject to the achievement of minimum return levels or high-water marks, in accordance with the terms of the respective investment management agreements. Incentive fees range from 5.0% to 20.0%. Because of the uncertainty of when incentive fees will be collected due to market conditions and investment performance, incentive fees are fully constrained and not recorded until received and the probability of significant reversal of the fees is eliminated in accordance with the respective investment management agreements.\nAdministration Fees\nThe Company earns administration fees based on the administration agreement GECM has with GECC whereby GECC reimburses GECM for costs incurred in performing administrative functions for GECC. This revenue is recognized over time as the services are performed. Administrative fees are billed quarterly in arrears, which is consistent with the timing of the delivery of services and reflect agreed upon rates for the services provided. The services are accounted for as a single performance obligation that is a series of distinct services with substantially the same pattern of transfer as the services are provided on a daily basis.\nReal Estate Revenue\nRental Revenue\nConsistent with the leases of durable medical equipment, the Company recognizes rental revenue on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable term of the lease. Under the terms of the lease, the Company may recover from the tenant certain expenses, including: insurance and other operating expenses. For all expenses that are paid by the Company and reimbursed by the tenant, the recovery of these expenses is recognized in rental income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, in the same periods as the expenses are incurred. These expenses recognized in both revenue and expense may fluctuate from period to period based on actual expense amounts.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when necessary in order to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be recovered.\nThe Company has established a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets that are not recoverable from taxable temporary differences because the Company is unable to conclude that future utilization of a portion of its NOL carryforwards and other deferred tax assets is more likely than not.\nThe calculation of the Company's tax positions involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in several different state tax jurisdictions. The Company is periodically reviewed by tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These reviews include inquiries regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. The Company records estimated reserves for exposures associated with positions that it takes on its income tax returns that do not meet the more likely than not standards.\nBusiness Combinations\nBusiness combinations are accounted for at fair value. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses; previously held equity interests are valued at fair value upon the acquisition of a controlling interest; restructuring costs associated with a business combination are expensed subsequent to the acquisition date; and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date affect income tax expense. Measurement period adjustments are made in the period in which the amounts are determined and the current period income effect of such adjustments will be calculated as if the adjustments had been completed as of the acquisition date. All changes that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are also included in current period earnings. The accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business, and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, in determining the estimated fair value for assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration, are based on management's estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates, the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill, require acceleration of the amortization expense of finite-lived intangible assets, or the recognition of additional consideration which would be expensed. The fair value of contingent consideration is remeasured each period based on relevant information and changes to the fair value are included in the operating results for the period.\nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion is reflective of our four business operating segments: durable medical equipment, investment management, real estate and general corporate. Real estate and durable medical equipment commenced operations in March and September 2018, respectively. Correspondingly, the results of operations for the period ended June 30, 2019 for each of these segments is not comparable to the corresponding periods ended June 30, 2018.\nThe following table

durable medical equipment business, $3.8 million from the investment management business and $5.5 million from the real estate business, while revenues for the year ended June 30, 2018 included $4.1 million from the investment management business and $1.9 million from the real estate business. Revenues from the year ended June 30, 2017 included $4.9 million from the investment management business. The increase in total revenue for the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the years ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017 are primarily attributable to the acquisition of the real estate business in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 and the acquisition of the durable medical equipment business in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.\nOperating costs and expenses\nThe increase in operating costs for the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to the additional costs associated with the durable medical equipment business, including cost of goods sold and cost of rentals, as well as the general and administrative costs of the durable medical equipment business, depreciation on fixed assets and amortization of the intangible assets associated with the durable medical equipment business. The increase in operating costs for the year ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2017 is primarily attributable to increased compensation costs in connection with the investment management business. In addition, for the year ended June 30, 2017, the general corporate business received a one-time reimbursement associated with the formation of GECC of approximately $3.0 million resulting in lower expenses for that year.\nOther income (expense)\nInterest expense increased for the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2018 due to increased borrowings related to our acquisitions in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 and in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. Interest expense decreased for the year ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2017 due to additional costs incurred in retiring senior notes during the 2017 fiscal year. Other income and expense primarily consisted of dividend income and unrealized gains or losses on the Company's investment in GECC and interest income earned on cash balances.\nDurable Medical Equipment\nThe key metrics of our durable medical equipment business include:\nTable 117: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25aa\n</td> <td> Patients and setup growth - which drives revenue growth and takes advantage of scalable operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25aa\n</td> <td> Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table provides the results of our durable medical equipment business for the period from its inception in September 2018 to June 30, 2019 (the DME inception period). We began to operate the durable medical equipment business in September 2018 and thus there are no comparable results prior to that date.\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the period September 7, 2018 to June 30, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 41,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating costs and expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11,463\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of rentals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,798\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transaction costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (551\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (20,260\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,323\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (39,395\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,415\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (177\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,592\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total pre-tax income (loss) from continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,107\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDurable Medical Equipment Revenue\nFor the DME inception period, durable medical equipment revenue consisted of $27.3 million in sales of medical equipment and sleep study services and $14.6 million in rentals of medical equipment.\nDurable Medical Equipment Costs and Expenses\nCost of goods sold includes inventory costs for medical equipment sold and direct costs associated with running sleep study services, including staff compensation to perform the studies and the purchase of supplies used in the studies. For the DME inception period, cost of rentals included $5.6 million of depreciation on medical equipment held for lease with the remaining costs related to maintenance expenses.\nOther selling, general and administrative expenses for the DME inception period included approximately $14.4 million of payroll and related costs, $1.5 million of rental expenses associated with facility and equipment leases, and other administrative costs. In addition, the Company incurred transaction costs of $0.6 million for the DME inception period in connection with the acquisition of the durable medical equipment businesses. Depreciation and amortization includes the depreciation of fixed assets, excluding depreciation on the equipment held for rental, which is included in the cost of rentals, and amortization of the intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of the durable medical equipment businesses.\nIn addition to the operating costs and expenses, we recognized interest expense of $3.4 million for the DME inception period. Other income (expense) for the DME inception period ended June 30, 2019 includes dividend income of $0.7 million and realized loss of $0.9 million for the portion of the investment in GECC which had been restricted in connection with the Great Elm DME Holdings, Inc. (DME Holdings) preferred shares issued at inception of the durable medical equipment business in September 2018 (see Note 13 - Non-Controlling Interests and Preferred Stock of Subsidiary in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In addition, management and monitoring expenses, which are payable to Great Elm DME Manager, LLC (DME Manager), a subsidiary of the Company in the general corporate segment, and one of the former owners of the durable medical equipment businesses, are included in other expense.\nInvestment Management\nThe key metrics of our investment management business include:\nTable 120: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25aa\n</td> <td> Assets under management - which provides the basis on which our management fees and performance milestones for vesting of certain equity awards are based\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25aa\n</td> <td> Investment performance - on which our incentive fees (if any) are based and on which we are measured against our competition\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table provides the results of our investment management business for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018:\nTable 122: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the years ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,841\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating costs and expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (521\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (85\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,487\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consulting agreement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (763\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (688\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,741\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (32\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,031\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (631\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (585\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,656\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,791\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (815\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,706\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (180\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (17\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (217\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (180\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (204\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total pre-tax income (loss) from continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (995\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (4,910\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Investment management revenues are net of incentive fee reversals determined based upon a hypothetical liquidation of net assets at period end.

For the year ended June 30, 2018, investment management revenues also included incentive fees from the management of GECC. As a result of the adoption of Topic 606 on July 1, 2018, incentive fees were not recognized for the year ended June 30, 2019. See Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFor the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, we recognized $3.0 million and $2.6 million, respectively, of management fee revenue and $0.9 million and $1.3 million, respectively, of administration fee revenue. The increase in management fee revenue for the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to an increase in the average assets on which such fees are calculated. Administration fees for the year ended June 30, 2018 included one-time costs associated with organizational restructuring and staffing changes at the Company which increased the costs on which the administration fees are based.\nInvestment Management Costs and Expenses\nOther general and administrative costs consist primarily of payroll and related costs, excluding stock-based compensation, professional fees, facilities and other overhead costs. For the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, facilities costs were $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively. The year over year decrease is primarily attributable to the Company moving to lower cost office space in October of 2017, as well as growth of the general corporate business resulting in lower allocation of shared expenses for the investment management business. Other overhead costs have remained consistent at approximately $0.3 million for each year.\nProfessional fees were less than $0.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2019; however, for the year ended June 30, 2018, professional fees were $0.2 million as a result of non-recurring costs incurred in connection with the September 2017 separation from MAST Capital (MAST Separation).\nFor the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, payroll and related costs, excluding stock-based compensation, were approximately $2.3 million and $3.2 million, respectively. The decrease in payroll and related costs for the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to the growth of the Company resulting in approximately $0.8 million in allocations of certain management personnel costs to the other business segments.\nThe decrease in stock-based compensation for the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to certain non-recurring costs recognized in connection with the MAST Separation. These non-recurring costs include:\nTable 124: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25aa\n</td> <td> the elimination of the vesting provisions and call rights for the GECC GP Corp. stock owned by certain employees of the Company resulting in stock-based compensation expense equal to the estimated fair value of the non-controlling interest in GECC GP Corp. held by those employees of $1.5 million; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25aa\n</td> <td> the restructuring of compensation arrangements for remaining employees resulting in higher stock-based compensation awarded in lieu of reductions in salaries for those employees. For the year ended June 30, 2019 these increases were partially offset by reversals of previously accrued stock-based compensation due to updated estimates related to the vesting criteria for certain performance-based awards.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGECM has a consulting agreement with a third party to provide services in exchange for 26% of the fees earned from the management of GECC, excluding incentive fees. The increase in the costs associated with this consulting agreement for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 are consistent with the corresponding increases in management fee revenue for the same periods.\nReal Estate\nThe key metrics of our real estate business include rental revenues, depreciation on rental properties and interest expense on the related debt.\nThe following table provides the results of our real estate business for the year ended June 30, 2019 and the period from its inception in March 2018 to June 30, 2018 (the RE inception period):\nTable 126: <table> <tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the year ended June 30, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the period March 6, 2018 to June 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating costs and expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (884\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (375\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,729\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (538\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,613\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (913\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,846\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,655\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (854\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,655\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (854\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total pre-tax income (loss) from continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nReal Estate Revenue\nFor the year ended June 30, 2019 and the RE inception period, we recognized $5.5 million and $1.9 million of rental revenue in connection with our recently acquired Class A office buildings in Fort Myers, Florida. The increase in revenue is due to having a full year of operations for the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to approximately four months for the RE inception period.\nReal Estate Costs and Expenses\nOur real estate business' costs primarily consist of management fees, insurance and state sales tax, depreciation of real estate assets and the amortization of the in-place lease intangible assets. For the year ended June 30, 2019 and the RE inception period depreciation was $1.2 million and $0.4 million, respectively, and amortization was $0.5 million and $0.2 million, respectively. In addition, we incurred $2.7 million and $0.9 million, respectively, of interest expense in connection with the Senior Note and Subordinated Note (each as defined herein) for the year ended June 30, 2019 and the RE inception period. Increases in the current year as compared to the prior period are due to having a full year of operations.\nGeneral Corporate\nThe following table provides the results of our general corporate business for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018:\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the years ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating costs and expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (457\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (51\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (938\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transaction costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,582\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,136\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,904\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,625\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,943\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,700\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,820\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,700\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1276\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (143\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (143\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total pre-tax income (loss) from continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (7,138\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (6,843\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral Corporate Revenue\nFor the year ended June 30, 2019, all revenue was derived from fees earned by DME Manager, which provides consulting services to DME Inc. Both DME Manager and DME Inc. were formed in connection with the acquisition of the durable medical equipment businesses in September 2018 and there was no corresponding activity prior to this acquisition.\nGeneral Corporate Costs and Expenses\nOur general and administrative costs primarily consisted of professional fees, payroll and facility costs for our finance, legal and other administrative functions as well as professional fees and payroll costs in connection with our diligence efforts towards identifying asset and business acquisition opportunities. For the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, professional fees in relation to the diligence of such opportunities were $1.6 million and $1.1 million, respectively. The increase in such professional fees for the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2018 was primarily driven by the significant acquisition of our durable medical equipment business in September 2018.\nThe increase in other general and administrative costs for the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the prior year was primarily driven by an increase of approximately $1.0 million in professional fees for external audit and other accounting advisory services and approximately $0.6 million in additional payroll and related costs, excluding stock-based compensation. The increases in payroll and related costs were partially offset by the $0.5 million reduction in stock-based compensation for the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2018.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther income and expense primarily consisted of dividend income and unrealized gains or losses on the Company's investment in GECC and interest income earned on cash balances. Dividend income for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 was $1.7 million and $2.4 million, respectively. During the year ended June 30, 2019, a portion of the Company's investment in GECC had been allocated to the durable medical equipment segment due to collateral requirements of the related party qualified preferred shares issued by DME Holdings in connection with the acquisition of the durable medical equipment businesses. This resulted in a decrease of $0.6 million in dividend income for the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the dividend income for the year ended June 30, 2018.\nWe recognized unrealized losses of $0.2 million and $2.7 million, respectively, for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. We mark-to-market our investment in GECC by reference to the closing price of GECC common stock on Nasdaq as of each period end.\nIncome Taxes\nAlthough in the aggregate we expect to owe no federal taxes for the year ended June 30, 2019, we are required to provide intra period taxes allocated between continuing operations and discontinued operations. During 2019, the Company recognized an income tax benefit with respect to discontinued operations of $1.3 million related to intraperiod allocations. In addition, the Company recognized an income tax benefit with respect to deferred tax liabilities of $0.9 million acquired in the durable medical equipment acquisition. State and local taxes were approximately $0.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2019.\nSummary of Discontinued Operations\nOn June 30, 2016, the Company sold two of its previously wholly-owned subsidiaries (the Divestiture) engaged in the patent licensing business for an aggregate purchase price of up to $40 million. The purchaser paid the Company $30 million, plus certain adjustments, upon the closing of the Divestiture, and had made claims that it had incurred indemnifiable losses in excess of the remaining $10 million due under the purchase and sale agreement.\nOn January 21, 2019, we entered into a mutual release and settlement agreement with the purchaser resulting in the release of any indemnifiable liabilities and an incremental cash receipt of $1.5 million. Prior to the execution of this settlement, the Company had determined that a loss related to final settlement with the purchaser was not realizable or estimable, and therefore had not accrued for any losses; however, the recognition of a portion of proceeds received associated with the former patent licensing business had been deferred pending finalization of all contingencies. The settlement resulted in a $5.0 million gain in discontinued operations during the year ended June 30, 2019, consisting of the extinguishment of related liabilities of $3.6 million and the receipt of cash of $1.5 million from the purchaser, partially offset by legal fees of $0.1 million. The net income from discontinued operations includes these gains, offset by a tax provision of $1.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2019.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the Company's discontinued operations for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018:\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the years ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Discontinued operations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Extinguishment of liabilities related to discontinued operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative expenses(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (87\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (165\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pretax gain (loss) from discontinued operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (165\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax benefit (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,285\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net gain (loss) from discontinued operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,736\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (165\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> During the year ended June 30, 2018, we incurred discontinued operating costs of $0.2 million related to the representations and warranties associated with the disposal of our legacy patent licensing business.\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Revenues\nAs a result of the settlement during the year ended June 30, 2019, we recognized $1.5 million in net revenues for the period.

If we are unsuccessful at raising additional capital resources, through either debt or equity, it is unlikely we will be able execute our strategic growth plan. See Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nCash Provided by or Used in Operating Activities. Cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $2.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. Cash flows used in operating activities totaled $3.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2018.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2019, net cash provided by operating activities for continuing operations consisted primarily of the net loss of $3.1 million and gain on discontinued operations of $3.7 million offset by non-cash activity, including $9.2 million of depreciation and amortization. Changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in net cash used in operating activities of $3.0 million, primarily consisting of an increase in accounts receivable of $2.8 million and decrease in operating leases of $1.1 million offset by increases in related party payables of $0.8 million. These changes in operating assets and liabilities are primarily related to operational changes as a result of the acquisition of our durable medical equipment businesses during the year.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2018, net cash used in operating activities consisted primarily of the following revenues and expenses: $4.1 million of investment management revenue received; $1.9 million of real estate revenue received; $4.3 million of cash based compensation and benefits paid to our employees; $1.4 million of costs incurred in the investigation and diligence of acquisition opportunities; $1.7 million of professional fees incurred; $0.4 million of real estate administrative expenses; $0.7 million of consulting fees and $0.8 million of rental and insurance expenses.\nCash Used in Investing Activities. Cash flows used in investing activities totaled $54.9 million and $2.4 million for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. For the year ended June 30, 2019 investing activities primarily consist of $48.1 million spent in the acquisitions of our durable medical equipment businesses in September 2018 and June 2019, as well as the purchase of $6.8 million in equipment held for rental and another $0.8 million in fixed assets related to the durable medical equipment business.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2018, investing activities primarily relate to the acquisition of our initial real estate assets.\nCash Provided by Financing Activities. Cash flows provided by financing activities totaled $21.5 million and $3.9 million for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. For the year ended June 30, 2019, cash inflows of approximately $19.9 million and $6.6 million were provided by net proceeds on the note payable from a seller and a revolving line of credit, respectively, established with the acquisition of the durable medical equipment business, including additional draws made during the year. Additionally, $1.6 million was provided by proceeds from equipment financing arrangements and $1.4 million was provided by the exercise of warrants in July 2018. These inflows were partially offset by principal payments of $2.8 million on our long term debt and related party notes payable, as well as $5.1 million paid to redeem the preferred stock of a subsidiary during the year ended June 30, 2019.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2018, financing activities primarily related to the exercise of warrants resulting in cash proceeds of $4.6 million and the issuance of 1,266,000 shares of our common stock. This cash inflow was partially offset by payments made on the Senior Note payable related to our real estate business of $0.6 million.\nBorrowings\nAs of June 30, 2019, we had a note due to a non-controlling interest holder of DME Inc., Corbel Capital Partners SBIC, L.P., totaling $27.6 million that accrues interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 10.0% (at June 30, 2019, the effective interest rate was 12.32%) through maturity on August 31, 2023 (the Corbel Facility). The Corbel Facility requires quarterly interest payments along with principal payments of $0.3 million plus an additional amount based on excess cash flows, if any, generated by the durable medical equipment business operations. The Corbel Facility is secured by all of the assets of the durable medical equipment business and the Company is required to meet certain financial covenants.\nThe Company has the option to prepay the borrowings outstanding under the Corbel Facility in whole or in part subject to certain prepayment penalties ranging from 1.0% - 5.0% of the early payment of the principal, based on the time that the Corbel Facility has been outstanding through the first five years of the loan.\nDME Inc. is required to pay to Corbel, as agent of the Corbel Facility, a quarterly monitoring fee of $25,000 per quarter while the borrowings remain outstanding. In addition, if the borrowing is repaid with proceeds of debt in full or in part at any time within the first three years from the date of issuance, the borrower shall pay an additional fee to the agent, ranging from 2.10% to 3.50% depending on the date of repayment based on the period outstanding, of the aggregate repaid principal amount.\nAs of June 30, 2019, we had a credit facility due to Pacific Mercantile Bank totaling $7.4 million that accrues interest at the prime rate plus 0.40% (at June 30, 2019, the effective rate was 5.90%) through maturity on August 30, 2020 (the DME Revolver). The DME Revolver allows for borrowings up to $10 million. The DME Revolver requires monthly interest payments. The DME Revolver is secured by all of the assets of the durable medical equipment business and the Company is required to meet certain financial covenants.\nThe Corbel Facility and DME Revolver each include covenants that restrict DME Inc. business operations to its current business, limit additional indebtedness, liens, asset dispositions and investments, require compliance and maintenance of licenses and government approvals and other customary conditions. Events of default include the failure to pay amounts when due, bankruptcy, or violation of covenants, including a change in control of DME Inc. DME Inc. must also comply with a fixed-charge coverage and leverage ratio financial covenants, which are based in part on the DME Inc. EBITDA levels.\nAs of June 30, 2019, we had a related party note due to MAST Capital (the GP Corp. Note) totaling $3.1 million that accrues interest at a variable rate of three-month LIBOR plus 3.0%, as adjusted for each 90-day period (at June 30, 2019, the effective rate was 5.32%) through maturity on November 3, 2026. The GP Corp. Note requires minimum annual principal payments of $0.08 million and quarterly interest-only payments. The GP Corp. Note is secured by the profit sharing agreement between GECM and GECC GP Corp. (the Profit Sharing Agreement) that transfers profits generated by our management of GECC, with no recourse to any of our other assets, entities or operations.\nThe GP Corp. Note is non-recourse to any of the Company's operations or net assets not related to GECM's management services to GECC. The GP Corp. Note may be prepaid at par value at any time with prior written notice to the holders of the GP Corp. Note. Additionally, GECC GP Corp. is required to prepay the GP Corp. Note upon certain material liquidation transactions including any termination of the Profit Sharing Agreement.\nAs of June 30, 2019, we had a senior note due to Wells Fargo Bank Northwest, National totaling $52.2 million that accrues interest at a rate of 3.49% through maturity on March 15, 2030 (the Senior Note). The Senior Note requires monthly principal and interest payments through the maturity date. The Senior Note is secured by a first lien mortgage on the Property and an Assignment of Leases and Rents, with no recourse to any of our assets, entities or operations.\nThe principal and interest due on the Senior Note may be prepaid at the option of the borrower, based on an amount determined by discounting the remaining principal and interest payments at a rate equal to an applicable premium in excess of a rate corresponding to the specified U.S. Treasury security over the remaining average life of the Senior Note.\nAs of June 30, 2019, we had a subordinated note due to Wells Fargo Bank Northwest, National totaling $3.3 million that accrues interest at a rate of 15.00% through maturity on March 15, 2030 (the Subordinated Note). The Subordinated Note is a capital appreciation note, whereby the monthly interest is capitalized to the principal balance and due at maturity. The Subordinated Note is secured by a second lien mortgage on the Property, and an Assignment of Leases and Rents, with no recourse to any of our assets, entities or operations.\nThe principal and interest due on the Subordinated Note may be prepaid at the option of the borrower, based on an amount determined by discounting the remaining principal and interest payments at a rate equal to an applicable premium in excess of a rate corresponding to the specified U.S. Treasury security over the remaining average life of the Subordinated Note.\nThe note agreements for both the Senior Note and the Subordinated Note include negative covenants that restrict the Company's majority-owned subsidiary, CRIC IT Fort Myers LLC's (the Property Owner) business operations to ownership and lease of the Property, limit additional indebtedness, require maintenance of insurance and other customary requirements related to the Property. Events of default include non-payment of amounts when due, inability to pay indebtedness or material change in the business operations or financial condition of the Property Owner or the lease tenant that in the lender's reasonable determination would reasonably be expected to materially impair the value of the Property, prevent timely repayment of the notes or performance of any material obligations under the note and related agreements. The payments under the notes are also guaranteed on a full and several basis by the non-controlling interest holder of the Property Owner. Both the Senior Note and Subordinated Note are non-recourse to the Company, but are secured by the Property, the rights associated with the leases and the stock owned by the Company in the Property Owner.\nBeginning in April 2019, DME Inc's operating subsidiaries also utilize equipment financing debt to fund certain inventory and equipment purchases from suppliers. These equipment financing debt agreements are entered into with 3rd party banks and are generally payable in equal installments over terms of one to three years, depending on the nature of the underlying purchases being financed. The debt is secured by the inventory and equipment, as applicable, of the operating subsidiaries entering into the agreements, and the long-term agreements have implicit interest rates between 7 - 8%. During the year ended June 30, 2019, the Company financed $1.6 million in inventory and equipment through such financing agreements.\nContractual Obligations\nOur contractual obligations as of June 30, 2019 are presented in the table below:\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments due by period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corbel Facility(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 40,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,618\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,889\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> DME Revolver(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,919\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> GP Corp.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified entirely by, our consolidated financial statements (including Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and the other consolidated financial information appearing elsewhere in this report. Some of the information in this discussion and analysis includes forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. Actual results and timing of events could differ from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nThe following discussion and analysis omits discussion of fiscal year 2017. Please see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 for a discussion of fiscal year 2017.\nOverview\nWe are a holding company seeking to acquire assets and businesses, where our people and other assets provide a competitive advantage. We currently have four business operating segments: durable medical equipment, investment management, real estate, and general corporate.\nFor additional information see Item 1. Business.\u201d\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. These items are monitored and analyzed by our management for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future.\nAccounts Receivable\nSubstantially all of the accounts receivable balance relates to the durable medical equipment business. Accounts receivable are customer obligations due under normal sales and rental terms and represent the amount estimated to be collected from the patient customers and, if applicable, the third-party private insurance provider or government program (collectively, Payors), based on the contractual agreements. The Company does not require collateral in connection with its customer transactions and aside from verifying insurance coverage, does not perform credit checks on patient customers. Revenue and accounts receivable have been constrained to the extent that billed amounts exceed the amounts estimated to be collected. The constrained transaction price relates primarily to expected billing adjustments with the Payors and patient customers. Management's evaluation of variable consideration takes into account such factors as past experience, information about specific receivables, Payors and patient customers.\nThe assessment of variable consideration to be constrained is based on estimates, and ultimate losses may vary from current estimates. As adjustments to these estimates become necessary, they are reported in earnings in the periods in which they become known. Changes in constraints on variable consideration are recorded as a component of net revenues.\nThe Company generally does not allow returns from providers for reasons not covered under the manufacturer's standard warranty. Therefore, there is no provision for sales return reserves. The Company does not have significant bad debt experience with Payors, and therefore does not maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts.\nFair Value Measurements\nCertain assets and liabilities are carried at fair value under US GAAP. This includes the Company's contingent consideration liability related to the initial durable medical equipment acquisition which is fair valued using unobservable inputs, including volatility, weighted-average cost of capital and related EBITDA forecasts of the acquired businesses. These unobservable inputs are classified as level 3 under the fair value hierarchy within US GAAP.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of fair value over identifiable tangible and intangible net assets acquired in business combinations. Goodwill is not amortized. Instead goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually, or on an interim basis between annual tests when events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. We perform our annual impairment test on the first day of the fiscal fourth quarter. The Company's $50.4 million of goodwill was acquired in conjunction with the acquisitions of the durable medical equipment businesses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 and at the time of recognition the fair value of such goodwill was equal to its carrying value. This goodwill has been recorded within our durable medical equipment reporting unit. Based on our annual impairment test as of April 1, 2019 the fair value of the durable medical equipment reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by 14.5% and no impairment occurred. The fair value of this reporting unit was derived using a combination of present value of estimated cash flows and the valuations and prices of comparable businesses. The discount rate used in this analysis was 14.0%.\nDurable Medical Equipment Revenue\nEquipment Sales and Services Revenues\nThe Company sells durable medical equipment, replacement parts and supplies to customers and recognizes revenue at the point control is transferred through delivery to the customer. Each piece of equipment, part or supply is distinct and separately priced thus they each represent a single performance obligation. The revenue is allocated amongst the performance obligations based upon the relative standalone selling price method, however, items are typically all delivered or supplied together. The customer and, if applicable, the Payors are generally charged at the time that the product is sold, although separate layers of insurance coverage may need to be invoiced before final billings may occur.\nThe Company also provides sleep study services to customers and recognizes revenue when the results of the sleep study are complete as that is when the performance obligation is met.\nThe transaction price on both equipment sales and sleep studies is the amount that the Company expects to receive in exchange for the goods and services provided. Due to the nature of the durable medical equipment business, billing adjustments customarily occur during the collections process when explanations of benefits are received by Payors, and as amounts are deferred to secondary Payors or to patient responsibility. As such, we constrain the transaction price for the difference between the amounts billed and what we believe we will collect from Payors and from patients. The transaction price therefore is predominantly based on contractual payment rates determined by the Payors. The Company does not generally contract with uninsured customers. We determine our estimates of billing adjustments based upon contractual agreements, our policies and historical experience. While the rates are fixed for the product or service with the customer and the Payors, such amounts typically include co-payments, co-insurance and deductibles, which vary in amounts, from the patient customer. The Company includes in the transaction price only the amount that the Company expects to be entitled, which is substantially all of the Payor billings at contractual rates. Due to the fact that we do not typically perform credit checks on patient customers aside from verifying insurance coverage, the transaction price is initially constrained by the amount of customer co-payments we estimate will not be collected.\nDue to the nature of the industry and the reimbursement environment in which the Company operates, certain estimates are required to record net revenue and accounts receivable at their net realizable values. Inherent in these estimates is the risk that they will have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available. Specifically, the complexity of many third-party billing arrangements and the uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for certain services from certain Payors may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded. Such adjustments are typically identified and recorded at the point of cash application or claim denial. There were no material changes in estimates recorded in the year ended June 30, 2019, relating to prior periods.\nThe payment terms and conditions of customer contracts vary by customer type and the products and services offered.\nThe Company may provide shipping services prior to the point of delivery and has concluded that the services represent a fulfilment activity and not a performance obligation. Returns and refunds are not accepted on either equipment sales or sleep study services. The Company does not offer warranties to customers in excess of the manufacturer's warranty. Any taxes due upon sale of the products or services are not recognized as revenue. The Company does not incur contract acquisition costs.\nIncluded in sales and services revenue are unbilled amounts for which the revenue recognition criteria had been met as of period-end but were not yet billed to the Payor. The estimate of net unbilled sales and service revenue recognized is based on historical trends and estimates of future collectability.\nEquipment Rental Revenue\nUnder FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, Leases, (Topic 842) rental income from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis, based on contractual lease terms with fixed and determinable increases over the non-cancellable term of the related lease when collectability is reasonably assured. The Company leases durable medical equipment to customers for a fixed monthly amount on a month-to-month basis. The contractual length of the lease term varies based on the type of equipment that is rented to the customer, but generally is from 10 to 36-months. In the case of capped rental agreements, title to the equipment transfers to the customer at the end of the contractual rental period. The customer has the right to cancel the lease at any time during the rental period for a subsequent month's rental and payments are generally billed in advance on a month-to-month basis. Under Topic 842, rental income from operating leases is recognized on a month-to-month basis, based on contractual lease terms when collectability is reasonably assured. Certain customer co-payments are included in revenue when considered probable of payment, which is generally when paid.\nThe lease term begins on the date products are delivered to patients and are recorded at amounts estimated to be received under reimbursement arrangements with third-party payors, including Medicare, private payors, and Medicaid. Due to the nature of the industry and the reimbursement environment in which the Company operates, certain estimates are required to record net revenue and accounts receivable at their net realizable values. Inherent in these estimates is the risk that they will have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available. Specifically, the complexity of many third-party billing arrangements and the uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for certain services from certain Payors may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded. Such adjustments are typically identified and recorded at the point of cash application or claim denial. There were no material changes in estimates recorded in the year ended June 30, 2019, relating to prior periods.\nAlthough invoicing typically occurs at the beginning of the monthly rental period, we recognize revenue from rentals on a daily basis. Since rental agreements can commence at any time during a given month, we defer revenue related to the remaining monthly rental period as of period end.\nIncluded in rental revenue are unbilled amounts for which the revenue recognition criteria had been met as of period-end but were not yet billed to the Payor. The estimate of net unbilled rental revenue recognized is based on historical trends and estimates of future collectability.\nInvestment Management Revenue\nThe Company recognizes revenue from its investment management business at amounts that reflect the consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for providing services to its customer. Investment management revenue primarily consists of fees based on a percentage of assets under management; fees based on the performance of managed assets; and administrative fees; as follows:\nManagement Fees\nThe Company earns management fees based on the investment management agreement GECM has with GECC. The performance obligation is satisfied over time as the services are rendered, since GECC simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided as GECM performs services. Under GECC's investment management agreement with GECM, the base management fee from GECC is calculated at an annual rate of 1.50% of GECC's average adjusted gross assets. The base management fee is calculated based on the average value of GECC's gross assets, excluding cash and cash equivalents, at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. Management fees are billed quarterly in arrears.\nIncentive Fees\nThe Company earns incentive fees based on the investment management agreements GECM has with GECC and separately managed accounts. Where an investment management agreement includes both management fees and incentive fees, the performance obligation is considered to be a single obligation for both fees. Incentive fees are variable consideration associated with the GECC investment management agreement. Incentive fees are recognized based on investment performance during the period, subject to the achievement of minimum return levels or high-water marks, in accordance with the terms of the respective investment management agreements. Incentive fees range from 5.0% to 20.0%. Because of the uncertainty of when incentive fees will be collected due to market conditions and investment performance, incentive fees are fully constrained and not recorded until received and the probability of significant reversal of the fees is eliminated in accordance with the respective investment management agreements.\nAdministration Fees\nThe Company earns administration fees based on the administration agreement GECM has with GECC whereby GECC reimburses GECM for costs incurred in performing administrative functions for GECC. This revenue is recognized over time as the services are performed. Administrative fees are billed quarterly in arrears, which is consistent with the timing of the delivery of services and reflect agreed upon rates for the services provided. The services are accounted for as a single performance obligation that is a series of distinct services with substantially the same pattern of transfer as the services are provided on a daily basis.\nReal Estate Revenue\nRental Revenue\nConsistent with the leases of durable medical equipment, the Company recognizes rental revenue on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable term of the lease. Under the terms of the lease, the Company may recover from the tenant certain expenses, including: insurance and other operating expenses. For all expenses that are paid by the Company and reimbursed by the tenant, the recovery of these expenses is recognized in rental income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, in the same periods as the expenses are incurred. These expenses recognized in both revenue and expense may fluctuate from period to period based on actual expense amounts.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when necessary in order to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be recovered.\nThe Company has established a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets that are not recoverable from taxable temporary differences because the Company is unable to conclude that future utilization of a portion of its NOL carryforwards and other deferred tax assets is more likely than not.\nThe calculation of the Company's tax positions involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in several different state tax jurisdictions. The Company is periodically reviewed by tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These reviews include inquiries regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. The Company records estimated reserves for exposures associated with positions that it takes on its income tax returns that do not meet the more likely than not standards.\nBusiness Combinations\nBusiness combinations are accounted for at fair value. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses; previously held equity interests are valued at fair value upon the acquisition of a controlling interest; restructuring costs associated with a business combination are expensed subsequent to the acquisition date; and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date affect income tax expense. Measurement period adjustments are made in the period in which the amounts are determined and the current period income effect of such adjustments will be calculated as if the adjustments had been completed as of the acquisition date. All changes that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are also included in current period earnings. The accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business, and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, in determining the estimated fair value for assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration, are based on management's estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates, the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill, require acceleration of the amortization expense of finite-lived intangible assets, or the recognition of additional consideration which would be expensed. The fair value of contingent consideration is remeasured each period based on relevant information and changes to the fair value are included in the operating results for the period.\nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion is reflective of our four business operating segments: durable medical equipment, investment management, real estate and general corporate. Real estate and durable medical equipment commenced operations in March and September 2018, respectively. Correspondingly, the results of operations for the period ended June 30, 2019 for each of these segments is not comparable to the corresponding periods ended June 30, 2018.\nThe following table

durable medical equipment business, $3.8 million from the investment management business and $5.5 million from the real estate business, while revenues for the year ended June 30, 2018 included $4.1 million from the investment management business and $1.9 million from the real estate business. Revenues from the year ended June 30, 2017 included $4.9 million from the investment management business. The increase in total revenue for the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the years ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017 are primarily attributable to the acquisition of the real estate business in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 and the acquisition of the durable medical equipment business in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.\nOperating costs and expenses\nThe increase in operating costs for the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to the additional costs associated with the durable medical equipment business, including cost of goods sold and cost of rentals, as well as the general and administrative costs of the durable medical equipment business, depreciation on fixed assets and amortization of the intangible assets associated with the durable medical equipment business. The increase in operating costs for the year ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2017 is primarily attributable to increased compensation costs in connection with the investment management business. In addition, for the year ended June 30, 2017, the general corporate business received a one-time reimbursement associated with the formation of GECC of approximately $3.0 million resulting in lower expenses for that year.\nOther income (expense)\nInterest expense increased for the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2018 due to increased borrowings related to our acquisitions in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 and in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. Interest expense decreased for the year ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2017 due to additional costs incurred in retiring senior notes during the 2017 fiscal year. Other income and expense primarily consisted of dividend income and unrealized gains or losses on the Company's investment in GECC and interest income earned on cash balances.\nDurable Medical Equipment\nThe key metrics of our durable medical equipment business include:\n \u25aa Patients and setup growth - which drives revenue growth and takes advantage of scalable operations \n \u25aa Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) \nThe following table provides the results of our durable medical equipment business for the period from its inception in September 2018 to June 30, 2019 (the DME inception period).

For the DME inception period, cost of rentals included $5.6 million of depreciation on medical equipment held for lease with the remaining costs related to maintenance expenses.\nOther selling, general and administrative expenses for the DME inception period included approximately $14.4 million of payroll and related costs, $1.5 million of rental expenses associated with facility and equipment leases, and other administrative costs. In addition, the Company incurred transaction costs of $0.6 million for the DME inception period in connection with the acquisition of the durable medical equipment businesses. Depreciation and amortization includes the depreciation of fixed assets, excluding depreciation on the equipment held for rental, which is included in the cost of rentals, and amortization of the intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of the durable medical equipment businesses.\nIn addition to the operating costs and expenses, we recognized interest expense of $3.4 million for the DME inception period. Other income (expense) for the DME inception period ended June 30, 2019 includes dividend income of $0.7 million and realized loss of $0.9 million for the portion of the investment in GECC which had been restricted in connection with the Great Elm DME Holdings, Inc. (DME Holdings) preferred shares issued at inception of the durable medical equipment business in September 2018 (see Note 13 - Non-Controlling Interests and Preferred Stock of Subsidiary in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In addition, management and monitoring expenses, which are payable to Great Elm DME Manager, LLC (DME Manager), a subsidiary of the Company in the general corporate segment, and one of the former owners of the durable medical equipment businesses, are included in other expense.\nInvestment Management\nThe key metrics of our investment management business include:\n \u25aa Assets under management - which provides the basis on which our management fees and performance milestones for vesting of certain equity awards are based \n \u25aa Investment performance - on which our incentive fees (if any) are based and on which we are measured against our competition \nThe following table provides the results of our investment management business for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018:\nTable 122: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the years ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,841\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating costs and expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (521\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (85\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,487\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consulting agreement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (763\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (688\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,741\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (32\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,031\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (631\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (585\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,656\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,791\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (815\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,706\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (180\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (17\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (217\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (180\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (204\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total pre-tax income (loss) from continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (995\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (4,910\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Investment management revenues are net of incentive fee reversals determined based upon a hypothetical liquidation of net assets at period end. The incentive fee reversals are primarily related to the conversion of Avanti Communications Group plc (Avanti) third lien notes, an investment owned by GECC, to common equity. \nInvestment Management Revenue\nInvestment management revenues include management fees and administration fees related to the management of GECC. For the year ended June 30, 2018, investment management revenues also included incentive fees from the management of GECC. As a result of the adoption of Topic 606 on July 1, 2018, incentive fees were not recognized for the year ended June 30, 2019. See Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFor the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, we recognized $3.0 million and $2.6 million, respectively, of management fee revenue and $0.9 million and $1.3 million, respectively, of administration fee revenue. The increase in management fee revenue for the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to an increase in the average assets on which such fees are calculated. Administration fees for the year ended June 30, 2018 included one-time costs associated with organizational restructuring and staffing changes at the Company which increased the costs on which the administration fees are based.\nInvestment Management Costs and Expenses\nOther general and administrative costs consist primarily of payroll and related costs, excluding stock-based compensation, professional fees, facilities and other overhead costs. For the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, facilities costs were $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively. The year over year decrease is primarily attributable to the Company moving to lower cost office space in October of 2017, as well as growth of the general corporate business resulting in lower allocation of shared expenses for the investment management business. Other overhead costs have remained consistent at approximately $0.3 million for each year.\nProfessional fees were less than $0.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2019; however, for the year ended June 30, 2018, professional fees were $0.2 million as a result of non-recurring costs incurred in connection with the September 2017 separation from MAST Capital (MAST Separation).\nFor the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, payroll and related costs, excluding stock-based compensation, were approximately $2.3 million and $3.2 million, respectively. The decrease in payroll and related costs for the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to the growth of the Company resulting in approximately $0.8 million in allocations of certain management personnel costs to the other business segments.\nThe decrease in stock-based compensation for the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to certain non-recurring costs recognized in connection with the MAST Separation. These non-recurring costs include:\n \u25aa the elimination of the vesting provisions and call rights for the GECC GP Corp. stock owned by certain employees of the Company resulting in stock-based compensation expense equal to the estimated fair value of the non-controlling interest in GECC GP Corp. held by those employees of $1.5 million; and \n \u25aa the restructuring of compensation arrangements for remaining employees resulting in higher stock-based compensation awarded in lieu of reductions in salaries for those employees. For the year ended June 30, 2019 these increases were partially offset by reversals of previously accrued stock-based compensation due to updated estimates related to the vesting criteria for certain performance-based awards. \nGECM has a consulting agreement with a third party to provide services in exchange for 26% of the fees earned from the management of GECC, excluding incentive fees. The increase in the costs associated with this consulting agreement for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 are consistent with the corresponding increases in management fee revenue for the same periods.\nReal Estate\nThe key metrics of our real estate business include rental revenues, depreciation on rental properties and interest expense on the related debt.\nThe following table provides the results of our real estate business for the year ended June 30, 2019 and the period from its inception in March 2018 to June 30, 2018 (the RE inception period):\nTable 126: <table> <tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the year ended June 30, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the period March 6, 2018 to June 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating costs and expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (884\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (375\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,729\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (538\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,613\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (913\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,846\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,655\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (854\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,655\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (854\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total pre-tax income (loss) from continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nReal Estate Revenue\nFor the year ended June 30, 2019 and the RE inception period, we recognized $5.5 million and $1.9 million of rental revenue in connection with our recently acquired Class A office buildings in Fort Myers, Florida. The increase in revenue is due to having a full year of operations for the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to approximately four months for the RE inception period.\nReal Estate Costs and Expenses\nOur real estate business' costs primarily consist of management fees, insurance and state sales tax, depreciation of real estate assets and the amortization of the in-place lease intangible assets. For the year ended June 30, 2019 and the RE inception period depreciation was $1.2 million and $0.4 million, respectively, and amortization was $0.5 million and $0.2 million, respectively. In addition, we incurred $2.7 million and $0.9 million, respectively, of interest expense in connection with the Senior Note and Subordinated Note (each as defined herein) for the year ended June 30, 2019 and the RE inception period. Increases in the current year as compared to the prior period are due to having a full year of operations.\nGeneral Corporate\nThe following table provides the results of our general corporate business for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018:\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the years ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating costs and expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (457\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (51\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (938\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transaction costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,582\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,136\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,904\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,625\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,943\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,700\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,820\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,700\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1276\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (143\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (143\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total pre-tax income (loss) from continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (7,138\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (6,843\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral Corporate Revenue\nFor the year ended June 30, 2019, all revenue was derived from fees earned by DME Manager, which provides consulting services to DME Inc. Both DME Manager and DME Inc. were formed in connection with the acquisition of the durable medical equipment businesses in September 2018 and there was no corresponding activity prior to this acquisition.\nGeneral Corporate Costs and Expenses\nOur general and administrative costs primarily consisted of professional fees, payroll and facility costs for our finance, legal and other administrative functions as well as professional fees and payroll costs in connection with our diligence efforts towards identifying asset and business acquisition opportunities. For the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, professional fees in relation to the diligence of such opportunities were $1.6 million and $1.1 million, respectively. The increase in such professional fees for the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2018 was primarily driven by the significant acquisition of our durable medical equipment business in September 2018.\nThe increase in other general and administrative costs for the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the prior year was primarily driven by an increase of approximately $1.0 million in professional fees for external audit and other accounting advisory services and approximately $0.6 million in additional payroll and related costs, excluding stock-based compensation. The increases in payroll and related costs were partially offset by the $0.5 million reduction in stock-based compensation for the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2018.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther income and expense primarily consisted of dividend income and unrealized gains or losses on the Company's investment in GECC and interest income earned on cash balances. Dividend income for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 was $1.7 million and $2.4 million, respectively. During the year ended June 30, 2019, a portion of the Company's investment in GECC had been allocated to the durable medical equipment segment due to collateral requirements of the related party qualified preferred shares issued by DME Holdings in connection with the acquisition of the durable medical equipment businesses. This resulted in a decrease of $0.6 million in dividend income for the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the dividend income for the year ended June 30, 2018.\nWe recognized unrealized losses of $0.2 million and $2.7 million, respectively, for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. We mark-to-market our investment in GECC by reference to the closing price of GECC common stock on Nasdaq as of each period end.\nIncome Taxes\nAlthough in the aggregate we expect to owe no federal taxes for the year ended June 30, 2019, we are required to provide intra period taxes allocated between continuing operations and discontinued operations. During 2019, the Company recognized an income tax benefit with respect to discontinued operations of $1.3 million related to intraperiod allocations. In addition, the Company recognized an income tax benefit with respect to deferred tax liabilities of $0.9 million acquired in the durable medical equipment acquisition. State and local taxes were approximately $0.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2019.\nSummary of Discontinued Operations\nOn June 30, 2016, the Company sold two of its previously wholly-owned subsidiaries (the Divestiture) engaged in the patent licensing business for an aggregate purchase price of up to $40 million. The purchaser paid the Company $30 million, plus certain adjustments, upon the closing of the Divestiture, and had made claims that it had incurred indemnifiable losses in excess of the remaining $10 million due under the purchase and sale agreement.\nOn January 21, 2019, we entered into a mutual release and settlement agreement with the purchaser resulting in the release of any indemnifiable liabilities and an incremental cash receipt of $1.5 million. Prior to the execution of this settlement, the Company had determined that a loss related to final settlement with the purchaser was not realizable or estimable, and therefore had not accrued for any losses; however, the recognition of a portion of proceeds received associated with the former patent licensing business had been deferred pending finalization of all contingencies. The settlement resulted in a $5.0 million gain in discontinued operations during the year ended June 30, 2019, consisting of the extinguishment of related liabilities of $3.6 million and the receipt of cash of $1.5 million from the purchaser, partially offset by legal fees of $0.1 million. The net income from discontinued operations includes these gains, offset by a tax provision of $1.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2019.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the Company's discontinued operations for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018:\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the years ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Discontinued operations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Extinguishment of liabilities related to discontinued operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative expenses(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (87\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (165\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pretax gain (loss) from discontinued operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (165\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax benefit (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,285\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net gain (loss) from discontinued operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,736\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (165\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) During the year ended June 30, 2018, we incurred discontinued operating costs of $0.2 million related to the representations and warranties associated with the disposal of our legacy patent licensing business. \nNet Revenues\nAs a result of the settlement during the year ended June 30, 2019, we recognized $1.5 million in net revenues for the period. There were no revenues related to discontinued operations for the year ended June 30, 2018.\nExtinguishment of Liabilities\nAs a result of the settlement during the year ended June 30, 2019, $3.6 million of liabilities related to the discontinued operations were extinguished.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nDuring the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, the general and administrative expenses of our discontinued operations related primarily to the work associated with settling claims on the representations and warranties in connection with the Divestiture.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table presents selected financial information and statistics as of June 30, 2019 and 2018:\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Current Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 42,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 63,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Current Liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,510\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Working Capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 55,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long Term Liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 95,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 60,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the years ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,691\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,845\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (54,903\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,368\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (30,710\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,354\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWorking Capital and Cash Flows\nAs of June 30, 2019, we had a cash balance of $12.1 million. We also own 1,966,667 shares of GECC common stock with an estimated fair value of $17.1 million as of June 30, 2019.\nWe intend to make acquisitions that will likely result in our investment of all of our liquid financial resources, the issuance of equity securities and the incurrence of indebtedness. If we are unsuccessful at raising additional capital resources, through either debt or equity, it is unlikely we will be able execute our strategic growth plan. See Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nCash Provided by or Used in Operating Activities. Cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $2.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. Cash flows used in operating activities totaled $3.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2018.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2019, net cash provided by operating activities for continuing operations consisted primarily of the net loss of $3.1 million and gain on discontinued operations of $3.7 million offset by non-cash activity, including $9.2 million of depreciation and amortization. Changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in net cash used in operating activities of $3.0 million, primarily consisting of an increase in accounts receivable of $2.8 million and decrease in operating leases of $1.1 million offset by increases in related party payables of $0.8 million. These changes in operating assets and liabilities are primarily related to operational changes as a result of the acquisition of our durable medical equipment businesses during the year.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2018, net cash used in operating activities consisted primarily of the following revenues and expenses: $4.1 million of investment management revenue received; $1.9 million of real estate revenue received; $4.3 million of cash based compensation and benefits paid to our employees; $1.4 million of costs incurred in the investigation and diligence of acquisition opportunities; $1.7 million of professional fees incurred; $0.4 million of real estate administrative expenses; $0.7 million of consulting fees and $0.8 million of rental and insurance expenses.\nCash Used in Investing Activities. Cash flows used in investing activities totaled $54.9 million and $2.4 million for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. For the year ended June 30, 2019 investing activities primarily consist of $48.1 million spent in the acquisitions of our durable medical equipment businesses in September 2018 and June 2019, as well as the purchase of $6.8 million in equipment held for rental and another $0.8 million in fixed assets related to the durable medical equipment business.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2018, investing activities primarily relate to the acquisition of our initial real estate assets.\nCash Provided by Financing Activities. Cash flows provided by financing activities totaled $21.5 million and $3.9 million for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. For the year ended June 30, 2019, cash inflows of approximately $19.9 million and $6.6 million were provided by net proceeds on the note payable from a seller and a revolving line of credit, respectively, established with the acquisition of the durable medical equipment business, including additional draws made during the year. Additionally, $1.6 million was provided by proceeds from equipment financing arrangements and $1.4 million was provided by the exercise of warrants in July 2018. These inflows were partially offset by principal payments of $2.8 million on our long term debt and related party notes payable, as well as $5.1 million paid to redeem the preferred stock of a subsidiary during the year ended June 30, 2019.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2018, financing activities primarily related to the exercise of warrants resulting in cash proceeds of $4.6 million and the issuance of 1,266,000 shares of our common stock. This cash inflow was partially offset by payments made on the Senior Note payable related to our real estate business of $0.6 million.\nBorrowings\nAs of June 30, 2019, we had a note due to a non-controlling interest holder of DME Inc., Corbel Capital Partners SBIC, L.P., totaling $27.6 million that accrues interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 10.0% (at June 30, 2019, the effective interest rate was 12.32%) through maturity on August 31, 2023 (the Corbel Facility). The Corbel Facility requires quarterly interest payments along with principal payments of $0.3 million plus an additional amount based on excess cash flows, if any, generated by the durable medical equipment business operations. The Corbel Facility is secured by all of the assets of the durable medical equipment business and the Company is required to meet certain financial covenants.\nThe Company has the option to prepay the borrowings outstanding under the Corbel Facility in whole or in part subject to certain prepayment penalties ranging from 1.0% - 5.0% of the early payment of the principal, based on the time that the Corbel Facility has been outstanding through the first five years of the loan.\nDME Inc. is required to pay to Corbel, as agent of the Corbel Facility, a quarterly monitoring fee of $25,000 per quarter while the borrowings remain outstanding. In addition, if the borrowing is repaid with proceeds of debt in full or in part at any time within the first three years from the date of issuance, the borrower shall pay an additional fee to the agent, ranging from 2.10% to 3.50% depending on the date of repayment based on the period outstanding, of the aggregate repaid principal amount.\nAs of June 30, 2019, we had a credit facility due to Pacific Mercantile Bank totaling $7.4 million that accrues interest at the prime rate plus 0.40% (at June 30, 2019, the effective rate was 5.90%) through maturity on August 30, 2020 (the DME Revolver). The DME Revolver allows for borrowings up to $10 million. The DME Revolver requires monthly interest payments. The DME Revolver is secured by all of the assets of the durable medical equipment business and the Company is required to meet certain financial covenants.\nThe Corbel Facility and DME Revolver each include covenants that restrict DME Inc. business operations to its current business, limit additional indebtedness, liens, asset dispositions and investments, require compliance and maintenance of licenses and government approvals and other customary conditions. Events of default include the failure to pay amounts when due, bankruptcy, or violation of covenants, including a change in control of DME Inc. DME Inc. must also comply with a fixed-charge coverage and leverage ratio financial covenants, which are based in part on the DME Inc. EBITDA levels.\nAs of June 30, 2019, we had a related party note due to MAST Capital (the GP Corp. Note) totaling $3.1 million that accrues interest at a variable rate of three-month LIBOR plus 3.0%, as adjusted for each 90-day period (at June 30, 2019, the effective rate was 5.32%) through maturity on November 3, 2026. The GP Corp. Note requires minimum annual principal payments of $0.08 million and quarterly interest-only payments. The GP Corp. Note is secured by the profit sharing agreement between GECM and GECC GP Corp. (the Profit Sharing Agreement) that transfers profits generated by our management of GECC, with no recourse to any of our other assets, entities or operations.\nThe GP Corp. Note is non-recourse to any of the Company's operations or net assets not related to GECM's management services to GECC. The GP Corp. Note may be prepaid at par value at any time with prior written notice to the holders of the GP Corp. Note. Additionally, GECC GP Corp. is required to prepay the GP Corp. Note upon certain material liquidation transactions including any termination of the Profit Sharing Agreement.\nAs of June 30, 2019, we had a senior note due to Wells Fargo Bank Northwest, National totaling $52.2 million that accrues interest at a rate of 3.49% through maturity on March 15, 2030 (the Senior Note). The Senior Note requires monthly principal and interest payments through the maturity date. The Senior Note is secured by a first lien mortgage on the Property and an Assignment of Leases and Rents, with no recourse to any of our assets, entities or operations.\nThe principal and interest due on the Senior Note may be prepaid at the option of the borrower, based on an amount determined by discounting the remaining principal and interest payments at a rate equal to an applicable premium in excess of a rate corresponding to the specified U.S. Treasury security over the remaining average life of the Senior Note.\nAs of June 30, 2019, we had a subordinated note due to Wells Fargo Bank Northwest, National totaling $3.3 million that accrues interest at a rate of 15.00% through maturity on March 15, 2030 (the Subordinated Note). The Subordinated Note is a capital appreciation note, whereby the monthly interest is capitalized to the principal balance and due at maturity. The Subordinated Note is secured by a second lien mortgage on the Property, and an Assignment of Leases and Rents, with no recourse to any of our assets, entities or operations.\nThe principal and interest due on the Subordinated Note may be prepaid at the option of the borrower, based on an amount determined by discounting the remaining principal and interest payments at a rate equal to an applicable premium in excess of a rate corresponding to the specified U.S. Treasury security over the remaining average life of the Subordinated Note.\nThe note agreements for both the Senior Note and the Subordinated Note include negative covenants that restrict the Company's majority-owned subsidiary, CRIC IT Fort Myers LLC's (the Property Owner) business operations to ownership and lease of the Property, limit additional indebtedness, require maintenance of insurance and other customary requirements related to the Property. Events of default include non-payment of amounts when due, inability to pay indebtedness or material change in the business operations or financial condition of the Property Owner or the lease tenant that in the lender's reasonable determination would reasonably be expected to materially impair the value of the Property, prevent timely repayment of the notes or performance of any material obligations under the note and related agreements. The payments under the notes are also guaranteed on a full and several basis by the non-controlling interest holder of the Property Owner. Both the Senior Note and Subordinated Note are non-recourse to the Company, but are secured by the Property, the rights associated with the leases and the stock owned by the Company in the Property Owner.\nBeginning in April 2019, DME Inc's operating subsidiaries also utilize equipment financing debt to fund certain inventory and equipment purchases from suppliers. These equipment financing debt agreements are entered into with 3rd party banks and are generally payable in equal installments over terms of one to three years, depending on the nature of the underlying purchases being financed. The debt is secured by the inventory and equipment, as applicable, of the operating subsidiaries entering into the agreements, and the long-term agreements have implicit interest rates between 7 - 8%. During the year ended June 30, 2019, the Company financed $1.6 million in inventory and equipment through such financing agreements.\nContractual Obligations\nOur contractual obligations as of June 30, 2019 are presented in the table below:\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments due by period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corbel Facility(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 40,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,618\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,889\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> DME Revolver(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,919\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> GP Corp.

Note agreement, GECC GP Corp. agreed not to declare any dividends until the GP Corp. Note is satisfied. In the Senior Note and Subordinated Note, the Property Owner is restricted from paying any dividends until such notes are satisfied. The ability of DME Inc. to pay dividends is subject to compliance with the restricted payment covenants under the Corbel Facility and DME Revolver.\nOff-Balance Sheet Obligations\nAs of June 30, 2019, we did not invest in any off-balance sheet vehicles that provide financing, liquidity, market or credit risk support or engage in any leasing activities that expose us to any liability that is not reflected in our consolidated financial statements.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified entirely by, our consolidated financial statements (including Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and the other consolidated financial information appearing elsewhere in this report. Some of the information in this discussion and analysis includes forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. Actual results and timing of events could differ from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nThe following discussion and analysis omits discussion of fiscal year 2017. Please see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 for a discussion of fiscal year 2017.\nOverview\nWe are a holding company seeking to acquire assets and businesses, where our people and other assets provide a competitive advantage. We currently have four business operating segments: durable medical equipment, investment management, real estate, and general corporate.\nFor additional information see Item 1. Business.\u201d\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. These items are monitored and analyzed by our management for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future.\nAccounts Receivable\nSubstantially all of the accounts receivable balance relates to the durable medical equipment business. Accounts receivable are customer obligations due under normal sales and rental terms and represent the amount estimated to be collected from the patient customers and, if applicable, the third-party private insurance provider or government program (collectively, Payors), based on the contractual agreements. The Company does not require collateral in connection with its customer transactions and aside from verifying insurance coverage, does not perform credit checks on patient customers. Revenue and accounts receivable have been constrained to the extent that billed amounts exceed the amounts estimated to be collected. The constrained transaction price relates primarily to expected billing adjustments with the Payors and patient customers. Management's evaluation of variable consideration takes into account such factors as past experience, information about specific receivables, Payors and patient customers.\nThe assessment of variable consideration to be constrained is based on estimates, and ultimate losses may vary from current estimates. As adjustments to these estimates become necessary, they are reported in earnings in the periods in which they become known. Changes in constraints on variable consideration are recorded as a component of net revenues.\nThe Company generally does not allow returns from providers for reasons not covered under the manufacturer's standard warranty. Therefore, there is no provision for sales return reserves. The Company does not have significant bad debt experience with Payors, and therefore does not maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts.\nFair Value Measurements\nCertain assets and liabilities are carried at fair value under US GAAP. This includes the Company's contingent consideration liability related to the initial durable medical equipment acquisition which is fair valued using unobservable inputs, including volatility, weighted-average cost of capital and related EBITDA forecasts of the acquired businesses. These unobservable inputs are classified as level 3 under the fair value hierarchy within US GAAP.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of fair value over identifiable tangible and intangible net assets acquired in business combinations. Goodwill is not amortized. Instead goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually, or on an interim basis between annual tests when events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. We perform our annual impairment test on the first day of the fiscal fourth quarter. The Company's $50.4 million of goodwill was acquired in conjunction with the acquisitions of the durable medical equipment businesses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 and at the time of recognition the fair value of such goodwill was equal to its carrying value. This goodwill has been recorded within our durable medical equipment reporting unit. Based on our annual impairment test as of April 1, 2019 the fair value of the durable medical equipment reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by 14.5% and no impairment occurred. The fair value of this reporting unit was derived using a combination of present value of estimated cash flows and the valuations and prices of comparable businesses. The discount rate used in this analysis was 14.0%.\nDurable Medical Equipment Revenue\nEquipment Sales and Services Revenues\nThe Company sells durable medical equipment, replacement parts and supplies to customers and recognizes revenue at the point control is transferred through delivery to the customer. Each piece of equipment, part or supply is distinct and separately priced thus they each represent a single performance obligation. The revenue is allocated amongst the performance obligations based upon the relative standalone selling price method, however, items are typically all delivered or supplied together. The customer and, if applicable, the Payors are generally charged at the time that the product is sold, although separate layers of insurance coverage may need to be invoiced before final billings may occur.\nThe Company also provides sleep study services to customers and recognizes revenue when the results of the sleep study are complete as that is when the performance obligation is met.\nThe transaction price on both equipment sales and sleep studies is the amount that the Company expects to receive in exchange for the goods and services provided. Due to the nature of the durable medical equipment business, billing adjustments customarily occur during the collections process when explanations of benefits are received by Payors, and as amounts are deferred to secondary Payors or to patient responsibility. As such, we constrain the transaction price for the difference between the amounts billed and what we believe we will collect from Payors and from patients. The transaction price therefore is predominantly based on contractual payment rates determined by the Payors. The Company does not generally contract with uninsured customers. We determine our estimates of billing adjustments based upon contractual agreements, our policies and historical experience. While the rates are fixed for the product or service with the customer and the Payors, such amounts typically include co-payments, co-insurance and deductibles, which vary in amounts, from the patient customer. The Company includes in the transaction price only the amount that the Company expects to be entitled, which is substantially all of the Payor billings at contractual rates. Due to the fact that we do not typically perform credit checks on patient customers aside from verifying insurance coverage, the transaction price is initially constrained by the amount of customer co-payments we estimate will not be collected.\nDue to the nature of the industry and the reimbursement environment in which the Company operates, certain estimates are required to record net revenue and accounts receivable at their net realizable values. Inherent in these estimates is the risk that they will have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available. Specifically, the complexity of many third-party billing arrangements and the uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for certain services from certain Payors may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded. Such adjustments are typically identified and recorded at the point of cash application or claim denial. There were no material changes in estimates recorded in the year ended June 30, 2019, relating to prior periods.\nThe payment terms and conditions of customer contracts vary by customer type and the products and services offered.\nThe Company may provide shipping services prior to the point of delivery and has concluded that the services represent a fulfilment activity and not a performance obligation. Returns and refunds are not accepted on either equipment sales or sleep study services. The Company does not offer warranties to customers in excess of the manufacturer's warranty. Any taxes due upon sale of the products or services are not recognized as revenue. The Company does not incur contract acquisition costs.\nIncluded in sales and services revenue are unbilled amounts for which the revenue recognition criteria had been met as of period-end but were not yet billed to the Payor. The estimate of net unbilled sales and service revenue recognized is based on historical trends and estimates of future collectability.\nEquipment Rental Revenue\nUnder FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, Leases, (Topic 842) rental income from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis, based on contractual lease terms with fixed and determinable increases over the non-cancellable term of the related lease when collectability is reasonably assured. The Company leases durable medical equipment to customers for a fixed monthly amount on a month-to-month basis. The contractual length of the lease term varies based on the type of equipment that is rented to the customer, but generally is from 10 to 36-months. In the case of capped rental agreements, title to the equipment transfers to the customer at the end of the contractual rental period. The customer has the right to cancel the lease at any time during the rental period for a subsequent month's rental and payments are generally billed in advance on a month-to-month basis. Under Topic 842, rental income from operating leases is recognized on a month-to-month basis, based on contractual lease terms when collectability is reasonably assured. Certain customer co-payments are included in revenue when considered probable of payment, which is generally when paid.\nThe lease term begins on the date products are delivered to patients and are recorded at amounts estimated to be received under reimbursement arrangements with third-party payors, including Medicare, private payors, and Medicaid. Due to the nature of the industry and the reimbursement environment in which the Company operates, certain estimates are required to record net revenue and accounts receivable at their net realizable values. Inherent in these estimates is the risk that they will have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available. Specifically, the complexity of many third-party billing arrangements and the uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for certain services from certain Payors may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded. Such adjustments are typically identified and recorded at the point of cash application or claim denial. There were no material changes in estimates recorded in the year ended June 30, 2019, relating to prior periods.\nAlthough invoicing typically occurs at the beginning of the monthly rental period, we recognize revenue from rentals on a daily basis. Since rental agreements can commence at any time during a given month, we defer revenue related to the remaining monthly rental period as of period end.\nIncluded in rental revenue are unbilled amounts for which the revenue recognition criteria had been met as of period-end but were not yet billed to the Payor. The estimate of net unbilled rental revenue recognized is based on historical trends and estimates of future collectability.\nInvestment Management Revenue\nThe Company recognizes revenue from its investment management business at amounts that reflect the consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for providing services to its customer. Investment management revenue primarily consists of fees based on a percentage of assets under management; fees based on the performance of managed assets; and administrative fees; as follows:\nManagement Fees\nThe Company earns management fees based on the investment management agreement GECM has with GECC. The performance obligation is satisfied over time as the services are rendered, since GECC simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided as GECM performs services. Under GECC's investment management agreement with GECM, the base management fee from GECC is calculated at an annual rate of 1.50% of GECC's average adjusted gross assets. The base management fee is calculated based on the average value of GECC's gross assets, excluding cash and cash equivalents, at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. Management fees are billed quarterly in arrears.\nIncentive Fees\nThe Company earns incentive fees based on the investment management agreements GECM has with GECC and separately managed accounts. Where an investment management agreement includes both management fees and incentive fees, the performance obligation is considered to be a single obligation for both fees. Incentive fees are variable consideration associated with the GECC investment management agreement. Incentive fees are recognized based on investment performance during the period, subject to the achievement of minimum return levels or high-water marks, in accordance with the terms of the respective investment management agreements. Incentive fees range from 5.0% to 20.0%. Because of the uncertainty of when incentive fees will be collected due to market conditions and investment performance, incentive fees are fully constrained and not recorded until received and the probability of significant reversal of the fees is eliminated in accordance with the respective investment management agreements.\nAdministration Fees\nThe Company earns administration fees based on the administration agreement GECM has with GECC whereby GECC reimburses GECM for costs incurred in performing administrative functions for GECC. This revenue is recognized over time as the services are performed. Administrative fees are billed quarterly in arrears, which is consistent with the timing of the delivery of services and reflect agreed upon rates for the services provided. The services are accounted for as a single performance obligation that is a series of distinct services with substantially the same pattern of transfer as the services are provided on a daily basis.\nReal Estate Revenue\nRental Revenue\nConsistent with the leases of durable medical equipment, the Company recognizes rental revenue on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable term of the lease. Under the terms of the lease, the Company may recover from the tenant certain expenses, including: insurance and other operating expenses. For all expenses that are paid by the Company and reimbursed by the tenant, the recovery of these expenses is recognized in rental income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, in the same periods as the expenses are incurred. These expenses recognized in both revenue and expense may fluctuate from period to period based on actual expense amounts.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when necessary in order to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be recovered.\nThe Company has established a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets that are not recoverable from taxable temporary differences because the Company is unable to conclude that future utilization of a portion of its NOL carryforwards and other deferred tax assets is more likely than not.\nThe calculation of the Company's tax positions involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in several different state tax jurisdictions. The Company is periodically reviewed by tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These reviews include inquiries regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. The Company records estimated reserves for exposures associated with positions that it takes on its income tax returns that do not meet the more likely than not standards.\nBusiness Combinations\nBusiness combinations are accounted for at fair value. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses; previously held equity interests are valued at fair value upon the acquisition of a controlling interest; restructuring costs associated with a business combination are expensed subsequent to the acquisition date; and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date affect income tax expense. Measurement period adjustments are made in the period in which the amounts are determined and the current period income effect of such adjustments will be calculated as if the adjustments had been completed as of the acquisition date. All changes that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are also included in current period earnings. The accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business, and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, in determining the estimated fair value for assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration, are based on management's estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates, the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill, require acceleration of the amortization expense of finite-lived intangible assets, or the recognition of additional consideration which would be expensed. The fair value of contingent consideration is remeasured each period based on relevant information and changes to the fair value are included in the operating results for the period.\nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion is reflective of our four business operating segments: durable medical equipment, investment management, real estate and general corporate. Real estate and durable medical equipment commenced operations in March and September 2018, respectively. Correspondingly, the results of operations for the period ended June 30, 2019 for each of these segments is not comparable to the corresponding periods ended June 30, 2018.\nThe following table provides the results of our consolidated operations for the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017:\n\nRevenues\nRevenues for the year ended June 30, 2019 included $41.9 million from the durable medical equipment business, $3.8 million from the investment management business and $5.5 million from the real estate business, while revenues for the year ended June 30, 2018 included $4.1 million from the investment management business and $1.9 million from the real estate business. Revenues from the year ended June 30, 2017 included $4.9 million from the investment management business. The increase in total revenue for the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the years ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017 are primarily attributable to the acquisition of the real estate business in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 and the acquisition of the durable medical equipment business in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.\nOperating costs and expenses\nThe increase in operating costs for the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to the additional costs associated with the durable medical equipment business, including cost of goods sold and cost of rentals, as well as the general and administrative costs of the durable medical equipment business, depreciation on fixed assets and amortization of the intangible assets associated with the durable medical equipment business. The increase in operating costs for the year ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2017 is primarily attributable to increased compensation costs in connection with the investment management business. In addition, for the year ended June 30, 2017, the general corporate business received a one-time reimbursement associated with the formation of GECC of approximately $3.0 million resulting in lower expenses for that year.\nOther income (expense)\nInterest expense increased for the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2018 due to increased borrowings related to our acquisitions in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 and in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. Interest expense decreased for the year ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2017 due to additional costs incurred in retiring senior notes during the 2017 fiscal year. Other income and expense primarily consisted of dividend income and unrealized gains or losses on the Company's investment in GECC and interest income earned on cash balances.\nDurable Medical Equipment\nThe key metrics of our durable medical equipment business include:\n \u25aa Patients and setup growth - which drives revenue growth and takes advantage of scalable operations \n \u25aa Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) \nThe following table provides the results of our durable medical equipment business for the period from its inception in September 2018 to June 30, 2019 (the DME inception period). We began to operate the durable medical equipment business in September 2018 and thus there are no comparable results prior to that date.\n\nDurable Medical Equipment Revenue\nFor the DME inception period, durable medical equipment revenue consisted of $27.3 million in sales of medical equipment and sleep study services and $14.6 million in rentals of medical equipment.\nDurable Medical Equipment Costs and Expenses\nCost of goods sold includes inventory costs for medical equipment sold and direct costs associated with running sleep study services, including staff compensation to perform the studies and the purchase of supplies used in the studies. For the DME inception period, cost of rentals included $5.6 million of depreciation on medical equipment held for lease with the remaining costs related to maintenance expenses.\nOther selling, general and administrative expenses for the DME inception period included approximately $14.4 million of payroll and related costs, $1.5 million of rental expenses associated with facility and equipment leases, and other administrative costs. In addition, the Company incurred transaction costs of $0.6 million for the DME inception period in connection with the acquisition of the durable medical equipment businesses. Depreciation and amortization includes the depreciation of fixed assets, excluding depreciation on the equipment held for rental, which is included in the cost of rentals, and amortization of the intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of the durable medical equipment businesses.\nIn addition to the operating costs and expenses, we recognized interest expense of $3.4 million for the DME inception period. Other income (expense) for the DME inception period ended June 30, 2019 includes dividend income of $0.7 million and realized loss of $0.9 million for the portion of the investment in GECC which had been restricted in connection with the Great Elm DME Holdings, Inc. (DME Holdings) preferred shares issued at inception of the durable medical equipment business in September 2018 (see Note 13 - Non-Controlling Interests and Preferred Stock of Subsidiary in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In addition, management and monitoring expenses, which are payable to Great Elm DME Manager, LLC (DME Manager), a subsidiary of the Company in the general corporate segment, and one of the former owners of the durable medical equipment businesses, are included in other expense.\nInvestment Management\nThe key metrics of our investment management business include:\n \u25aa Assets under management - which provides the basis on which our management fees and performance milestones for vesting of certain equity awards are based \n \u25aa Investment performance - on which our incentive fees (if any) are based and on which we are measured against our competition \nThe following table provides the results of our investment management business for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018:\n\n (1) Investment management revenues are net of incentive fee reversals determined based upon a hypothetical liquidation of net assets at period end. The incentive fee reversals are primarily related to the conversion of Avanti Communications Group plc (Avanti) third lien notes, an investment owned by GECC, to common equity. \nInvestment Management Revenue\nInvestment management revenues include management fees and administration fees related to the management of GECC. For the year ended June 30, 2018, investment management revenues also included incentive fees from the management of GECC. As a result of the adoption of Topic 606 on July 1, 2018, incentive fees were not recognized for the year ended June 30, 2019. See Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFor the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, we recognized $3.0 million and $2.6 million, respectively, of management fee revenue and $0.9 million and $1.3 million, respectively, of administration fee revenue. The increase in management fee revenue for the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to an increase in the average assets on which such fees are calculated. Administration fees for the year ended June 30, 2018 included one-time costs associated with organizational restructuring and staffing changes at the Company which increased the costs on which the administration fees are based.\nInvestment Management Costs and Expenses\nOther general and administrative costs consist primarily of payroll and related costs, excluding stock-based compensation, professional fees, facilities and other overhead costs. For the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, facilities costs were $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively. The year over year decrease is primarily attributable to the Company moving to lower cost office space in October of 2017, as well as growth of the general corporate business resulting in lower allocation of shared expenses for the investment management business. Other overhead costs have remained consistent at approximately $0.3 million for each year.\nProfessional fees were less than $0.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2019; however, for the year ended June 30, 2018, professional fees were $0.2 million as a result of non-recurring costs incurred in connection with the September 2017 separation from MAST Capital (MAST Separation).\nFor the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, payroll and related costs, excluding stock-based compensation, were approximately $2.3 million and $3.2 million, respectively. The decrease in payroll and related costs for the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to the growth of the Company resulting in approximately $0.8 million in allocations of certain management personnel costs to the other business segments.\nThe decrease in stock-based compensation for the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to certain non-recurring costs recognized in connection with the MAST Separation. These non-recurring costs include:\n \u25aa the elimination of the vesting provisions and call rights for the GECC GP Corp. stock owned by certain employees of the Company resulting in stock-based compensation expense equal to the estimated fair value of the non-controlling interest in GECC GP Corp. held by those employees of $1.5 million; and \n \u25aa the restructuring of compensation arrangements for remaining employees resulting in higher stock-based compensation awarded in lieu of reductions in salaries for those employees. For the year ended June 30, 2019 these increases were partially offset by reversals of previously accrued stock-based compensation due to updated estimates related to the vesting criteria for certain performance-based awards. \nGECM has a consulting agreement with a third party to provide services in exchange for 26% of the fees earned from the management of GECC, excluding incentive fees. The increase in the costs associated with this consulting agreement for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 are consistent with the corresponding increases in management fee revenue for the same periods.\nReal Estate\nThe key metrics of our real estate business include rental revenues, depreciation on rental properties and interest expense on the related debt.\nThe following table provides the results of our real estate business for the year ended June 30, 2019 and the period from its inception in March 2018 to June 30, 2018 (the RE inception period):\n\nReal Estate Revenue\nFor the year ended June 30, 2019 and the RE inception period, we recognized $5.5 million and $1.9 million of rental revenue in connection with our recently acquired Class A office buildings in Fort Myers, Florida. The increase in revenue is due to having a full year of operations for the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to approximately four months for the RE inception period.\nReal Estate Costs and Expenses\nOur real estate business' costs primarily consist of management fees, insurance and state sales tax, depreciation of real estate assets and the amortization of the in-place lease intangible assets. For the year ended June 30, 2019 and the RE inception period depreciation was $1.2 million and $0.4 million, respectively, and amortization was $0.5 million and $0.2 million, respectively. In addition, we incurred $2.7 million and $0.9 million, respectively, of interest expense in connection with the Senior Note and Subordinated Note (each as defined herein) for the year ended June 30, 2019 and the RE inception period. Increases in the current year as compared to the prior period are due to having a full year of operations.\nGeneral Corporate\nThe following table provides the results of our general corporate business for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018:\n\nGeneral Corporate Revenue\nFor the year ended June 30, 2019, all revenue was derived from fees earned by DME Manager, which provides consulting services to DME Inc. Both DME Manager and DME Inc. were formed in connection with the acquisition of the durable medical equipment businesses in September 2018 and there was no corresponding activity prior to this acquisition.\nGeneral Corporate Costs and Expenses\nOur general and administrative costs primarily consisted of professional fees, payroll and facility costs for our finance, legal and other administrative functions as well as professional fees and payroll costs in connection with our diligence efforts towards identifying asset and business acquisition opportunities. For the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, professional fees in relation to the diligence of such opportunities were $1.6 million and $1.1 million, respectively. The increase in such professional fees for the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2018 was primarily driven by the significant acquisition of our durable medical equipment business in September 2018.\nThe increase in other general and administrative costs for the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the prior year was primarily driven by an increase of approximately $1.0 million in professional fees for external audit and other accounting advisory services and approximately $0.6 million in additional payroll and related costs, excluding stock-based compensation. The increases in payroll and related costs were partially offset by the $0.5 million reduction in stock-based compensation for the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2018.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther income and expense primarily consisted of dividend income and unrealized gains or losses on the Company's investment in GECC and interest income earned on cash balances. Dividend income for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 was $1.7 million and $2.4 million, respectively. During the year ended June 30, 2019, a portion of the Company's investment in GECC had been allocated to the durable medical equipment segment due to collateral requirements of the related party qualified preferred shares issued by DME Holdings in connection with the acquisition of the durable medical equipment businesses. This resulted in a decrease of $0.6 million in dividend income for the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the dividend income for the year ended June 30, 2018.\nWe recognized unrealized losses of $0.2 million and $2.7 million, respectively, for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. We mark-to-market our investment in GECC by reference to the closing price of GECC common stock on Nasdaq as of each period end.\nIncome Taxes\nAlthough in the aggregate we expect to owe no federal taxes for the year ended June 30, 2019, we are required to provide intra period taxes allocated between continuing operations and discontinued operations. During 2019, the Company recognized an income tax benefit with respect to discontinued operations of $1.3 million related to intraperiod allocations. In addition, the Company recognized an income tax benefit with respect to deferred tax liabilities of $0.9 million acquired in the durable medical equipment acquisition. State and local taxes were approximately $0.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2019.\nSummary of Discontinued Operations\nOn June 30, 2016, the Company sold two of its previously wholly-owned subsidiaries (the Divestiture) engaged in the patent licensing business for an aggregate purchase price of up to $40 million. The purchaser paid the Company $30 million, plus certain adjustments, upon the closing of the Divestiture, and had made claims that it had incurred indemnifiable losses in excess of the remaining $10 million due under the purchase and sale agreement.\nOn January 21, 2019, we entered into a mutual release and settlement agreement with the purchaser resulting in the release of any indemnifiable liabilities and an incremental cash receipt of $1.5 million. Prior to the execution of this settlement, the Company had determined that a loss related to final settlement with the purchaser was not realizable or estimable, and therefore had not accrued for any losses; however, the recognition of a portion of proceeds received associated with the former patent licensing business had been deferred pending finalization of all contingencies. The settlement resulted in a $5.0 million gain in discontinued operations during the year ended June 30, 2019, consisting of the extinguishment of related liabilities of $3.6 million and the receipt of cash of $1.5 million from the purchaser, partially offset by legal fees of $0.1 million. The net income from discontinued operations includes these gains, offset by a tax provision of $1.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2019.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the Company's discontinued operations for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018:\n\n (1) During the year ended June 30, 2018, we incurred discontinued operating costs of $0.2 million related to the representations and warranties associated with the disposal of our legacy patent licensing business. \nNet Revenues\nAs a result of the settlement during the year ended June 30, 2019, we recognized $1.5 million in net revenues for the period. There were no revenues related to discontinued operations for the year ended June 30, 2018.\nExtinguishment of Liabilities\nAs a result of the settlement during the year ended June 30, 2019, $3.6 million of liabilities related to the discontinued operations were extinguished.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nDuring the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, the general and administrative expenses of our discontinued operations related primarily to the work associated with settling claims on the representations and warranties in connection with the Divestiture.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table presents selected financial information and statistics as of June 30, 2019 and 2018:\n\n\nWorking Capital and Cash Flows\nAs of June 30, 2019, we had a cash balance of $12.1 million. We also own 1,966,667 shares of GECC common stock with an estimated fair value of $17.1 million as of June 30, 2019.\nWe intend to make acquisitions that will likely result in our investment of all of our liquid financial resources, the issuance of equity securities and the incurrence of indebtedness. If we are unsuccessful at raising additional capital resources, through either debt or equity, it is unlikely we will be able execute our strategic growth plan. See Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nCash Provided by or Used in Operating Activities. Cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $2.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. Cash flows used in operating activities totaled $3.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2018.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2019, net cash provided by operating activities for continuing operations consisted primarily of the net loss of $3.1 million and gain on discontinued operations of $3.7 million offset by non-cash activity, including $9.2 million of depreciation and amortization. Changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in net cash used in operating activities of $3.0 million, primarily consisting of an increase in accounts receivable of $2.8 million and decrease in operating leases of $1.1 million offset by increases in related party payables of $0.8 million. These changes in operating assets and liabilities are primarily related to operational changes as a result of the acquisition of our durable medical equipment businesses during the year.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2018, net cash used in operating activities consisted primarily of the following revenues and expenses: $4.1 million of investment management revenue received; $1.9 million of real estate revenue received; $4.3 million of cash based compensation and benefits paid to our employees; $1.4 million of costs incurred in the investigation and diligence of acquisition opportunities; $1.7 million of professional fees incurred; $0.4 million of real estate administrative expenses; $0.7 million of consulting fees and $0.8 million of rental and insurance expenses.\nCash Used in Investing Activities. Cash flows used in investing activities totaled $54.9 million and $2.4 million for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. For the year ended June 30, 2019 investing activities primarily consist of $48.1 million spent in the acquisitions of our durable medical equipment businesses in September 2018 and June 2019, as well as the purchase of $6.8 million in equipment held for rental and another $0.8 million in fixed assets related to the durable medical equipment business.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2018, investing activities primarily relate to the acquisition of our initial real estate assets.\nCash Provided by Financing Activities. Cash flows provided by financing activities totaled $21.5 million and $3.9 million for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. For the year ended June 30, 2019, cash inflows of approximately $19.9 million and $6.6 million were provided by net proceeds on the note payable from a seller and a revolving line of credit, respectively, established with the acquisition of the durable medical equipment business, including additional draws made during the year. Additionally, $1.6 million was provided by proceeds from equipment financing arrangements and $1.4 million was provided by the exercise of warrants in July 2018. These inflows were partially offset by principal payments of $2.8 million on our long term debt and related party notes payable, as well as $5.1 million paid to redeem the preferred stock of a subsidiary during the year ended June 30, 2019.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2018, financing activities primarily related to the exercise of warrants resulting in cash proceeds of $4.6 million and the issuance of 1,266,000 shares of our common stock. This cash inflow was partially offset by payments made on the Senior Note payable related to our real estate business of $0.6 million.\nBorrowings\nAs of June 30, 2019, we had a note due to a non-controlling interest holder of DME Inc., Corbel Capital Partners SBIC, L.P., totaling $27.6 million that accrues interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 10.0% (at June 30, 2019, the effective interest rate was 12.32%) through maturity on August 31, 2023 (the Corbel Facility). The Corbel Facility requires quarterly interest payments along with principal payments of $0.3 million plus an additional amount based on excess cash flows, if any, generated by the durable medical equipment business operations. The Corbel Facility is secured by all of the assets of the durable medical equipment business and the Company is required to meet certain financial covenants.\nThe Company has the option to prepay the borrowings outstanding under the Corbel Facility in whole or in part subject to certain prepayment penalties ranging from 1.0% - 5.0% of the early payment of the principal, based on the time that the Corbel Facility has been outstanding through the first five years of the loan.\nDME Inc. is required to pay to Corbel, as agent of the Corbel Facility, a quarterly monitoring fee of $25,000 per quarter while the borrowings remain outstanding. In addition, if the borrowing is repaid with proceeds of debt in full or in part at any time within the first three years from the date of issuance, the borrower shall pay an additional fee to the agent, ranging from 2.10% to 3.50% depending on the date of repayment based on the period outstanding, of the aggregate repaid principal amount.\nAs of June 30, 2019, we had a credit facility due to Pacific Mercantile Bank totaling $7.4 million that accrues interest at the prime rate plus 0.40% (at June 30, 2019, the effective rate was 5.90%) through maturity on August 30, 2020 (the DME Revolver). The DME Revolver allows for borrowings up to $10 million. The DME Revolver requires monthly interest payments. The DME Revolver is secured by all of the assets of the durable medical equipment business and the Company is required to meet certain financial covenants.\nThe Corbel Facility and DME Revolver each include covenants that restrict DME Inc. business operations to its current business, limit additional indebtedness, liens, asset dispositions and investments, require compliance and maintenance of licenses and government approvals and other customary conditions. Events of default include the failure to pay amounts when due, bankruptcy, or violation of covenants, including a change in control of DME Inc. DME Inc. must also comply with a fixed-charge coverage and leverage ratio financial covenants, which are based in part on the DME Inc. EBITDA levels.\nAs of June 30, 2019, we had a related party note due to MAST Capital (the GP Corp. Note) totaling $3.1 million that accrues interest at a variable rate of three-month LIBOR plus 3.0%, as adjusted for each 90-day period (at June 30, 2019, the effective rate was 5.32%) through maturity on November 3, 2026. The GP Corp. Note requires minimum annual principal payments of $0.08 million and quarterly interest-only payments. The GP Corp. Note is secured by the profit sharing agreement between GECM and GECC GP Corp. (the Profit Sharing Agreement) that transfers profits generated by our management of GECC, with no recourse to any of our other assets, entities or operations.\nThe GP Corp. Note is non-recourse to any of the Company's operations or net assets not related to GECM's management services to GECC. The GP Corp. Note may be prepaid at par value at any time with prior written notice to the holders of the GP Corp. Note. Additionally, GECC GP Corp. is required to prepay the GP Corp. Note upon certain material liquidation transactions including any termination of the Profit Sharing Agreement.\nAs of June 30, 2019, we had a senior note due to Wells Fargo Bank Northwest, National totaling $52.2 million that accrues interest at a rate of 3.49% through maturity on March 15, 2030 (the Senior Note). The Senior Note requires monthly principal and interest payments through the maturity date. The Senior Note is secured by a first lien mortgage on the Property and an Assignment of Leases and Rents, with no recourse to any of our assets, entities or operations.\nThe principal and interest due on the Senior Note may be prepaid at the option of the borrower, based on an amount determined by discounting the remaining principal and interest payments at a rate equal to an applicable premium in excess of a rate corresponding to the specified U.S. Treasury security over the remaining average life of the Senior Note.\nAs of June 30, 2019, we had a subordinated note due to Wells Fargo Bank Northwest, National totaling $3.3 million that accrues interest at a rate of 15.00% through maturity on March 15, 2030 (the Subordinated Note). The Subordinated Note is a capital appreciation note, whereby the monthly interest is capitalized to the principal balance and due at maturity. The Subordinated Note is secured by a second lien mortgage on the Property, and an Assignment of Leases and Rents, with no recourse to any of our assets, entities or operations.\nThe principal and interest due on the Subordinated Note may be prepaid at the option of the borrower, based on an amount determined by discounting the remaining principal and interest payments at a rate equal to an applicable premium in excess of a rate corresponding to the specified U.S. Treasury security over the remaining average life of the Subordinated Note.\nThe note agreements for both the Senior Note and the Subordinated Note include negative covenants that restrict the Company's majority-owned subsidiary, CRIC IT Fort Myers LLC's (the Property Owner) business operations to ownership and lease of the Property, limit additional indebtedness, require maintenance of insurance and other customary requirements related to the Property. Events of default include non-payment of amounts when due, inability to pay indebtedness or material change in the business operations or financial condition of the Property Owner or the lease tenant that in the lender's reasonable determination would reasonably be expected to materially impair the value of the Property, prevent timely repayment of the notes or performance of any material obligations under the note and related agreements. The payments under the notes are also guaranteed on a full and several basis by the non-controlling interest holder of the Property Owner. Both the Senior Note and Subordinated Note are non-recourse to the Company, but are secured by the Property, the rights associated with the leases and the stock owned by the Company in the Property Owner.\nBeginning in April 2019, DME Inc's operating subsidiaries also utilize equipment financing debt to fund certain inventory and equipment purchases from suppliers. These equipment financing debt agreements are entered into with 3rd party banks and are generally payable in equal installments over terms of one to three years, depending on the nature of the underlying purchases being financed. The debt is secured by the inventory and equipment, as applicable, of the operating subsidiaries entering into the agreements, and the long-term agreements have implicit interest rates between 7 - 8%. During the year ended June 30, 2019, the Company financed $1.6 million in inventory and equipment through such financing agreements.\nContractual Obligations\nOur contractual obligations as of June 30, 2019 are presented in the table below:\n\n (1) Includes estimated interest based on an interest rate of 12.32%, the 3-month LIBOR plus 10%, as of June 30, 2019. \n (2) Includes estimated interest based on an interest rate of 5.90%, the prime rate plus 0.40% as of June 30, 2019. \n (3) Includes estimated interest based on an interest rate of 5.32%, the 3-month LIBOR plus 3% as of June 30, 2019. \nRestrictions on Subsidiary Dividends\nIn the GP Corp.

we did not invest in any off-balance sheet vehicles that provide financing, liquidity, market or credit risk support or engage in any leasing activities that expose us to any liability that is not reflected in our consolidated financial statements.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial
