Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under the caption Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of programmed cellular immunotherapies for cancer and immune disorders. We are developing first-in-class cell therapy product candidates based on a simple notion: we believe that better cell therapies start with better cells.\nTo create better cell therapies, we use a therapeutic approach that we generally refer to as cell programming. For certain of our product candidates, we use pharmacologic modulators, such as small molecules, to enhance the biological properties and therapeutic function of healthy donor cells ex vivo before our product candidates are administered to a patient. In other cases, we use human iPSCs to generate a clonal master iPSC line having preferred biological properties, and direct the fate of the clonal master iPSC line to create our cell therapy product candidate. Analogous to master cell lines used to manufacture biopharmaceutical drug products such as monoclonal antibodies, we believe clonal master iPSC lines can be used as a renewable source for manufacturing cell therapy products which are well-defined and uniform in composition, can be repeatedly mass produced at significant scale in a cost-effective manner, and can be delivered off-the-shelf to treat many patients. Utilizing these therapeutic approaches, we program cells of the blood and immune system, including natural killer (NK) cells, T cells and CD34+ cells, and are advancing a pipeline of programmed cellular immunotherapies in the therapeutic areas of immuno-oncology and immuno-regulation.\nWe have entered into a research collaboration and license agreement with the Regents of the University of Minnesota to develop off-the-shelf NK cell cancer immunotherapies derived from clonal master iPSC lines. Additionally, we have entered into a research collaboration and license agreement with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (Memorial Sloan Kettering) to develop off-the-shelf, engineered T-cell cancer immunotherapies derived from clonal master iPSC lines.\nWe have entered into a collaboration and option agreement with Ono Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. for the joint development and commercialization of two off-the-shelf iPSC-derived CAR T-cell product candidates.\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in 2007, and are headquartered in San Diego, CA. Since our inception in 2007, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to our cell programming approach and the research and development of our product candidates, the creation, licensing and protection of related intellectual property, and the provision of general and administrative support for these activities. To date, we have funded our operations primarily through the public and private sale of common stock, the private placement of preferred stock and convertible notes, commercial bank debt and revenues from collaboration activities and grants.\nWe have never been profitable and have incurred net losses in each year since inception. Substantially all of our net losses resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We expect to continue to incur operating losses for at least the foreseeable future. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. We expect our expenses will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing and planned activities as we:\nTable 195: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> conduct our clinical trial of ProTmune under our own Investigational New Drug application;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 196: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> conduct our clinical trials of FATE-NK100, including under investigator-sponsored clinical trial agreements with the University of Minnesota and under our own IND application;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 197: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> conduct our clinical trials of FT500 and FT516 under our own IND applications;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 198: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> conduct GMP manufacture, process development and technology transfer activities for the production of our product candidates, including those undergoing clinical investigation and IND-enabling preclinical development;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 199: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> source clinical supplies and materials used to manufacture our product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 200: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> conduct preclinical research, process development, manufacturing and development activities to support the clinical translation of our first-in-class product candidates derived from master iPSC lines;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 201: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> conduct clinical trials of our product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 202: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> build-out our own GMP manufacturing capabilities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 203: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> continue our research and development activities, including under our collaboration agreement with Ono;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 204: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> maintain, prosecute, protect, expand and enforce our intellectual property portfolio;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 205: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> engage with regulatory authorities for the development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 206: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> hire additional clinical, manufacturing, regulatory, quality control and technical personnel to advance our product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 207: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> hire additional scientific personnel to advance our research and development efforts; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 208: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> hire general and administrative personnel to continue operating as a public company and support our operations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe do not expect to generate any revenues from sales of any therapeutic products unless and until we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval for one or more of our product candidates, which we expect will take a number of years. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. Accordingly, we will seek to fund our operations through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements when needed would have a negative effect on our financial condition and ability to develop our product candidates.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nWe conduct substantially all of our activities through Fate Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation, at our facilities in San Diego, California. Fate Therapeutics, Inc. owns 100% of the voting shares of Fate Therapeutics Ltd. (Fate Ltd.), incorporated in the United Kingdom, whose operations have not been material to date. Effective May 2018, Fate Therapeutics, Inc. owns 100% of the voting shares of Tfinity Therapeutics, Inc. (Tfinity) and previously owned the majority of the voting shares of Tfinity and controlled Tfinity for consolidation purposes. To date, Tfinity has not had any material operations. The following information is presented on a consolidated basis to include the accounts of Fate Therapeutics, Inc., Tfinity, and Fate Ltd. All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation.\nIn February 2019, Fate Therapeutics B.V. (Fate B.V.), a wholly owned subsidiary of Fate Therapeutics, Inc. was incorporated in the Netherlands. The operations have Fate B.V. have not been material to date.\nCollaboration Revenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenues from therapeutic product sales. Our revenues have been derived from collaboration agreements and government grants.\nAgreement with Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.\nOn September 14, 2018, we entered into a Collaboration and Option Agreement (the Ono Agreement) with Ono Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (Ono) for the joint development and commercialization of two off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived CAR T-cell product candidates. Pursuant to the terms of the Ono Agreement, we received an upfront, non-refundable and non-creditable payment of $10.0 million. Additionally, we are entitled to receive fees for the conduct of research and preclinical development under a joint development plan, which fees are estimated to be $20.0 million in aggregate (of which $5.0 million was received in October 2018).\nWe concluded that Ono represented a customer and in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, we determined that the initial transaction price under the Ono Agreement equals $30.0 million, consisting of the upfront, non-refundable and non-creditable payment of $10.0 million and the aggregate estimated research and development fees of $20.0 million. In addition, we identified our performance obligations under the Ono Agreement, including our grant of a license to Ono to certain of our intellectual property subject to certain conditions, our conduct of research services, and our participation in a joint steering committee. We determined that all performance obligations should be accounted for as one combined performance obligation since no individual performance obligation is distinct, and that the combined performance obligation is transferred over the expected term of the conduct of the research services, which is estimated to be four years.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized $0.6 million of collaboration revenue under the Ono Agreement. As of December 31, 2018, aggregate deferred revenue related to the Ono Agreement was $14.4 million.\nAgreement with Juno Therapeutics, Inc.\nOn May 4, 2015, we entered into a strategic research collaboration and license agreement (the Juno Agreement) with Juno Therapeutics, Inc. (Juno) to screen for and identify small molecule modulators that enhance the therapeutic properties of Juno's genetically-engineered T-cell immunotherapies. Pursuant to the terms of the Juno Agreement, we received an upfront, non-refundable and non-creditable payment of $5.0 million and Juno purchased 1,000,000 shares of our common stock at $8.00 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $8.0 million. Additionally, we have received, and are entitled to receive, minimum annual research payments of $2.0 million for the conduct of research services during the initial four-year term of the Juno Agreement.\nWe determined that the common stock purchase by Juno represented a premium of $3.40 per share, or $3.4 million in aggregate (Equity Premium), and the remaining $4.6 million was recorded as issuance of common stock in shareholders' equity.\nIn accordance with ASC 606, we determined that the transaction price under the Juno Agreement equals $16.4 million, consisting of the upfront, non-refundable and non-creditable payment of $5.0 million, the $3.4 million Equity Premium and $8.0 million of estimated payments for the conduct of research services during the initial four-year term. In addition, we identified our performance obligations under the Juno Agreement, including our grant of an exclusive worldwide license to certain of our intellectual property subject to certain conditions, our conduct of research services and our participation in a joint research committee. We determined that all performance obligations should be accounted for as one combined performance obligation since no individual performance obligation is distinct, and that the combined performance obligation is transferred ratably over the expected term of conduct of the research services, which is four years.\nIn connection with the Juno Agreement, we have recognized $4.1 million and $4.1 million, respectively, during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, as collaboration revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. As of December 31, 2018, aggregate deferred revenue related to the Juno Agreement was $0.7 million.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist of costs associated with the research, preclinical development, manufacture and clinical development of our product candidates, the research and development of our cell programming technology including our iPSC product platform, and the performance of research and development activities under our collaboration agreements. These costs are expensed as incurred and include:\nTable 209: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> salaries and employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 210: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> costs incurred under clinical trial agreements with investigative sites;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 211: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> costs to acquire, develop and manufacture preclinical study and clinical trial materials, including our product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 212: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> costs associated with conducting our preclinical, process development, manufacturing, clinical and regulatory activities, including fees paid to third-party professional consultants, service providers and suppliers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 213: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> costs incurred under our collaboration agreements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 214: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> costs for research, laboratory and manufacturing materials and supplies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 215: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> costs incurred to license and maintain intellectual property; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 216: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> facilities, depreciation and other expenses including allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe plan to increase our current level of research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue the clinical and preclinical development of our product candidates, research and develop our cell programming technology including our iPSC product platform, and perform our obligations under collaboration agreements including under our agreements with Ono, University of Minnesota and Memorial Sloan Kettering. Our current planned research and development activities over the next twelve months consist primarily of the following:\nTable 217: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> conducting clinical trials of our product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 218: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> conducting GMP manufacture, process development and technology transfer activities for the production of our product candidates, including those undergoing clinical investigation and IND-enabling preclinical development;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 219: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> source clinical supplies and materials used to manufacture our product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 220: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> conducting preclinical research, process development, manufacturing and clinical translation activities to investigate the therapeutic potential of our immuno-oncology product candidates, and initiating and conducting first-in-human clinical trials of such product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 221: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> conducting preclinical research and process development activities to investigate the therapeutic potential of our immuno-regulatory product candidates; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 222: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> performing research, preclinical development, process development, manufacturing and clinical translation activities under our sponsored research and collaboration agreements, including our agreements with Ono, University of Minnesota and Memorial Sloan Kettering.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDue to the inherently unpredictable nature of preclinical and clinical development, and given our novel therapeutic approach and the current stage of development of our product candidates, we cannot determine and are unable to estimate with certainty the timelines we will require and the costs we will incur for the development of our product candidates, including ProTmune, FATE-NK100, FT500, FT516 and our other product candidates derived from clonal master iPSC lines. Clinical and preclinical development timelines and costs, and the potential of development success, can differ materially from expectations. In addition, we cannot forecast which product candidates may be subject to future collaborations, when such arrangements will be secured, if at all, and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation, for our employees in executive, operational, finance and human resource functions; professional fees for accounting, legal and tax services; costs for obtaining, prosecuting and maintaining our intellectual property; and other costs and fees, including director and officer insurance premiums, to support our operations as a public company. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our research and development activities, maintain compliance with exchange listing and SEC requirements and continue to operate as a public company.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther income (expense) consists primarily of interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents, interest income from short-term investments (including the amortization of discounts and premiums), and interest expense.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to accrued expenses and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report, we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant procedures, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update 2014-09 (ASU 2014-09), Topic 606, which created a single, principle-based revenue recognition model that supersedes and replaces nearly all existing U.S. GAAP revenue recognition guidance. We adopted ASU 2014-09 in the first quarter of 2018 using the full retrospective method. We evaluated the effect that the updated standard had on our internal processes, financial statements and related disclosures, and we determined that the adoption did not have a material impact on our historical consolidated financial statements.\nWe recognize revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of control of a product or a service to a customer and reflects the amount of the consideration we are entitled to receive in exchange for such product or service. In doing so, we follow a five-step approach: (i) identify the contract with a customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the customer obtains control of the product or service. We consider the terms of a contract and all relevant facts and circumstances when applying the revenue recognition standard. We apply the revenue recognition standard, including the use of any practical expedients, consistently to contracts with similar characteristics and in similar circumstances.\nA customer is a party that has entered into a contract with us, where the purpose of the contract is to obtain a product or a service that is an output of our ordinary activities in exchange for consideration. To be considered a contract, (i) the contract must be approved (in writing, orally, or in accordance with other customary business practices), (ii) each party's rights regarding the product or the service to be transferred can be identified, (iii) the payment terms for the product or the service to be transferred can be identified, (iv) the contract must have commercial substance (that is, the risk, timing or amount of future cash flows is expected to change as a result of the contract), and (v) it is probable that we will collect substantially all of the consideration to which we are entitled to receive in exchange for the transfer of the product or the service.\nA performance obligation is defined as a promise to transfer a product or a service to a customer. We identify each promise to transfer a product or a service (or a bundle of products or services, or a series of products and services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer) that is distinct. A product or a service is distinct if both (i) the customer can benefit from the product or the service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer and (ii) our promise to transfer the product or the service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. Each distinct promise to transfer a product or a service is a unit of accounting for revenue recognition. If a promise to transfer a product or a service is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contract, such promises should be combined into a single performance obligation.\nThe transaction price is the amount of consideration we are entitled to receive in exchange for the transfer of control of a product or a service to a customer. To determine the transaction price, we consider the existence of any significant financing component, the effects of any variable elements, noncash considerations and consideration payable to the customer. If a significant financing component exists, the transaction price is adjusted for the time value of money. If an element of variability exists, we must estimate the consideration we expect to receive and use that amount as the basis for recognizing revenue as the product or the service is transferred to the customer. There are two methods for determining the amount of variable consideration: (i) the expected value method, which is the sum of probability-weighted amounts in a range of possible consideration amounts, and (ii) the mostly likely amount method, which identifies the single most likely amount in a range of possible consideration amounts.\nIf a contract has multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in an amount that reflects the consideration we are entitled to receive in exchange for satisfying each distinct performance obligation. For each distinct performance obligation, revenue is recognized when (or as) we transfer control of the product or the service applicable to such performance obligation. To date, for collaboration arrangements that represent a single performance obligation, the revenues are recognized over time based on costs incurred compared to total estimated costs.\nIn those instances where we first receive consideration in advance of satisfying its performance obligation, we classify such consideration as deferred revenue until (or as) we satisfy such performance obligation. In those instances where we first satisfy our performance obligation prior to our receipt of consideration, the consideration is recorded as accounts receivable.\nWe expense incremental costs of obtaining a contract as and when incurred if the expected amortization period of the asset that would be recognized is one year or less, or if the amount of the asset is immaterial.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. Examples of accrued research and development expenses include amounts owed to clinical research organizations, to investigative sites in connection with clinical trials, to sponsored research organizations, to service providers in connection with preclinical development activities and to service providers related to product manufacturing, development and distribution of clinical supplies.\nWe base our accrued expenses related to clinical trials on our estimates of the services performed and efforts expended pursuant to our contractual arrangements, including those with clinical research organizations. The financial terms of these agreements are sometimes subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our service providers will exceed the level of services performed and result in a prepayment of the clinical expense. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical milestones. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid accordingly.\nAlthough we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from expenses actually incurred, if our estimates of the status and timing of services performed differs from the actual status and timing of services performed, we may report amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have been no material differences from our estimates to the amounts actually incurred.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense represents the grant date fair value of employee stock option and restricted stock unit grants recognized over the requisite service period of the awards (usually the vesting period) on a straight-line basis. For stock option grants with performance-based milestones, the expense is recorded over the remaining service period after the point when the achievement of the milestone is probable or the performance condition has been achieved. For stock option grants with both performance-based milestones and market conditions, expense is recorded over the derived service period after the point when the achievement of the performance-based milestone is probable or the performance condition has been achieved. We estimate the fair value of stock option grants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, with the exception of option grants with both performance-based milestones and market conditions, which are valued using a lattice based model. The fair value of restricted stock units is based on the closing price of our common stock as reported on The NASDAQ Global Market on the date of grant.\nWe account for stock options and restricted stock awards to non-employees using the fair value approach. Stock options and restricted stock awards to non-employees are subject to periodic revaluation over their vesting terms. For stock option grants with performance-based milestones, the expense is recorded over the remaining service period after the point when the performance condition is determined to be probable of achievement or when it has been achieved.\nWe generally estimate the fair value of our stock option awards to employees and non-employees using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including (a) the risk-free interest rate, (b) the expected volatility of our stock, (c) the expected term of the award and (d) the expected dividend yield. Due to the lack of an adequate history of a public market for the trading of our common stock and a lack of adequate company specific historical and implied volatility data, we have based our estimate of expected volatility on the historical volatility of a group of similar companies that are publicly traded. For these analyses, we have selected companies with comparable characteristics to ours including enterprise value, risk profiles, position within the industry, and with historical share price information sufficient to meet the expected life of the stock-based awards. We compute the historical volatility data using the daily closing prices for the selected companies' shares during the equivalent period of the calculated expected term of our stock-based awards. We will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available. We have estimated the expected life of our employee stock options using the simplified\u201d method, whereby, the expected life equals the average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option. The risk-free interest rates for periods within the expected life of the option are based on the yields of zero-coupon U.S. Treasury securities. See Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nTotal stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, was $6.3 million, $3.6 million, and $3.2 million, respectively. Expense related to unvested employee stock option grants not yet recognized as of December 31, 2018 was approximately $15.9 million and the weighted-average period over which these grants are expected to vest is 3.1 years. As of December 31, 2018, the unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding restricted stock units was $0.4 million, which is expected to be recognized as expense over approximately 0.8 years.\nOther Company Information\nJOBS Act\nOn April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act), was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company\u201d can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. As of December 31, 2018, we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company.\nSubject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, as we are no longer an emerging growth company,\u201d we are subject to certain additional requirements, including without limitation, (i) providing an auditor's attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) complying with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements, known as the auditor discussion and analysis.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements, please see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nThe following table summarizes the results of our operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 223: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase/\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Collaboration revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,740\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 56,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,935\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other (income) expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (494\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,321\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue.

As of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $285.4 million and anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of the net cash flow activity for each of the years ended December 31:\nTable 239: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (38,650\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (36,817\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (29,823\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (463\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10,196\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,114\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 140,780\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 47,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 57,737\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 101,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nCash used in operating activities increased from $36.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $38.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The primary driver of this change in cash used in operating activities was our increase in net loss from 2017 to 2018, partially offset by an increase of $14.4 million in deferred revenue resulting primarily from entering into our collaboration agreement with Ono and a one-time, non-cash expense of $6.1 million incurred from the issuance of common stock to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Gladstone in connection with those license agreements.\nCash used in operating activities increased from $29.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $36.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The primary driver of this change in cash used in operating activities was our increase in net loss from 2016 to 2017, partially offset by an increase of $1.0 million in deferred rent resulting from the office and lab expansion in January 2017 and an increase of $1.0 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses.\nAgreement with Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.\nOn September 14, 2018, we entered into the Ono Agreement with Ono for the joint development and commercialization of two off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived CAR T-cell product candidates (each a Candidate and collectively the Candidates). Under the terms of the Ono Agreement, Ono paid to us an upfront, non-refundable and non-creditable payment of $10.0 million. Additionally, as consideration for our conduct of research and preclinical development under a joint development plan, Ono pays us annual research and development fees set forth in the annual budget included in the joint development plan, which fees are estimated to be $20.0 million in aggregate over the course of the joint development plan. Further, under the terms of the Ono Agreement, Ono has agreed to pay us up to an additional $40.0 million, subject to the achievement of a preclinical milestone and the exercise by Ono of its options to obtain exclusive licenses to develop and commercialize the Candidates. Such fees are in addition to the upfront payment and research and development fees.\nSubject to Ono's exercise of its options to obtain exclusive licenses to develop and commercialize the Candidates and to the achievement of certain clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones with respect to each Candidate in specified territories, we are entitled to receive an aggregate of up to $285.0 million in milestone payments for Candidate 1 and an aggregate of up to $895.0 million in milestone payments for Candidate 2, with the applicable milestone payments for Candidate 2 for the United States and Europe subject to reduction by 50% if we elect to co-develop and co-commercialize Candidate 2 as described above. As of December 31, 2018, we have not received any such milestone payments. We are also eligible to receive tiered royalties ranging from the mid-single digits to the low-double digits based on annual net sales by Ono of each Candidate in specified territories, with such royalties subject to certain reductions. As of December 31, 2018, no royalties have been paid to us.\nAs a direct result of our entry into the Ono Agreement, we incurred an aggregate of $2.0 million in sublicense consideration to existing licensors of ours. The $2.0 million sublicense consideration represents an asset under ASC 340, Other Assets and Deferred Costs. As of December 31, 2018, $1.0 million of such consideration has been paid, while the remaining $1.0 million remains in account payable.\nAgreement with Juno Therapeutics, Inc.\nOn May 4, 2015, we entered into a strategic research collaboration and license agreement with Juno to screen for and identify small molecule modulators that enhance the therapeutic properties of Juno's genetically-engineered T-cell immunotherapies. Pursuant to the terms of the Juno Agreement, Juno paid us an upfront, non-refundable and non-creditable payment of $5.0 million, and purchased one million shares of our common stock, at $8.00 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $8.0 million. Additionally, Juno agreed to fund all of our collaboration research activities for an initial four-year research term beginning on the effective date of the Juno Agreement, with minimum annual research payments of $2.0 million to us. Juno has the option to extend the exclusive research term for an additional two years beyond the initial four-year term, subject to the payment of a one-time, non-refundable extension fee of $3.0 million and the continued funding of our activities under the collaboration during the extended term, with minimum annual research payments of $4.0 million to us during the two-year extension period. As of December 31, 2018, we have received a total of $6.8 million of such research payments. We received a $0.5 million research payment during January 2019.\nWe are eligible under the Juno Agreement to receive selection fees for each tumor-associated antigen target selected by Juno and bonus selection fees based on the aggregate number of tumor-associated antigen targets selected by Juno. Additionally, in connection with each Juno therapy that uses or incorporates our small molecule modulators, Juno has agreed to pay us non-refundable, non-creditable milestone payments totaling up to approximately $51.0 million, in the aggregate, per therapy upon the achievement of various clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones. Additionally, in connection with the third Juno therapy and the fifth Juno therapy that uses or incorporates our small molecule modulators, Juno has agreed to pay us additional non-refundable, non-creditable bonus milestone payments totaling up to approximately $116.0 million and $137.5 million, respectively, in the aggregate, per therapy upon the achievement of various clinical, regulatory, and commercial milestones. As of December 31, 2018, we have not received any selection fees or milestone payments.\nBeginning on the date of the first commercial sale (in each country) for each Juno therapy that uses or incorporates our small molecule modulators, and continuing until the later of i) the expiration of the last valid patent claim, ii) ten years after such first commercial sale, or iii) the expiration of all data and other regulatory exclusivity periods afforded each therapy, Juno has agreed to pay us royalties in the low single-digits on net sales of each Juno therapy that uses or incorporates our small molecule modulators. As of December 31, 2018, no royalties have been paid to us.\nIn March 2018, Juno was acquired by Celgene Corporation (Celgene). This acquisition did not affect the terms of our agreement with Juno Agreement. On January 3, 2019, Celgene announced that it had entered into a definitive merger agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS), under which BMS will acquire Celgene.\nMemorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center License Agreement\nOn May 15, 2018, we entered into an Amended and Restated Exclusive License Agreement with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK). The agreement amends and restates the license agreement entered into between us and MSK on August 19, 2016. In consideration for the additional rights granted under the May 2018 agreement, we issued 500,000 shares of our common stock to MSK, which shares were valued at $4.8 million on the date of agreement. We also paid an upfront cash fee of $0.5 million, and we are obligated to pay milestone payments upon the achievement of specified clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones and royalty payments to MSK on net sales of licensed products. We are also obligated to pay MSK a percentage of certain sublicense income received by us. Furthermore, in the event a licensed product achieves a specified clinical milestone, MSK is then eligible to receive additional milestone payments, where the amount of such payments owed to MSK are contingent upon certain increases in the price of the Company's common stock following the date of achievement of such clinical milestone.\nJ. David Gladstone Institutes License Agreement\nOn September 11, 2018, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with the J. David Gladstone Institutes (Gladstone).

We also paid an upfront cash fee of $0.1 million, and we are obligated to pay milestone payments in an aggregate amount of up to approximately $1.9 million upon the achievement of specified clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones and as well as royalties to Gladstone in the low single digits on net sales of licensed products. We are also obligated to pay Gladstone a tiered percentage in the low to mid-single digits of certain sublicense income received by us.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, investing activities used cash of $0.5 million, $10.2 million and $4.1 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2018 we purchased $55.7 million in U.S. Treasuries as short-term investments, offset by $57.5 million in maturities of these short-term investments. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we purchased $40.0 million in U.S. Treasuries as short-term investments, offset by $31.5 million in maturities of these short-term investments. The remaining investing activities for the periods presented were primarily attributable to the purchase of property and equipment.\nFinancing Activities\nFinancing activities provided cash of $140.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which primarily consisted of the $134.9 million of net proceeds from our September 2018 public offering of common stock and $3.5 million of proceeds from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) award.\nFinancing activities provided cash of $47.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which primarily consisted of $43.2 million of net proceeds from our December 2017 public offering of common stock and $15.0 million of proceeds from the July 14, 2017 amendment to our loan agreement with Silicon Valley Bank, offset by $10.8 million of principal payments on our term loans outstanding with Silicon Valley Bank.\nFinancing activities provided cash of $57.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which primarily consisted of $36.4 million of net proceeds from our November 2016 private placement issuance of Class A convertible preferred stock, $18.6 million of net proceeds from our November 2016 private placement issuance of common stock and $10.2 million of net proceeds from our August 2016 private placement issuance of common stock, offset by $7.7 million of principal payments on our term loans outstanding with Silicon Valley Bank.\nFrom our inception through December 31, 2018 we have funded our consolidated operations primarily through the public and private sale of common stock, the private placement of preferred stock and convertible notes, commercial bank debt and revenues from collaboration activities and grants. As of December 31, 2018, we had aggregate cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $201.0 million.\nPublic Offering of Common Stock\nIn September 2018, we completed a public offering of common stock in which investors, certain of which are affiliated with our directors, purchased 10,648,149 shares of our common stock at a price of $13.50 per share under our shelf registration statement. Gross proceeds from the offering were $143.8 million. After giving effect to $8.9 million in underwriting discounts, commissions and expenses related to the offering, net proceeds were $134.9 million.\nIn December 2017, we completed a public offering of common stock in which investors purchased 10,953,750 shares of our common stock at a price of $4.20 per share under a shelf registration statement.

After giving effect to an estimated $3.0 million of costs related to the offering (of which $0.3 million was paid during 2018), net proceeds were $43.0 million.\nCalifornia Institute for Regenerative Medicine Award\nOn April 5, 2018, we executed an award agreement with CIRM pursuant to which CIRM awarded us up to $4.0 million to advance our FT516 product candidate into a first-in-human clinical trial for the treatment of subjects with advanced solid tumors, including in combination with monoclonal antibody therapy (the Award). Pursuant to the terms of the Award, we are eligible to receive five disbursements in varying amounts totaling $4.0 million throughout the project period of the Award, which was estimated to be from April 1, 2018 to June 30, 2019 (the Project Period). In December 2018, we discussed with CIRM our intent to pursue the clinical development of FT516 in relapsed / refractory hematologic malignancies in addition to advanced solid tumors, and our preference to first submit an IND application for FT516 in relapsed / refractory hematologic malignancies rather than in advanced solid tumors. In January 2019, we submitted our IND application for FT516 in relapsed / refractory hematologic malignancies, which IND submission was allowed by the FDA in February 2019. We agreed with CIRM to suspend the Award until such time as we elect to proceed with our submission of an IND application for FT516 in advanced solid tumors. At the time of suspension, an additional $0.5 million was available for funding under the Award.\nThe Award is subject to certain co-funding requirements by us. Following the conclusion of the Project Period, we, in our sole discretion, have the option to treat the Award either as a loan or as a grant. In the event we elect to treat the Award as a loan, we will be obligated to repay i) 60%, ii) 80%, iii) 100% or iv) 100% plus interest at 7% plus LIBOR, of the total Award to CIRM, where such repayment rate is dependent upon the phase of clinical development of FT516 at the time of our election. If we do not elect to treat the Award as a loan within 10 years of the date of the Award, the Award will be considered a grant and we will be obligated to pay to CIRM a royalty on commercial sales of FT516 until such royalty payments equal nine times the total amount awarded to us under the Award.\nPrivate Placements of Common and Convertible Preferred Stock\nIn November 2016, we completed a private placement of stock in which investors purchased shares of our Class A convertible Preferred Stock and common stock. We issued 2,819,549 shares of non-voting Class A Preferred Stock at $13.30 per share, each of which is convertible into five shares of common stock upon certain conditions.

Gross proceeds from the private placement were $10.3 million, and after giving effect to costs related to the private placement, net proceeds were $10.2 million.\nSilicon Valley Bank Debt Facility\nOn July 30, 2014, we entered into an Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (Restated LSA) with Silicon Valley Bank (Bank), collateralized by substantially all of our assets, excluding certain intellectual property. The Restated LSA amends and restates the Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of January 5, 2009, as amended, by and between us and the Bank (Loan Agreement). Pursuant to the Restated LSA, the Bank agreed to make loans to us in an aggregate principal amount of up to $20.0 million, comprised of (i) a $10.0 million term loan, funded at the closing date (Term A Loan) and (ii) subject to the achievement of a specified clinical milestone, additional term loans totaling up to $10.0 million in the aggregate, which were available until December 31, 2014 (each, Term B Loan). On December 24, 2014, we elected to draw $10.0 million under the Term B Loan.\nOn July 14, 2017, the Company and the Bank entered into an amendment (SVB Loan Amendment) of the Restated LSA where the Bank extended an additional term loan to the Company in the principal amount of $15.0 million (2017 Term Loan), a portion of which was applied to repay in full all amounts previously outstanding under the Restated LSA. Following such repayment in full of the Company's existing outstanding debt with the Bank under the Restated LSA, cash proceeds to the Company from the remaining portion of the Term Loan were $7.5 million.\nThe 2017 Term Loan matures on January 1, 2022 (Term Loan Maturity Date). The 2017 Term Loan bears interest at a floating per annum rate equal to the greater of (i) 3.50% above the Prime Rate (as defined in the SVB Loan Amendment) or (ii) 7.25%; provided, however, that in no event shall such interest rate exceed 8.25%. Interest is payable on a monthly basis on the first day of each month. From August 1, 2017 through January 1, 2019 (Interest-only Period), the Company was required to make monthly payments of interest only. In January 2019, after achievement of a product development milestone, the Company elected to extend the Interest-only Period from January 1, 2019 through and including to July 1, 2019. The Company is required to repay the principal, plus monthly payments of accrued interest, in 30 equal monthly installments based on a 30-month amortization schedule. The Company's final payment, due on the Term Loan Maturity Date, shall include all outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest under the 2017 Term Loan, plus a 7.5% final payment fee.\nSubject to certain conditions, including the payment of a prepayment fee in the amount 1% of the principal amount of the Term Loan for any prepayment made before July 14, 2019, the Company may voluntarily prepay all, but not less than all, of the 2017 Term Loan.\nIn connection with the SVB Loan Amendment, the Company issued to the Bank on the First Amendment Effective Date a warrant to purchase up to an aggregate of 91,463 shares of the Company's common stock, subject to adjustment, at an exercise price equal to $3.28 per share. All such warrants have been exercised as of December 31, 2018.\nWe are required under the Loan Agreement, as amended by the SVB Loan Amendment, to maintain our deposit and securities accounts with the Bank and to comply with various default clauses and operating covenants that may restrict our ability to finance our operations, engage in business activities or expand or fully pursue our business strategies. A breach of any of these covenants or clauses could result in a default under the Loan Agreement, which could cause all of the outstanding indebtedness under the facility to become immediately due and payable.\nAgreement with Juno Therapeutics, Inc.\nPursuant to the terms of our Agreement with Juno, Juno purchased one million shares of our common stock, at $8.00 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $8.0 million in May 2015, $4.6 million of which was considered an equity component of the transaction.\nRegistration Statements on Form S-3\nIn November 2018, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement (File No. 333-228513), which became effective upon filing. The shelf registration statement allows us to issue certain securities, including shares of our common stock, from time to time. The specific terms of any offering, if any, under the automatic shelf registration statement would be established at the time of such offering. Additionally, we entered into a sales agreement with Leerink Partners LLC (Leerink) with respect to an at-the-market offering program, under which we may offer and sell, from time to time at our sole discretion, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $50.0 million through Leerink as its sales agent.\nIn May 2018, the SEC declared effective a shelf registration statement filed by us in May 2018 (File No. 333-224680). The shelf registration statement allows us to issue certain securities, including shares of our common stock, from time to time. The specific terms of any offering, if any, under the shelf registration statement would be established at the time of such offering. As of December 31, 2018, after giving effect to our September 2018 public offering, we are eligible to issue an aggregate of $6.2 million in securities under this shelf registration statement.\nIn August 2017, the SEC declared effective a shelf registration statement filed by us in August 2017 (File No. 333-219987). The shelf registration statement allows us to issue certain securities, including shares of our common stock, from time to time. The specific terms of any offering, if any, under the shelf registration statement would be established at the time of such offering. As of December 31, 2018, after giving effect to our December 2017 public offering, we are eligible to issue an aggregate of $54.0 million in securities under the shelf registration statement. In addition, this registration statement registered for resale one million shares of common stock held by Juno, which were issued in May 2015 as described below.\nOperating Capital Requirements\nWe anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect the losses to increase as we continue the research and development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates and conduct additional research and development activities pursuant to our collaboration agreements with Juno and Ono. Our product candidates have not yet achieved regulatory approval, and we may not be successful in achieving commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2018 will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements for at least the next twelve months. However, we are subject to all the risks and uncertainties incident in the research and development of therapeutic products. For example, the FDA or other regulatory authorities may require us to generate additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies or clinical trials, or may impose other requirements beyond those that we currently anticipate. Additionally, it is possible for a product candidate to show promising results in preclinical studies or in clinical trials, but fail to establish sufficient safety and efficacy data necessary to obtain regulatory approvals. As a result of these and other risks and uncertainties and the probability of success, the duration and the cost of our research and development activities required to advance a product candidate cannot be accurately estimated and are subject to considerable variation. We may encounter difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors and unforeseen expenses in the course of our research and development activities, any of which may significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely affect our liquidity.\nWe will require additional capital for the research and development of our product candidates and to perform our research and development obligations under our collaboration agreements with Juno and Ono, and we may be forced to seek additional funds sooner than expected to pursue our research and development activities. We expect to finance our capital requirements in the foreseeable future through the sale of public or private equity or debt securities. However, additional capital may not be available to us on reasonable terms, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the research or development of one or more of our product candidates. If we do raise additional funds through the issuance of additional equity or debt securities, it could result in dilution to our existing stockholders, increased fixed payment obligations and the existence of securities with rights that may be senior to those of our common stock. Additionally, if we incur indebtedness, we may become subject to financial or other covenants that could adversely restrict, impair or affect our ability to conduct our business, such as requiring us to relinquish rights to certain of our product candidates or technologies or limiting our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights or incur additional debt. Any of these events could significantly harm our business, operations, financial condition and prospects.\nOur forecast of the period of time through which our existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement and involves significant risks and uncertainties. We have based this forecast on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and actual results could vary materially from our expectations, which may adversely affect our capital resources and liquidity. We could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. The amount and timing of future funding requirements, both near- and long-term, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\nTable 240: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the initiation, timing, progress, size, duration, costs and results of our clinical trials and preclinical studies for our product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 241: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the number and the nature of product candidates that we pursue;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 242: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the cost of manufacturing and process development of our product candidates, including the cost of supplies and materials to support these activities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 243: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the time, cost and outcome of seeking and obtaining regulatory approvals;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 244: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the extent to which we are required to pay milestone or other payments under our in-license agreements and the timing of such payments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 245: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the extent to which milestones are achieved under our collaboration agreements with Juno and Ono, and the time to achievement of such milestones and our receipt of any associated milestone payments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 246: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 247: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the expansion of our research and development activities, including our need and ability to hire additional employees and procure additional equipment, materials and supplies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 248: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the establishment and continuation of collaborations and strategic alliances;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 249: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the timing and terms of future in-licensing and out-licensing transactions; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 250: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the cost of establishing sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution capabilities for, and the pricing and reimbursement of, any products for which we may receive regulatory approval.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIf we cannot continue or expand our research and development operations, or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, because we lack sufficient capital, our business, operations, financial condition and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2018 that are expected to affect our liquidity and cash flows in future periods:\nTable 251: <table> <tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years 1 - 3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years 3 - 5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt (including interest and fees)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,480\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,131\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 59,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur long-term debt bears interest at a floating per annum rate equal to the greater of (i) 3.50% above the Prime Rate (as defined in the SVB Loan Amendment) or (ii) 7.25%; provided, however, that in no event shall such interest rate exceed 8.25%. The amounts in the table above assume payment at our current interest rate of 8.25%, which is subject to change. The amounts in the above table also reflect the actual Interest-only Period through July 31, 2019.\nWe lease certain office and laboratory space under a non-cancelable operating lease. In May 2018, we amended the operating lease, extending the term of the lease through approximately 2028 and agreeing to lease additional space comprising approximately 24,000 square feet in the same building as our existing space for a total occupancy of approximately 72,000 square feet under the lease. In addition to rent, the lease is subject to certain fixed amenities fees. The above table includes all such fixed fees. The lease is subject to additional variable charges for common area maintenance and other costs. We maintain the right to terminate the lease after October 2025, subject to our delivery to the landlord of twelve months' prior written notice and an early termination payment of $2.5 million. See Note 6 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\nWe have no material contractual obligations not fully recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets or fully disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.\nWe have obligations under various license agreements to make future payments to third parties that become due and payable on the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones (such as the start of a clinical trial, filing for product approval with the FDA or other regulatory agencies, product approval by the FDA or other regulatory agencies, product launch or product sales) or on the sublicense of our rights to another party. We have not included these commitments on our balance sheet or in the table above because the achievement and timing of these events is not fixed and determinable. Certain milestones are in advance of receipt of revenue from the sale of products and, therefore, we may require additional debt or equity capital to make such payments.

These contracts generally provide for termination on notice, and therefore are cancelable contracts and not included in the table of contractual obligations and commitments.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have, during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under the caption Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of programmed cellular immunotherapies for cancer and immune disorders. We are developing first-in-class cell therapy product candidates based on a simple notion: we believe that better cell therapies start with better cells.\nTo create better cell therapies, we use a therapeutic approach that we generally refer to as cell programming. For certain of our product candidates, we use pharmacologic modulators, such as small molecules, to enhance the biological properties and therapeutic function of healthy donor cells ex vivo before our product candidates are administered to a patient. In other cases, we use human iPSCs to generate a clonal master iPSC line having preferred biological properties, and direct the fate of the clonal master iPSC line to create our cell therapy product candidate. Analogous to master cell lines used to manufacture biopharmaceutical drug products such as monoclonal antibodies, we believe clonal master iPSC lines can be used as a renewable source for manufacturing cell therapy products which are well-defined and uniform in composition, can be repeatedly mass produced at significant scale in a cost-effective manner, and can be delivered off-the-shelf to treat many patients. Utilizing these therapeutic approaches, we program cells of the blood and immune system, including natural killer (NK) cells, T cells and CD34+ cells, and are advancing a pipeline of programmed cellular immunotherapies in the therapeutic areas of immuno-oncology and immuno-regulation.\nWe have entered into a research collaboration and license agreement with the Regents of the University of Minnesota to develop off-the-shelf NK cell cancer immunotherapies derived from clonal master iPSC lines. Additionally, we have entered into a research collaboration and license agreement with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (Memorial Sloan Kettering) to develop off-the-shelf, engineered T-cell cancer immunotherapies derived from clonal master iPSC lines.\nWe have entered into a collaboration and option agreement with Ono Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. for the joint development and commercialization of two off-the-shelf iPSC-derived CAR T-cell product candidates.\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in 2007, and are headquartered in San Diego, CA. Since our inception in 2007, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to our cell programming approach and the research and development of our product candidates, the creation, licensing and protection of related intellectual property, and the provision of general and administrative support for these activities. To date, we have funded our operations primarily through the public and private sale of common stock, the private placement of preferred stock and convertible notes, commercial bank debt and revenues from collaboration activities and grants.\nWe have never been profitable and have incurred net losses in each year since inception. Substantially all of our net losses resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We expect to continue to incur operating losses for at least the foreseeable future. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. We expect our expenses will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing and planned activities as we:\n \u2022 conduct our clinical trial of ProTmune under our own Investigational New Drug application; \n \u2022 conduct our clinical trials of FATE-NK100, including under investigator-sponsored clinical trial agreements with the University of Minnesota and under our own IND application; \n \u2022 conduct our clinical trials of FT500 and FT516 under our own IND applications; \n \u2022 conduct GMP manufacture, process development and technology transfer activities for the production of our product candidates, including those undergoing clinical investigation and IND-enabling preclinical development; \n \u2022 source clinical supplies and materials used to manufacture our product candidates; \n \u2022 conduct preclinical research, process development, manufacturing and development activities to support the clinical translation of our first-in-class product candidates derived from master iPSC lines; \n \u2022 conduct clinical trials of our product candidates; \n \u2022 build-out our own GMP manufacturing capabilities; \n \u2022 continue our research and development activities, including under our collaboration agreement with Ono; \n \u2022 maintain, prosecute, protect, expand and enforce our intellectual property portfolio; \n \u2022 engage with regulatory authorities for the development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates; \n \u2022 hire additional clinical, manufacturing, regulatory, quality control and technical personnel to advance our product candidates; \n \u2022 hire additional scientific personnel to advance our research and development efforts; and \n \u2022 hire general and administrative personnel to continue operating as a public company and support our operations. \nWe do not expect to generate any revenues from sales of any therapeutic products unless and until we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval for one or more of our product candidates, which we expect will take a number of years. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. Accordingly, we will seek to fund our operations through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements when needed would have a negative effect on our financial condition and ability to develop our product candidates.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nWe conduct substantially all of our activities through Fate Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation, at our facilities in San Diego, California. Fate Therapeutics, Inc. owns 100% of the voting shares of Fate Therapeutics Ltd. (Fate Ltd.), incorporated in the United Kingdom, whose operations have not been material to date. Effective May 2018, Fate Therapeutics, Inc. owns 100% of the voting shares of Tfinity Therapeutics, Inc. (Tfinity) and previously owned the majority of the voting shares of Tfinity and controlled Tfinity for consolidation purposes. To date, Tfinity has not had any material operations. The following information is presented on a consolidated basis to include the accounts of Fate Therapeutics, Inc., Tfinity, and Fate Ltd. All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation.\nIn February 2019, Fate Therapeutics B.V. (Fate B.V.), a wholly owned subsidiary of Fate Therapeutics, Inc. was incorporated in the Netherlands. The operations have Fate B.V. have not been material to date.\nCollaboration Revenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenues from therapeutic product sales. Our revenues have been derived from collaboration agreements and government grants.\nAgreement with Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.\nOn September 14, 2018, we entered into a Collaboration and Option Agreement (the Ono Agreement) with Ono Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (Ono) for the joint development and commercialization of two off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived CAR T-cell product candidates. Pursuant to the terms of the Ono Agreement, we received an upfront, non-refundable and non-creditable payment of $10.0 million. Additionally, we are entitled to receive fees for the conduct of research and preclinical development under a joint development plan, which fees are estimated to be $20.0 million in aggregate (of which $5.0 million was received in October 2018).\nWe concluded that Ono represented a customer and in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, we determined that the initial transaction price under the Ono Agreement equals $30.0 million, consisting of the upfront, non-refundable and non-creditable payment of $10.0 million and the aggregate estimated research and development fees of $20.0 million. In addition, we identified our performance obligations under the Ono Agreement, including our grant of a license to Ono to certain of our intellectual property subject to certain conditions, our conduct of research services, and our participation in a joint steering committee. We determined that all performance obligations should be accounted for as one combined performance obligation since no individual performance obligation is distinct, and that the combined performance obligation is transferred over the expected term of the conduct of the research services, which is estimated to be four years.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized $0.6 million of collaboration revenue under the Ono Agreement. As of December 31, 2018, aggregate deferred revenue related to the Ono Agreement was $14.4 million.\nAgreement with Juno Therapeutics, Inc.\nOn May 4, 2015, we entered into a strategic research collaboration and license agreement (the Juno Agreement) with Juno Therapeutics, Inc. (Juno) to screen for and identify small molecule modulators that enhance the therapeutic properties of Juno's genetically-engineered T-cell immunotherapies. Pursuant to the terms of the Juno Agreement, we received an upfront, non-refundable and non-creditable payment of $5.0 million and Juno purchased 1,000,000 shares of our common stock at $8.00 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $8.0 million. Additionally, we have received, and are entitled to receive, minimum annual research payments of $2.0 million for the conduct of research services during the initial four-year term of the Juno Agreement.\nWe determined that the common stock purchase by Juno represented a premium of $3.40 per share, or $3.4 million in aggregate (Equity Premium), and the remaining $4.6 million was recorded as issuance of common stock in shareholders' equity.\nIn accordance with ASC 606, we determined that the transaction price under the Juno Agreement equals $16.4 million, consisting of the upfront, non-refundable and non-creditable payment of $5.0 million, the $3.4 million Equity Premium and $8.0 million of estimated payments for the conduct of research services during the initial four-year term. In addition, we identified our performance obligations under the Juno Agreement, including our grant of an exclusive worldwide license to certain of our intellectual property subject to certain conditions, our conduct of research services and our participation in a joint research committee. We determined that all performance obligations should be accounted for as one combined performance obligation since no individual performance obligation is distinct, and that the combined performance obligation is transferred ratably over the expected term of conduct of the research services, which is four years.\nIn connection with the Juno Agreement, we have recognized $4.1 million and $4.1 million, respectively, during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, as collaboration revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. As of December 31, 2018, aggregate deferred revenue related to the Juno Agreement was $0.7 million.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist of costs associated with the research, preclinical development, manufacture and clinical development of our product candidates, the research and development of our cell programming technology including our iPSC product platform, and the performance of research and development activities under our collaboration agreements. These costs are expensed as incurred and include:\n \u2022 salaries and employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation; \n \u2022 costs incurred under clinical trial agreements with investigative sites; \n \u2022 costs to acquire, develop and manufacture preclinical study and clinical trial materials, including our product candidates; \n \u2022 costs associated with conducting our preclinical, process development, manufacturing, clinical and regulatory activities, including fees paid to third-party professional consultants, service providers and suppliers; \n \u2022 costs incurred under our collaboration agreements; \n \u2022 costs for research, laboratory and manufacturing materials and supplies; \n \u2022 costs incurred to license and maintain intellectual property; and \n \u2022 facilities, depreciation and other expenses including allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities. \nWe plan to increase our current level of research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue the clinical and preclinical development of our product candidates, research and develop our cell programming technology including our iPSC product platform, and perform our obligations under collaboration agreements including under our agreements with Ono, University of Minnesota and Memorial Sloan Kettering. Our current planned research and development activities over the next twelve months consist primarily of the following:\n \u2022 conducting clinical trials of our product candidates; \n \u2022 conducting GMP manufacture, process development and technology transfer activities for the production of our product candidates, including those undergoing clinical investigation and IND-enabling preclinical development; \n \u2022 source clinical supplies and materials used to manufacture our product candidates; \n \u2022 conducting preclinical research, process development, manufacturing and clinical translation activities to investigate the therapeutic potential of our immuno-oncology product candidates, and initiating and conducting first-in-human clinical trials of such product candidates; \n \u2022 conducting preclinical research and process development activities to investigate the therapeutic potential of our immuno-regulatory product candidates; and \n \u2022 performing research, preclinical development, process development, manufacturing and clinical translation activities under our sponsored research and collaboration agreements, including our agreements with Ono, University of Minnesota and Memorial Sloan Kettering. \nDue to the inherently unpredictable nature of preclinical and clinical development, and given our novel therapeutic approach and the current stage of development of our product candidates, we cannot determine and are unable to estimate with certainty the timelines we will require and the costs we will incur for the development of our product candidates, including ProTmune, FATE-NK100, FT500, FT516 and our other product candidates derived from clonal master iPSC lines. Clinical and preclinical development timelines and costs, and the potential of development success, can differ materially from expectations. In addition, we cannot forecast which product candidates may be subject to future collaborations, when such arrangements will be secured, if at all, and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation, for our employees in executive, operational, finance and human resource functions; professional fees for accounting, legal and tax services; costs for obtaining, prosecuting and maintaining our intellectual property; and other costs and fees, including director and officer insurance premiums, to support our operations as a public company. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our research and development activities, maintain compliance with exchange listing and SEC requirements and continue to operate as a public company.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther income (expense) consists primarily of interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents, interest income from short-term investments (including the amortization of discounts and premiums), and interest expense.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to accrued expenses and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report, we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant procedures, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update 2014-09 (ASU 2014-09), Topic 606, which created a single, principle-based revenue recognition model that supersedes and replaces nearly all existing U.S. GAAP revenue recognition guidance. We adopted ASU 2014-09 in the first quarter of 2018 using the full retrospective method. We evaluated the effect that the updated standard had on our internal processes, financial statements and related disclosures, and we determined that the adoption did not have a material impact on our historical consolidated financial statements.\nWe recognize revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of control of a product or a service to a customer and reflects the amount of the consideration we are entitled to receive in exchange for such product or service. In doing so, we follow a five-step approach: (i) identify the contract with a customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the customer obtains control of the product or service. We consider the terms of a contract and all relevant facts and circumstances when applying the revenue recognition standard. We apply the revenue recognition standard, including the use of any practical expedients, consistently to contracts with similar characteristics and in similar circumstances.\nA customer is a party that has entered into a contract with us, where the purpose of the contract is to obtain a product or a service that is an output of our ordinary activities in exchange for consideration. To be considered a contract, (i) the contract must be approved (in writing, orally, or in accordance with other customary business practices), (ii) each party's rights regarding the product or the service to be transferred can be identified, (iii) the payment terms for the product or the service to be transferred can be identified, (iv) the contract must have commercial substance (that is, the risk, timing or amount of future cash flows is expected to change as a result of the contract), and (v) it is probable that we will collect substantially all of the consideration to which we are entitled to receive in exchange for the transfer of the product or the service.\nA performance obligation is defined as a promise to transfer a product or a service to a customer. We identify each promise to transfer a product or a service (or a bundle of products or services, or a series of products and services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer) that is distinct. A product or a service is distinct if both (i) the customer can benefit from the product or the service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer and (ii) our promise to transfer the product or the service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. Each distinct promise to transfer a product or a service is a unit of accounting for revenue recognition. If a promise to transfer a product or a service is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contract, such promises should be combined into a single performance obligation.\nThe transaction price is the amount of consideration we are entitled to receive in exchange for the transfer of control of a product or a service to a customer. To determine the transaction price, we consider the existence of any significant financing component, the effects of any variable elements, noncash considerations and consideration payable to the customer. If a significant financing component exists, the transaction price is adjusted for the time value of money. If an element of variability exists, we must estimate the consideration we expect to receive and use that amount as the basis for recognizing revenue as the product or the service is transferred to the customer. There are two methods for determining the amount of variable consideration: (i) the expected value method, which is the sum of probability-weighted amounts in a range of possible consideration amounts, and (ii) the mostly likely amount method, which identifies the single most likely amount in a range of possible consideration amounts.\nIf a contract has multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in an amount that reflects the consideration we are entitled to receive in exchange for satisfying each distinct performance obligation. For each distinct performance obligation, revenue is recognized when (or as) we transfer control of the product or the service applicable to such performance obligation. To date, for collaboration arrangements that represent a single performance obligation, the revenues are recognized over time based on costs incurred compared to total estimated costs.\nIn those instances where we first receive consideration in advance of satisfying its performance obligation, we classify such consideration as deferred revenue until (or as) we satisfy such performance obligation. In those instances where we first satisfy our performance obligation prior to our receipt of consideration, the consideration is recorded as accounts receivable.\nWe expense incremental costs of obtaining a contract as and when incurred if the expected amortization period of the asset that would be recognized is one year or less, or if the amount of the asset is immaterial.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. Examples of accrued research and development expenses include amounts owed to clinical research organizations, to investigative sites in connection with clinical trials, to sponsored research organizations, to service providers in connection with preclinical development activities and to service providers related to product manufacturing, development and distribution of clinical supplies.\nWe base our accrued expenses related to clinical trials on our estimates of the services performed and efforts expended pursuant to our contractual arrangements, including those with clinical research organizations. The financial terms of these agreements are sometimes subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our service providers will exceed the level of services performed and result in a prepayment of the clinical expense. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical milestones. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid accordingly.\nAlthough we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from expenses actually incurred, if our estimates of the status and timing of services performed differs from the actual status and timing of services performed, we may report amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have been no material differences from our estimates to the amounts actually incurred.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense represents the grant date fair value of employee stock option and restricted stock unit grants recognized over the requisite service period of the awards (usually the vesting period) on a straight-line basis. For stock option grants with performance-based milestones, the expense is recorded over the remaining service period after the point when the achievement of the milestone is probable or the performance condition has been achieved. For stock option grants with both performance-based milestones and market conditions, expense is recorded over the derived service period after the point when the achievement of the performance-based milestone is probable or the performance condition has been achieved. We estimate the fair value of stock option grants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, with the exception of option grants with both performance-based milestones and market conditions, which are valued using a lattice based model. The fair value of restricted stock units is based on the closing price of our common stock as reported on The NASDAQ Global Market on the date of grant.\nWe account for stock options and restricted stock awards to non-employees using the fair value approach. Stock options and restricted stock awards to non-employees are subject to periodic revaluation over their vesting terms. For stock option grants with performance-based milestones, the expense is recorded over the remaining service period after the point when the performance condition is determined to be probable of achievement or when it has been achieved.\nWe generally estimate the fair value of our stock option awards to employees and non-employees using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including (a) the risk-free interest rate, (b) the expected volatility of our stock, (c) the expected term of the award and (d) the expected dividend yield. Due to the lack of an adequate history of a public market for the trading of our common stock and a lack of adequate company specific historical and implied volatility data, we have based our estimate of expected volatility on the historical volatility of a group of similar companies that are publicly traded. For these analyses, we have selected companies with comparable characteristics to ours including enterprise value, risk profiles, position within the industry, and with historical share price information sufficient to meet the expected life of the stock-based awards. We compute the historical volatility data using the daily closing prices for the selected companies' shares during the equivalent period of the calculated expected term of our stock-based awards. We will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available. We have estimated the expected life of our employee stock options using the simplified\u201d method, whereby, the expected life equals the average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option. The risk-free interest rates for periods within the expected life of the option are based on the yields of zero-coupon U.S. Treasury securities. See Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nTotal stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, was $6.3 million, $3.6 million, and $3.2 million, respectively. Expense related to unvested employee stock option grants not yet recognized as of December 31, 2018 was approximately $15.9 million and the weighted-average period over which these grants are expected to vest is 3.1 years. As of December 31, 2018, the unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding restricted stock units was $0.4 million, which is expected to be recognized as expense over approximately 0.8 years.\nOther Company Information\nJOBS Act\nOn April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act), was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company\u201d can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. As of December 31, 2018, we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company.\nSubject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, as we are no longer an emerging growth company,\u201d we are subject to certain additional requirements, including without limitation, (i) providing an auditor's attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) complying with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements, known as the auditor discussion and analysis.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements, please see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nThe following table summarizes the results of our operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 223: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase/\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Collaboration revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,740\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 56,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,935\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other (income) expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (494\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,321\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue.

As of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $285.4 million and anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of the net cash flow activity for each of the years ended December 31:\nTable 239: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (38,650\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (36,817\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (29,823\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (463\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10,196\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,114\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 140,780\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 47,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 57,737\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 101,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nCash used in operating activities increased from $36.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $38.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The primary driver of this change in cash used in operating activities was our increase in net loss from 2017 to 2018, partially offset by an increase of $14.4 million in deferred revenue resulting primarily from entering into our collaboration agreement with Ono and a one-time, non-cash expense of $6.1 million incurred from the issuance of common stock to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Gladstone in connection with those license agreements.\nCash used in operating activities increased from $29.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $36.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The primary driver of this change in cash used in operating activities was our increase in net loss from 2016 to 2017, partially offset by an increase of $1.0 million in deferred rent resulting from the office and lab expansion in January 2017 and an increase of $1.0 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses.\nAgreement with Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.\nOn September 14, 2018, we entered into the Ono Agreement with Ono for the joint development and commercialization of two off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived CAR T-cell product candidates (each a Candidate and collectively the Candidates). Under the terms of the Ono Agreement, Ono paid to us an upfront, non-refundable and non-creditable payment of $10.0 million. Additionally, as consideration for our conduct of research and preclinical development under a joint development plan, Ono pays us annual research and development fees set forth in the annual budget included in the joint development plan, which fees are estimated to be $20.0 million in aggregate over the course of the joint development plan. Further, under the terms of the Ono Agreement, Ono has agreed to pay us up to an additional $40.0 million, subject to the achievement of a preclinical milestone and the exercise by Ono of its options to obtain exclusive licenses to develop and commercialize the Candidates. Such fees are in addition to the upfront payment and research and development fees.\nSubject to Ono's exercise of its options to obtain exclusive licenses to develop and commercialize the Candidates and to the achievement of certain clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones with respect to each Candidate in specified territories, we are entitled to receive an aggregate of up to $285.0 million in milestone payments for Candidate 1 and an aggregate of up to $895.0 million in milestone payments for Candidate 2, with the applicable milestone payments for Candidate 2 for the United States and Europe subject to reduction by 50% if we elect to co-develop and co-commercialize Candidate 2 as described above. As of December 31, 2018, we have not received any such milestone payments. We are also eligible to receive tiered royalties ranging from the mid-single digits to the low-double digits based on annual net sales by Ono of each Candidate in specified territories, with such royalties subject to certain reductions. As of December 31, 2018, no royalties have been paid to us.\nAs a direct result of our entry into the Ono Agreement, we incurred an aggregate of $2.0 million in sublicense consideration to existing licensors of ours. The $2.0 million sublicense consideration represents an asset under ASC 340, Other Assets and Deferred Costs. As of December 31, 2018, $1.0 million of such consideration has been paid, while the remaining $1.0 million remains in account payable.\nAgreement with Juno Therapeutics, Inc.\nOn May 4, 2015, we entered into a strategic research collaboration and license agreement with Juno to screen for and identify small molecule modulators that enhance the therapeutic properties of Juno's genetically-engineered T-cell immunotherapies. Pursuant to the terms of the Juno Agreement, Juno paid us an upfront, non-refundable and non-creditable payment of $5.0 million, and purchased one million shares of our common stock, at $8.00 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $8.0 million. Additionally, Juno agreed to fund all of our collaboration research activities for an initial four-year research term beginning on the effective date of the Juno Agreement, with minimum annual research payments of $2.0 million to us. Juno has the option to extend the exclusive research term for an additional two years beyond the initial four-year term, subject to the payment of a one-time, non-refundable extension fee of $3.0 million and the continued funding of our activities under the collaboration during the extended term, with minimum annual research payments of $4.0 million to us during the two-year extension period. As of December 31, 2018, we have received a total of $6.8 million of such research payments. We received a $0.5 million research payment during January 2019.\nWe are eligible under the Juno Agreement to receive selection fees for each tumor-associated antigen target selected by Juno and bonus selection fees based on the aggregate number of tumor-associated antigen targets selected by Juno. Additionally, in connection with each Juno therapy that uses or incorporates our small molecule modulators, Juno has agreed to pay us non-refundable, non-creditable milestone payments totaling up to approximately $51.0 million, in the aggregate, per therapy upon the achievement of various clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones. Additionally, in connection with the third Juno therapy and the fifth Juno therapy that uses or incorporates our small molecule modulators, Juno has agreed to pay us additional non-refundable, non-creditable bonus milestone payments totaling up to approximately $116.0 million and $137.5 million, respectively, in the aggregate, per therapy upon the achievement of various clinical, regulatory, and commercial milestones. As of December 31, 2018, we have not received any selection fees or milestone payments.\nBeginning on the date of the first commercial sale (in each country) for each Juno therapy that uses or incorporates our small molecule modulators, and continuing until the later of i) the expiration of the last valid patent claim, ii) ten years after such first commercial sale, or iii) the expiration of all data and other regulatory exclusivity periods afforded each therapy, Juno has agreed to pay us royalties in the low single-digits on net sales of each Juno therapy that uses or incorporates our small molecule modulators. As of December 31, 2018, no royalties have been paid to us.\nIn March 2018, Juno was acquired by Celgene Corporation (Celgene). This acquisition did not affect the terms of our agreement with Juno Agreement. On January 3, 2019, Celgene announced that it had entered into a definitive merger agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS), under which BMS will acquire Celgene.\nMemorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center License Agreement\nOn May 15, 2018, we entered into an Amended and Restated Exclusive License Agreement with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK). The agreement amends and restates the license agreement entered into between us and MSK on August 19, 2016. In consideration for the additional rights granted under the May 2018 agreement, we issued 500,000 shares of our common stock to MSK, which shares were valued at $4.8 million on the date of agreement. We also paid an upfront cash fee of $0.5 million, and we are obligated to pay milestone payments upon the achievement of specified clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones and royalty payments to MSK on net sales of licensed products. We are also obligated to pay MSK a percentage of certain sublicense income received by us. Furthermore, in the event a licensed product achieves a specified clinical milestone, MSK is then eligible to receive additional milestone payments, where the amount of such payments owed to MSK are contingent upon certain increases in the price of the Company's common stock following the date of achievement of such clinical milestone.\nJ. David Gladstone Institutes License Agreement\nOn September 11, 2018, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with the J. David Gladstone Institutes (Gladstone). Pursuant to the Gladstone license agreement, we issued 100,000 shares of our common stock to Gladstone, which shares were valued at $1.3 million on the date of the agreement. We also paid an upfront cash fee of $0.1 million, and we are obligated to pay milestone payments in an aggregate amount of up to approximately $1.9 million upon the achievement of specified clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones and as well as royalties to Gladstone in the low single digits on net sales of licensed products. We are also obligated to pay Gladstone a tiered percentage in the low to mid-single digits of certain sublicense income received by us.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, investing activities used cash of $0.5 million, $10.2 million and $4.1 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2018 we purchased $55.7 million in U.S. Treasuries as short-term investments, offset by $57.5 million in maturities of these short-term investments. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we purchased $40.0 million in U.S. Treasuries as short-term investments, offset by $31.5 million in maturities of these short-term investments. The remaining investing activities for the periods presented were primarily attributable to the purchase of property and equipment.\nFinancing Activities\nFinancing activities provided cash of $140.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which primarily consisted of the $134.9 million of net proceeds from our September 2018 public offering of common stock and $3.5 million of proceeds from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) award.\nFinancing activities provided cash of $47.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which primarily consisted of $43.2 million of net proceeds from our December 2017 public offering of common stock and $15.0 million of proceeds from the July 14, 2017 amendment to our loan agreement with Silicon Valley Bank, offset by $10.8 million of principal payments on our term loans outstanding with Silicon Valley Bank.\nFinancing activities provided cash of $57.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which primarily consisted of $36.4 million of net proceeds from our November 2016 private placement issuance of Class A convertible preferred stock, $18.6 million of net proceeds from our November 2016 private placement issuance of common stock and $10.2 million of net proceeds from our August 2016 private placement issuance of common stock, offset by $7.7 million of principal payments on our term loans outstanding with Silicon Valley Bank.\nFrom our inception through December 31, 2018 we have funded our consolidated operations primarily through the public and private sale of common stock, the private placement of preferred stock and convertible notes, commercial bank debt and revenues from collaboration activities and grants. As of December 31, 2018, we had aggregate cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $201.0 million.\nPublic Offering of Common Stock\nIn September 2018, we completed a public offering of common stock in which investors, certain of which are affiliated with our directors, purchased 10,648,149 shares of our common stock at a price of $13.50 per share under our shelf registration statement. Gross proceeds from the offering were $143.8 million. After giving effect to $8.9 million in underwriting discounts, commissions and expenses related to the offering, net proceeds were $134.9 million.\nIn December 2017, we completed a public offering of common stock in which investors purchased 10,953,750 shares of our common stock at a price of $4.20 per share under a shelf registration statement. Gross proceeds from the offering were $46.0 million. After giving effect to an estimated $3.0 million of costs related to the offering (of which $0.3 million was paid during 2018), net proceeds were $43.0 million.\nCalifornia Institute for Regenerative Medicine Award\nOn April 5, 2018, we executed an award agreement with CIRM pursuant to which CIRM awarded us up to $4.0 million to advance our FT516 product candidate into a first-in-human clinical trial for the treatment of subjects with advanced solid tumors, including in combination with monoclonal antibody therapy (the Award). Pursuant to the terms of the Award, we are eligible to receive five disbursements in varying amounts totaling $4.0 million throughout the project period of the Award, which was estimated to be from April 1, 2018 to June 30, 2019 (the Project Period). In December 2018, we discussed with CIRM our intent to pursue the clinical development of FT516 in relapsed / refractory hematologic malignancies in addition to advanced solid tumors, and our preference to first submit an IND application for FT516 in relapsed / refractory hematologic malignancies rather than in advanced solid tumors. In January 2019, we submitted our IND application for FT516 in relapsed / refractory hematologic malignancies, which IND submission was allowed by the FDA in February 2019. We agreed with CIRM to suspend the Award until such time as we elect to proceed with our submission of an IND application for FT516 in advanced solid tumors. At the time of suspension, an additional $0.5 million was available for funding under the Award.\nThe Award is subject to certain co-funding requirements by us. Following the conclusion of the Project Period, we, in our sole discretion, have the option to treat the Award either as a loan or as a grant. In the event we elect to treat the Award as a loan, we will be obligated to repay i) 60%, ii) 80%, iii) 100% or iv) 100% plus interest at 7% plus LIBOR, of the total Award to CIRM, where such repayment rate is dependent upon the phase of clinical development of FT516 at the time of our election. If we do not elect to treat the Award as a loan within 10 years of the date of the Award, the Award will be considered a grant and we will be obligated to pay to CIRM a royalty on commercial sales of FT516 until such royalty payments equal nine times the total amount awarded to us under the Award.\nPrivate Placements of Common and Convertible Preferred Stock\nIn November 2016, we completed a private placement of stock in which investors purchased shares of our Class A convertible Preferred Stock and common stock. We issued 2,819,549 shares of non-voting Class A Preferred Stock at $13.30 per share, each of which is convertible into five shares of common stock upon certain conditions. We also issued 7,236,837 shares of common stock at $2.66 per share. Gross proceeds from the private placement were $56.7 million. After giving effect to costs related to the private placement, net proceeds were $54.9 million.\nIn August 2016, we completed a private placement of common stock in which investors purchased 5,250,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $1.96 per share. Gross proceeds from the private placement were $10.3 million, and after giving effect to costs related to the private placement, net proceeds were $10.2 million.\nSilicon Valley Bank Debt Facility\nOn July 30, 2014, we entered into an Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (Restated LSA) with Silicon Valley Bank (Bank), collateralized by substantially all of our assets, excluding certain intellectual property. The Restated LSA amends and restates the Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of January 5, 2009, as amended, by and between us and the Bank (Loan Agreement). Pursuant to the Restated LSA, the Bank agreed to make loans to us in an aggregate principal amount of up to $20.0 million, comprised of (i) a $10.0 million term loan, funded at the closing date (Term A Loan) and (ii) subject to the achievement of a specified clinical milestone, additional term loans totaling up to $10.0 million in the aggregate, which were available until December 31, 2014 (each, Term B Loan). On December 24, 2014, we elected to draw $10.0 million under the Term B Loan.\nOn July 14, 2017, the Company and the Bank entered into an amendment (SVB Loan Amendment) of the Restated LSA where the Bank extended an additional term loan to the Company in the principal amount of $15.0 million (2017 Term Loan), a portion of which was applied to repay in full all amounts previously outstanding under the Restated LSA. Following such repayment in full of the Company's existing outstanding debt with the Bank under the Restated LSA, cash proceeds to the Company from the remaining portion of the Term Loan were $7.5 million.\nThe 2017 Term Loan matures on January 1, 2022 (Term Loan Maturity Date). The 2017 Term Loan bears interest at a floating per annum rate equal to the greater of (i) 3.50% above the Prime Rate (as defined in the SVB Loan Amendment) or (ii) 7.25%; provided, however, that in no event shall such interest rate exceed 8.25%. Interest is payable on a monthly basis on the first day of each month. From August 1, 2017 through January 1, 2019 (Interest-only Period), the Company was required to make monthly payments of interest only. In January 2019, after achievement of a product development milestone, the Company elected to extend the Interest-only Period from January 1, 2019 through and including to July 1, 2019. The Company is required to repay the principal, plus monthly payments of accrued interest, in 30 equal monthly installments based on a 30-month amortization schedule. The Company's final payment, due on the Term Loan Maturity Date, shall include all outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest under the 2017 Term Loan, plus a 7.5% final payment fee.\nSubject to certain conditions, including the payment of a prepayment fee in the amount 1% of the principal amount of the Term Loan for any prepayment made before July 14, 2019, the Company may voluntarily prepay all, but not less than all, of the 2017 Term Loan.\nIn connection with the SVB Loan Amendment, the Company issued to the Bank on the First Amendment Effective Date a warrant to purchase up to an aggregate of 91,463 shares of the Company's common stock, subject to adjustment, at an exercise price equal to $3.28 per share. All such warrants have been exercised as of December 31, 2018.\nWe are required under the Loan Agreement, as amended by the SVB Loan Amendment, to maintain our deposit and securities accounts with the Bank and to comply with various default clauses and operating covenants that may restrict our ability to finance our operations, engage in business activities or expand or fully pursue our business strategies. A breach of any of these covenants or clauses could result in a default under the Loan Agreement, which could cause all of the outstanding indebtedness under the facility to become immediately due and payable.\nAgreement with Juno Therapeutics, Inc.\nPursuant to the terms of our Agreement with Juno, Juno purchased one million shares of our common stock, at $8.00 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $8.0 million in May 2015, $4.6 million of which was considered an equity component of the transaction.\nRegistration Statements on Form S-3\nIn November 2018, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement (File No. 333-228513), which became effective upon filing. The shelf registration statement allows us to issue certain securities, including shares of our common stock, from time to time. The specific terms of any offering, if any, under the automatic shelf registration statement would be established at the time of such offering. Additionally, we entered into a sales agreement with Leerink Partners LLC (Leerink) with respect to an at-the-market offering program, under which we may offer and sell, from time to time at our sole discretion, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $50.0 million through Leerink as its sales agent.\nIn May 2018, the SEC declared effective a shelf registration statement filed by us in May 2018 (File No. 333-224680). The shelf registration statement allows us to issue certain securities, including shares of our common stock, from time to time. The specific terms of any offering, if any, under the shelf registration statement would be established at the time of such offering. As of December 31, 2018, after giving effect to our September 2018 public offering, we are eligible to issue an aggregate of $6.2 million in securities under this shelf registration statement.\nIn August 2017, the SEC declared effective a shelf registration statement filed by us in August 2017 (File No. 333-219987). The shelf registration statement allows us to issue certain securities, including shares of our common stock, from time to time. The specific terms of any offering, if any, under the shelf registration statement would be established at the time of such offering. As of December 31, 2018, after giving effect to our December 2017 public offering, we are eligible to issue an aggregate of $54.0 million in securities under the shelf registration statement. In addition, this registration statement registered for resale one million shares of common stock held by Juno, which were issued in May 2015 as described below.\nOperating Capital Requirements\nWe anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect the losses to increase as we continue the research and development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates and conduct additional research and development activities pursuant to our collaboration agreements with Juno and Ono. Our product candidates have not yet achieved regulatory approval, and we may not be successful in achieving commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2018 will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements for at least the next twelve months. However, we are subject to all the risks and uncertainties incident in the research and development of therapeutic products. For example, the FDA or other regulatory authorities may require us to generate additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies or clinical trials, or may impose other requirements beyond those that we currently anticipate. Additionally, it is possible for a product candidate to show promising results in preclinical studies or in clinical trials, but fail to establish sufficient safety and efficacy data necessary to obtain regulatory approvals. As a result of these and other risks and uncertainties and the probability of success, the duration and the cost of our research and development activities required to advance a product candidate cannot be accurately estimated and are subject to considerable variation. We may encounter difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors and unforeseen expenses in the course of our research and development activities, any of which may significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely affect our liquidity.\nWe will require additional capital for the research and development of our product candidates and to perform our research and development obligations under our collaboration agreements with Juno and Ono, and we may be forced to seek additional funds sooner than expected to pursue our research and development activities. We expect to finance our capital requirements in the foreseeable future through the sale of public or private equity or debt securities. However, additional capital may not be available to us on reasonable terms, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the research or development of one or more of our product candidates. If we do raise additional funds through the issuance of additional equity or debt securities, it could result in dilution to our existing stockholders, increased fixed payment obligations and the existence of securities with rights that may be senior to those of our common stock. Additionally, if we incur indebtedness, we may become subject to financial or other covenants that could adversely restrict, impair or affect our ability to conduct our business, such as requiring us to relinquish rights to certain of our product candidates or technologies or limiting our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights or incur additional debt. Any of these events could significantly harm our business, operations, financial condition and prospects.\nOur forecast of the period of time through which our existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement and involves significant risks and uncertainties. We have based this forecast on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and actual results could vary materially from our expectations, which may adversely affect our capital resources and liquidity. We could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. The amount and timing of future funding requirements, both near- and long-term, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n \u2022 the initiation, timing, progress, size, duration, costs and results of our clinical trials and preclinical studies for our product candidates; \n \u2022 the number and the nature of product candidates that we pursue; \n \u2022 the cost of manufacturing and process development of our product candidates, including the cost of supplies and materials to support these activities; \n \u2022 the time, cost and outcome of seeking and obtaining regulatory approvals; \n \u2022 the extent to which we are required to pay milestone or other payments under our in-license agreements and the timing of such payments; \n \u2022 the extent to which milestones are achieved under our collaboration agreements with Juno and Ono, and the time to achievement of such milestones and our receipt of any associated milestone payments; \n \u2022 the cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights; \n \u2022 the expansion of our research and development activities, including our need and ability to hire additional employees and procure additional equipment, materials and supplies; \n \u2022 the establishment and continuation of collaborations and strategic alliances; \n \u2022 the timing and terms of future in-licensing and out-licensing transactions; and \n \u2022 the cost of establishing sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution capabilities for, and the pricing and reimbursement of, any products for which we may receive regulatory approval. \nIf we cannot continue or expand our research and development operations, or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, because we lack sufficient capital, our business, operations, financial condition and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2018 that are expected to affect our liquidity and cash flows in future periods:\nTable 251: <table> <tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years 1 - 3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years 3 - 5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt (including interest and fees)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,480\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,131\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 59,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur long-term debt bears interest at a floating per annum rate equal to the greater of (i) 3.50% above the Prime Rate (as defined in the SVB Loan Amendment) or (ii) 7.25%; provided, however, that in no event shall such interest rate exceed 8.25%. The amounts in the table above assume payment at our current interest rate of 8.25%, which is subject to change. The amounts in the above table also reflect the actual Interest-only Period through July 31, 2019.\nWe lease certain office and laboratory space under a non-cancelable operating lease. In May 2018, we amended the operating lease, extending the term of the lease through approximately 2028 and agreeing to lease additional space comprising approximately 24,000 square feet in the same building as our existing space for a total occupancy of approximately 72,000 square feet under the lease. In addition to rent, the lease is subject to certain fixed amenities fees. The above table includes all such fixed fees. The lease is subject to additional variable charges for common area maintenance and other costs. We maintain the right to terminate the lease after October 2025, subject to our delivery to the landlord of twelve months' prior written notice and an early termination payment of $2.5 million. See Note 6 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\nWe have no material contractual obligations not fully recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets or fully disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.\nWe have obligations under various license agreements to make future payments to third parties that become due and payable on the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones (such as the start of a clinical trial, filing for product approval with the FDA or other regulatory agencies, product approval by the FDA or other regulatory agencies, product launch or product sales) or on the sublicense of our rights to another party. We have not included these commitments on our balance sheet or in the table above because the achievement and timing of these events is not fixed and determinable. Certain milestones are in advance of receipt of revenue from the sale of products and, therefore, we may require additional debt or equity capital to make such payments. These commitments include:\n \u2022 Under a license agreement with Children's Medical Center Corporation pursuant to which we license certain patents relating to our ex vivo cell programming approach and our programmed hematopoietic cell therapies, we are required to make annual maintenance payments and payments based upon development, regulatory and commercial milestones for any products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property. The maximum aggregate milestone payments we may be obligated to make per product are $5.0 million. We will also be required to pay a royalty on net sales of products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property in the low- to mid-single digits. The royalty is subject to reduction for any third-party payments required to be made, with a minimum floor in the low single digits. We have the right to sublicense our rights under this agreement, and we will be required to pay a percentage of any sublicense income. \n \u2022 Under a license agreement with the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, pursuant to which we license certain patents relating to our iPSC product platform, we are required to make annual maintenance payments and payments based upon development, regulatory and commercial milestones for any products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property. The maximum aggregate milestone payments we may be obligated to make per product are $2.3 million. We will also be required to pay a royalty on net sales of products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property in the low single digits. The royalty is subject to reduction for any third-party payments required to be made, with a minimum floor in the low single digits. We have the right to sublicense our rights under this agreement, and we will be required to pay a percentage of any sublicense income. \n \u2022 Under license agreements with The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI), pursuant to which we license certain patents relating to our iPSC product platform, we are required to make annual maintenance payments and payments based upon development, regulatory and commercial milestones for any products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property. The maximum aggregate milestone payments we may be obligated to make are $1.8 million. We will also be required to pay a royalty on net sales of products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property in the low- to mid-single digits. The royalty is subject to reduction for any third-party payments required to be made, with a minimum floor in the low single digits. We have the right to sublicense our rights under these agreements, and we will be required to pay a percentage of any sublicense income. \n \u2022 Under a license agreement with the Regents of the University of Minnesota, pursuant to which we license certain patents relating to compositions and uses of NK cells and to compositions of engineered receptors and immune cells expressing such receptors, we are required to make annual maintenance payments and payments based upon development, regulatory and commercial milestones for any products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property. The maximum aggregate milestone payments we may be obligated to make per product are $4.6 million. We will also be required to pay a royalty on net sales of products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property in the low single digits. The royalty is subject to reduction for any third-party payments required to be made, with a minimum floor in the low single digits. We have the right to sublicense our rights under this agreement, and we will be required to pay a percentage of any sublicense income. \n \u2022 Under a license agreement with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, pursuant to which we license certain patents relating to compositions and uses of T cells derived from iPSCs, CARs and genetic modifications using CRISPR, we are required to make annual maintenance payments and payments based upon development, regulatory and commercial milestones for any products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property. The maximum aggregate milestone payments we may be obligated to make per product are $12.5 million. We will also be required to pay a royalty on net sales of products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property up to the high-single digits. The royalty is subject to reduction for any third-party payments required to be made, with a minimum floor in the low- to mid-single digits. We have the right to sublicense our rights under this agreement, and we will be required to pay a percentage of any sublicense income. Additionally, in the event a licensed product achieves a specified clinical milestone, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center is then eligible to receive additional milestone payments, where the amount of such payments owed to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center are contingent upon certain increases in the price of our common stock following the date of achievement of such clinical milestone. \nWe enter into contracts in the normal course of business, including with clinical sites and professional service providers for the conduct of clinical trials, contract manufacturers for the production of our product candidates, contract research service providers for preclinical research studies, professional consultants for expert advice and vendors for the sourcing of clinical and laboratory supplies and materials. These contracts generally provide for termination on notice, and therefore are cancelable contracts and not included in the table of contractual obligations and commitments.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have, during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under the caption Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of programmed cellular immunotherapies for cancer and immune disorders. We are developing first-in-class cell therapy product candidates based on a simple notion: we believe that better cell therapies start with better cells.\nTo create better cell therapies, we use a therapeutic approach that we generally refer to as cell programming. For certain of our product candidates, we use pharmacologic modulators, such as small molecules, to enhance the biological properties and therapeutic function of healthy donor cells ex vivo before our product candidates are administered to a patient. In other cases, we use human iPSCs to generate a clonal master iPSC line having preferred biological properties, and direct the fate of the clonal master iPSC line to create our cell therapy product candidate. Analogous to master cell lines used to manufacture biopharmaceutical drug products such as monoclonal antibodies, we believe clonal master iPSC lines can be used as a renewable source for manufacturing cell therapy products which are well-defined and uniform in composition, can be repeatedly mass produced at significant scale in a cost-effective manner, and can be delivered off-the-shelf to treat many patients. Utilizing these therapeutic approaches, we program cells of the blood and immune system, including natural killer (NK) cells, T cells and CD34+ cells, and are advancing a pipeline of programmed cellular immunotherapies in the therapeutic areas of immuno-oncology and immuno-regulation.\nWe have entered into a research collaboration and license agreement with the Regents of the University of Minnesota to develop off-the-shelf NK cell cancer immunotherapies derived from clonal master iPSC lines. Additionally, we have entered into a research collaboration and license agreement with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (Memorial Sloan Kettering) to develop off-the-shelf, engineered T-cell cancer immunotherapies derived from clonal master iPSC lines.\nWe have entered into a collaboration and option agreement with Ono Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. for the joint development and commercialization of two off-the-shelf iPSC-derived CAR T-cell product candidates.\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in 2007, and are headquartered in San Diego, CA. Since our inception in 2007, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to our cell programming approach and the research and development of our product candidates, the creation, licensing and protection of related intellectual property, and the provision of general and administrative support for these activities. To date, we have funded our operations primarily through the public and private sale of common stock, the private placement of preferred stock and convertible notes, commercial bank debt and revenues from collaboration activities and grants.\nWe have never been profitable and have incurred net losses in each year since inception. Substantially all of our net losses resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We expect to continue to incur operating losses for at least the foreseeable future. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. We expect our expenses will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing and planned activities as we:\n \u2022 conduct our clinical trial of ProTmune under our own Investigational New Drug application; \n \u2022 conduct our clinical trials of FATE-NK100, including under investigator-sponsored clinical trial agreements with the University of Minnesota and under our own IND application; \n \u2022 conduct our clinical trials of FT500 and FT516 under our own IND applications; \n \u2022 conduct GMP manufacture, process development and technology transfer activities for the production of our product candidates, including those undergoing clinical investigation and IND-enabling preclinical development; \n \u2022 source clinical supplies and materials used to manufacture our product candidates; \n \u2022 conduct preclinical research, process development, manufacturing and development activities to support the clinical translation of our first-in-class product candidates derived from master iPSC lines; \n \u2022 conduct clinical trials of our product candidates; \n \u2022 build-out our own GMP manufacturing capabilities; \n \u2022 continue our research and development activities, including under our collaboration agreement with Ono; \n \u2022 maintain, prosecute, protect, expand and enforce our intellectual property portfolio; \n \u2022 engage with regulatory authorities for the development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates; \n \u2022 hire additional clinical, manufacturing, regulatory, quality control and technical personnel to advance our product candidates; \n \u2022 hire additional scientific personnel to advance our research and development efforts; and \n \u2022 hire general and administrative personnel to continue operating as a public company and support our operations. \nWe do not expect to generate any revenues from sales of any therapeutic products unless and until we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval for one or more of our product candidates, which we expect will take a number of years. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. Accordingly, we will seek to fund our operations through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements when needed would have a negative effect on our financial condition and ability to develop our product candidates.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nWe conduct substantially all of our activities through Fate Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation, at our facilities in San Diego, California. Fate Therapeutics, Inc. owns 100% of the voting shares of Fate Therapeutics Ltd. (Fate Ltd.), incorporated in the United Kingdom, whose operations have not been material to date. Effective May 2018, Fate Therapeutics, Inc. owns 100% of the voting shares of Tfinity Therapeutics, Inc. (Tfinity) and previously owned the majority of the voting shares of Tfinity and controlled Tfinity for consolidation purposes. To date, Tfinity has not had any material operations. The following information is presented on a consolidated basis to include the accounts of Fate Therapeutics, Inc., Tfinity, and Fate Ltd. All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation.\nIn February 2019, Fate Therapeutics B.V. (Fate B.V.), a wholly owned subsidiary of Fate Therapeutics, Inc. was incorporated in the Netherlands. The operations have Fate B.V. have not been material to date.\nCollaboration Revenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenues from therapeutic product sales. Our revenues have been derived from collaboration agreements and government grants.\nAgreement with Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.\nOn September 14, 2018, we entered into a Collaboration and Option Agreement (the Ono Agreement) with Ono Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (Ono) for the joint development and commercialization of two off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived CAR T-cell product candidates. Pursuant to the terms of the Ono Agreement, we received an upfront, non-refundable and non-creditable payment of $10.0 million. Additionally, we are entitled to receive fees for the conduct of research and preclinical development under a joint development plan, which fees are estimated to be $20.0 million in aggregate (of which $5.0 million was received in October 2018).\nWe concluded that Ono represented a customer and in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, we determined that the initial transaction price under the Ono Agreement equals $30.0 million, consisting of the upfront, non-refundable and non-creditable payment of $10.0 million and the aggregate estimated research and development fees of $20.0 million. In addition, we identified our performance obligations under the Ono Agreement, including our grant of a license to Ono to certain of our intellectual property subject to certain conditions, our conduct of research services, and our participation in a joint steering committee. We determined that all performance obligations should be accounted for as one combined performance obligation since no individual performance obligation is distinct, and that the combined performance obligation is transferred over the expected term of the conduct of the research services, which is estimated to be four years.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized $0.6 million of collaboration revenue under the Ono Agreement. As of December 31, 2018, aggregate deferred revenue related to the Ono Agreement was $14.4 million.\nAgreement with Juno Therapeutics, Inc.\nOn May 4, 2015, we entered into a strategic research collaboration and license agreement (the Juno Agreement) with Juno Therapeutics, Inc. (Juno) to screen for and identify small molecule modulators that enhance the therapeutic properties of Juno's genetically-engineered T-cell immunotherapies. Pursuant to the terms of the Juno Agreement, we received an upfront, non-refundable and non-creditable payment of $5.0 million and Juno purchased 1,000,000 shares of our common stock at $8.00 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $8.0 million. Additionally, we have received, and are entitled to receive, minimum annual research payments of $2.0 million for the conduct of research services during the initial four-year term of the Juno Agreement.\nWe determined that the common stock purchase by Juno represented a premium of $3.40 per share, or $3.4 million in aggregate (Equity Premium), and the remaining $4.6 million was recorded as issuance of common stock in shareholders' equity.\nIn accordance with ASC 606, we determined that the transaction price under the Juno Agreement equals $16.4 million, consisting of the upfront, non-refundable and non-creditable payment of $5.0 million, the $3.4 million Equity Premium and $8.0 million of estimated payments for the conduct of research services during the initial four-year term. In addition, we identified our performance obligations under the Juno Agreement, including our grant of an exclusive worldwide license to certain of our intellectual property subject to certain conditions, our conduct of research services and our participation in a joint research committee. We determined that all performance obligations should be accounted for as one combined performance obligation since no individual performance obligation is distinct, and that the combined performance obligation is transferred ratably over the expected term of conduct of the research services, which is four years.\nIn connection with the Juno Agreement, we have recognized $4.1 million and $4.1 million, respectively, during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, as collaboration revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. As of December 31, 2018, aggregate deferred revenue related to the Juno Agreement was $0.7 million.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist of costs associated with the research, preclinical development, manufacture and clinical development of our product candidates, the research and development of our cell programming technology including our iPSC product platform, and the performance of research and development activities under our collaboration agreements. These costs are expensed as incurred and include:\n \u2022 salaries and employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation; \n \u2022 costs incurred under clinical trial agreements with investigative sites; \n \u2022 costs to acquire, develop and manufacture preclinical study and clinical trial materials, including our product candidates; \n \u2022 costs associated with conducting our preclinical, process development, manufacturing, clinical and regulatory activities, including fees paid to third-party professional consultants, service providers and suppliers; \n \u2022 costs incurred under our collaboration agreements; \n \u2022 costs for research, laboratory and manufacturing materials and supplies; \n \u2022 costs incurred to license and maintain intellectual property; and \n \u2022 facilities, depreciation and other expenses including allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities. \nWe plan to increase our current level of research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue the clinical and preclinical development of our product candidates, research and develop our cell programming technology including our iPSC product platform, and perform our obligations under collaboration agreements including under our agreements with Ono, University of Minnesota and Memorial Sloan Kettering. Our current planned research and development activities over the next twelve months consist primarily of the following:\n \u2022 conducting clinical trials of our product candidates; \n \u2022 conducting GMP manufacture, process development and technology transfer activities for the production of our product candidates, including those undergoing clinical investigation and IND-enabling preclinical development; \n \u2022 source clinical supplies and materials used to manufacture our product candidates; \n \u2022 conducting preclinical research, process development, manufacturing and clinical translation activities to investigate the therapeutic potential of our immuno-oncology product candidates, and initiating and conducting first-in-human clinical trials of such product candidates; \n \u2022 conducting preclinical research and process development activities to investigate the therapeutic potential of our immuno-regulatory product candidates; and \n \u2022 performing research, preclinical development, process development, manufacturing and clinical translation activities under our sponsored research and collaboration agreements, including our agreements with Ono, University of Minnesota and Memorial Sloan Kettering. \nDue to the inherently unpredictable nature of preclinical and clinical development, and given our novel therapeutic approach and the current stage of development of our product candidates, we cannot determine and are unable to estimate with certainty the timelines we will require and the costs we will incur for the development of our product candidates, including ProTmune, FATE-NK100, FT500, FT516 and our other product candidates derived from clonal master iPSC lines. Clinical and preclinical development timelines and costs, and the potential of development success, can differ materially from expectations. In addition, we cannot forecast which product candidates may be subject to future collaborations, when such arrangements will be secured, if at all, and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation, for our employees in executive, operational, finance and human resource functions; professional fees for accounting, legal and tax services; costs for obtaining, prosecuting and maintaining our intellectual property; and other costs and fees, including director and officer insurance premiums, to support our operations as a public company. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our research and development activities, maintain compliance with exchange listing and SEC requirements and continue to operate as a public company.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther income (expense) consists primarily of interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents, interest income from short-term investments (including the amortization of discounts and premiums), and interest expense.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to accrued expenses and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report, we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant procedures, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update 2014-09 (ASU 2014-09), Topic 606, which created a single, principle-based revenue recognition model that supersedes and replaces nearly all existing U.S. GAAP revenue recognition guidance. We adopted ASU 2014-09 in the first quarter of 2018 using the full retrospective method. We evaluated the effect that the updated standard had on our internal processes, financial statements and related disclosures, and we determined that the adoption did not have a material impact on our historical consolidated financial statements.\nWe recognize revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of control of a product or a service to a customer and reflects the amount of the consideration we are entitled to receive in exchange for such product or service. In doing so, we follow a five-step approach: (i) identify the contract with a customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the customer obtains control of the product or service. We consider the terms of a contract and all relevant facts and circumstances when applying the revenue recognition standard. We apply the revenue recognition standard, including the use of any practical expedients, consistently to contracts with similar characteristics and in similar circumstances.\nA customer is a party that has entered into a contract with us, where the purpose of the contract is to obtain a product or a service that is an output of our ordinary activities in exchange for consideration. To be considered a contract, (i) the contract must be approved (in writing, orally, or in accordance with other customary business practices), (ii) each party's rights regarding the product or the service to be transferred can be identified, (iii) the payment terms for the product or the service to be transferred can be identified, (iv) the contract must have commercial substance (that is, the risk, timing or amount of future cash flows is expected to change as a result of the contract), and (v) it is probable that we will collect substantially all of the consideration to which we are entitled to receive in exchange for the transfer of the product or the service.\nA performance obligation is defined as a promise to transfer a product or a service to a customer. We identify each promise to transfer a product or a service (or a bundle of products or services, or a series of products and services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer) that is distinct. A product or a service is distinct if both (i) the customer can benefit from the product or the service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer and (ii) our promise to transfer the product or the service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. Each distinct promise to transfer a product or a service is a unit of accounting for revenue recognition. If a promise to transfer a product or a service is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contract, such promises should be combined into a single performance obligation.\nThe transaction price is the amount of consideration we are entitled to receive in exchange for the transfer of control of a product or a service to a customer. To determine the transaction price, we consider the existence of any significant financing component, the effects of any variable elements, noncash considerations and consideration payable to the customer. If a significant financing component exists, the transaction price is adjusted for the time value of money. If an element of variability exists, we must estimate the consideration we expect to receive and use that amount as the basis for recognizing revenue as the product or the service is transferred to the customer. There are two methods for determining the amount of variable consideration: (i) the expected value method, which is the sum of probability-weighted amounts in a range of possible consideration amounts, and (ii) the mostly likely amount method, which identifies the single most likely amount in a range of possible consideration amounts.\nIf a contract has multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in an amount that reflects the consideration we are entitled to receive in exchange for satisfying each distinct performance obligation. For each distinct performance obligation, revenue is recognized when (or as) we transfer control of the product or the service applicable to such performance obligation. To date, for collaboration arrangements that represent a single performance obligation, the revenues are recognized over time based on costs incurred compared to total estimated costs.\nIn those instances where we first receive consideration in advance of satisfying its performance obligation, we classify such consideration as deferred revenue until (or as) we satisfy such performance obligation. In those instances where we first satisfy our performance obligation prior to our receipt of consideration, the consideration is recorded as accounts receivable.\nWe expense incremental costs of obtaining a contract as and when incurred if the expected amortization period of the asset that would be recognized is one year or less, or if the amount of the asset is immaterial.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. Examples of accrued research and development expenses include amounts owed to clinical research organizations, to investigative sites in connection with clinical trials, to sponsored research organizations, to service providers in connection with preclinical development activities and to service providers related to product manufacturing, development and distribution of clinical supplies.\nWe base our accrued expenses related to clinical trials on our estimates of the services performed and efforts expended pursuant to our contractual arrangements, including those with clinical research organizations. The financial terms of these agreements are sometimes subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our service providers will exceed the level of services performed and result in a prepayment of the clinical expense. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical milestones. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid accordingly.\nAlthough we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from expenses actually incurred, if our estimates of the status and timing of services performed differs from the actual status and timing of services performed, we may report amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have been no material differences from our estimates to the amounts actually incurred.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense represents the grant date fair value of employee stock option and restricted stock unit grants recognized over the requisite service period of the awards (usually the vesting period) on a straight-line basis. For stock option grants with performance-based milestones, the expense is recorded over the remaining service period after the point when the achievement of the milestone is probable or the performance condition has been achieved. For stock option grants with both performance-based milestones and market conditions, expense is recorded over the derived service period after the point when the achievement of the performance-based milestone is probable or the performance condition has been achieved. We estimate the fair value of stock option grants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, with the exception of option grants with both performance-based milestones and market conditions, which are valued using a lattice based model. The fair value of restricted stock units is based on the closing price of our common stock as reported on The NASDAQ Global Market on the date of grant.\nWe account for stock options and restricted stock awards to non-employees using the fair value approach. Stock options and restricted stock awards to non-employees are subject to periodic revaluation over their vesting terms. For stock option grants with performance-based milestones, the expense is recorded over the remaining service period after the point when the performance condition is determined to be probable of achievement or when it has been achieved.\nWe generally estimate the fair value of our stock option awards to employees and non-employees using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including (a) the risk-free interest rate, (b) the expected volatility of our stock, (c) the expected term of the award and (d) the expected dividend yield. Due to the lack of an adequate history of a public market for the trading of our common stock and a lack of adequate company specific historical and implied volatility data, we have based our estimate of expected volatility on the historical volatility of a group of similar companies that are publicly traded. For these analyses, we have selected companies with comparable characteristics to ours including enterprise value, risk profiles, position within the industry, and with historical share price information sufficient to meet the expected life of the stock-based awards. We compute the historical volatility data using the daily closing prices for the selected companies' shares during the equivalent period of the calculated expected term of our stock-based awards. We will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available. We have estimated the expected life of our employee stock options using the simplified\u201d method, whereby, the expected life equals the average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option. The risk-free interest rates for periods within the expected life of the option are based on the yields of zero-coupon U.S. Treasury securities. See Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nTotal stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, was $6.3 million, $3.6 million, and $3.2 million, respectively. Expense related to unvested employee stock option grants not yet recognized as of December 31, 2018 was approximately $15.9 million and the weighted-average period over which these grants are expected to vest is 3.1 years. As of December 31, 2018, the unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding restricted stock units was $0.4 million, which is expected to be recognized as expense over approximately 0.8 years.\nOther Company Information\nJOBS Act\nOn April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act), was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company\u201d can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. As of December 31, 2018, we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company.\nSubject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, as we are no longer an emerging growth company,\u201d we are subject to certain additional requirements, including without limitation, (i) providing an auditor's attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) complying with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements, known as the auditor discussion and analysis.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements, please see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nThe following table summarizes the results of our operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\n\nRevenue.

The year ended December 31, 2017 also included a $0.1 million loss on debt extinguishment related to the amendment of our loan agreement with Silicon Valley Bank.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have incurred losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception. As of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $285.4 million and anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of the net cash flow activity for each of the years ended December 31:\n\nOperating Activities\nCash used in operating activities increased from $36.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $38.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The primary driver of this change in cash used in operating activities was our increase in net loss from 2017 to 2018, partially offset by an increase of $14.4 million in deferred revenue resulting primarily from entering into our collaboration agreement with Ono and a one-time, non-cash expense of $6.1 million incurred from the issuance of common stock to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Gladstone in connection with those license agreements.\nCash used in operating activities increased from $29.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $36.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The primary driver of this change in cash used in operating activities was our increase in net loss from 2016 to 2017, partially offset by an increase of $1.0 million in deferred rent resulting from the office and lab expansion in January 2017 and an increase of $1.0 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses.\nAgreement with Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.\nOn September 14, 2018, we entered into the Ono Agreement with Ono for the joint development and commercialization of two off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived CAR T-cell product candidates (each a Candidate and collectively the Candidates). Under the terms of the Ono Agreement, Ono paid to us an upfront, non-refundable and non-creditable payment of $10.0 million. Additionally, as consideration for our conduct of research and preclinical development under a joint development plan, Ono pays us annual research and development fees set forth in the annual budget included in the joint development plan, which fees are estimated to be $20.0 million in aggregate over the course of the joint development plan. Further, under the terms of the Ono Agreement, Ono has agreed to pay us up to an additional $40.0 million, subject to the achievement of a preclinical milestone and the exercise by Ono of its options to obtain exclusive licenses to develop and commercialize the Candidates. Such fees are in addition to the upfront payment and research and development fees.\nSubject to Ono's exercise of its options to obtain exclusive licenses to develop and commercialize the Candidates and to the achievement of certain clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones with respect to each Candidate in specified territories, we are entitled to receive an aggregate of up to $285.0 million in milestone payments for Candidate 1 and an aggregate of up to $895.0 million in milestone payments for Candidate 2, with the applicable milestone payments for Candidate 2 for the United States and Europe subject to reduction by 50% if we elect to co-develop and co-commercialize Candidate 2 as described above. As of December 31, 2018, we have not received any such milestone payments. We are also eligible to receive tiered royalties ranging from the mid-single digits to the low-double digits based on annual net sales by Ono of each Candidate in specified territories, with such royalties subject to certain reductions. As of December 31, 2018, no royalties have been paid to us.\nAs a direct result of our entry into the Ono Agreement, we incurred an aggregate of $2.0 million in sublicense consideration to existing licensors of ours. The $2.0 million sublicense consideration represents an asset under ASC 340, Other Assets and Deferred Costs. As of December 31, 2018, $1.0 million of such consideration has been paid, while the remaining $1.0 million remains in account payable.\nAgreement with Juno Therapeutics, Inc.\nOn May 4, 2015, we entered into a strategic research collaboration and license agreement with Juno to screen for and identify small molecule modulators that enhance the therapeutic properties of Juno's genetically-engineered T-cell immunotherapies. Pursuant to the terms of the Juno Agreement, Juno paid us an upfront, non-refundable and non-creditable payment of $5.0 million, and purchased one million shares of our common stock, at $8.00 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $8.0 million. Additionally, Juno agreed to fund all of our collaboration research activities for an initial four-year research term beginning on the effective date of the Juno Agreement, with minimum annual research payments of $2.0 million to us. Juno has the option to extend the exclusive research term for an additional two years beyond the initial four-year term, subject to the payment of a one-time, non-refundable extension fee of $3.0 million and the continued funding of our activities under the collaboration during the extended term, with minimum annual research payments of $4.0 million to us during the two-year extension period. As of December 31, 2018, we have received a total of $6.8 million of such research payments. We received a $0.5 million research payment during January 2019.\nWe are eligible under the Juno Agreement to receive selection fees for each tumor-associated antigen target selected by Juno and bonus selection fees based on the aggregate number of tumor-associated antigen targets selected by Juno. Additionally, in connection with each Juno therapy that uses or incorporates our small molecule modulators, Juno has agreed to pay us non-refundable, non-creditable milestone payments totaling up to approximately $51.0 million, in the aggregate, per therapy upon the achievement of various clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones. Additionally, in connection with the third Juno therapy and the fifth Juno therapy that uses or incorporates our small molecule modulators, Juno has agreed to pay us additional non-refundable, non-creditable bonus milestone payments totaling up to approximately $116.0 million and $137.5 million, respectively, in the aggregate, per therapy upon the achievement of various clinical, regulatory, and commercial milestones. As of December 31, 2018, we have not received any selection fees or milestone payments.\nBeginning on the date of the first commercial sale (in each country) for each Juno therapy that uses or incorporates our small molecule modulators, and continuing until the later of i) the expiration of the last valid patent claim, ii) ten years after such first commercial sale, or iii) the expiration of all data and other regulatory exclusivity periods afforded each therapy, Juno has agreed to pay us royalties in the low single-digits on net sales of each Juno therapy that uses or incorporates our small molecule modulators. As of December 31, 2018, no royalties have been paid to us.\nIn March 2018, Juno was acquired by Celgene Corporation (Celgene). This acquisition did not affect the terms of our agreement with Juno Agreement. On January 3, 2019, Celgene announced that it had entered into a definitive merger agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS), under which BMS will acquire Celgene.\nMemorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center License Agreement\nOn May 15, 2018, we entered into an Amended and Restated Exclusive License Agreement with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK). The agreement amends and restates the license agreement entered into between us and MSK on August 19, 2016. In consideration for the additional rights granted under the May 2018 agreement, we issued 500,000 shares of our common stock to MSK, which shares were valued at $4.8 million on the date of agreement. We also paid an upfront cash fee of $0.5 million, and we are obligated to pay milestone payments upon the achievement of specified clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones and royalty payments to MSK on net sales of licensed products. We are also obligated to pay MSK a percentage of certain sublicense income received by us. Furthermore, in the event a licensed product achieves a specified clinical milestone, MSK is then eligible to receive additional milestone payments, where the amount of such payments owed to MSK are contingent upon certain increases in the price of the Company's common stock following the date of achievement of such clinical milestone.\nJ. David Gladstone Institutes License Agreement\nOn September 11, 2018, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with the J. David Gladstone Institutes (Gladstone). Pursuant to the Gladstone license agreement, we issued 100,000 shares of our common stock to Gladstone, which shares were valued at $1.3 million on the date of the agreement. We also paid an upfront cash fee of $0.1 million, and we are obligated to pay milestone payments in an aggregate amount of up to approximately $1.9 million upon the achievement of specified clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones and as well as royalties to Gladstone in the low single digits on net sales of licensed products. We are also obligated to pay Gladstone a tiered percentage in the low to mid-single digits of certain sublicense income received by us.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, investing activities used cash of $0.5 million, $10.2 million and $4.1 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2018 we purchased $55.7 million in U.S. Treasuries as short-term investments, offset by $57.5 million in maturities of these short-term investments. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we purchased $40.0 million in U.S. Treasuries as short-term investments, offset by $31.5 million in maturities of these short-term investments. The remaining investing activities for the periods presented were primarily attributable to the purchase of property and equipment.\nFinancing Activities\nFinancing activities provided cash of $140.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which primarily consisted of the $134.9 million of net proceeds from our September 2018 public offering of common stock and $3.5 million of proceeds from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) award.\nFinancing activities provided cash of $47.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which primarily consisted of $43.2 million of net proceeds from our December 2017 public offering of common stock and $15.0 million of proceeds from the July 14, 2017 amendment to our loan agreement with Silicon Valley Bank, offset by $10.8 million of principal payments on our term loans outstanding with Silicon Valley Bank.\nFinancing activities provided cash of $57.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which primarily consisted of $36.4 million of net proceeds from our November 2016 private placement issuance of Class A convertible preferred stock, $18.6 million of net proceeds from our November 2016 private placement issuance of common stock and $10.2 million of net proceeds from our August 2016 private placement issuance of common stock, offset by $7.7 million of principal payments on our term loans outstanding with Silicon Valley Bank.\nFrom our inception through December 31, 2018 we have funded our consolidated operations primarily through the public and private sale of common stock, the private placement of preferred stock and convertible notes, commercial bank debt and revenues from collaboration activities and grants. As of December 31, 2018, we had aggregate cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $201.0 million.\nPublic Offering of Common Stock\nIn September 2018, we completed a public offering of common stock in which investors, certain of which are affiliated with our directors, purchased 10,648,149 shares of our common stock at a price of $13.50 per share under our shelf registration statement. Gross proceeds from the offering were $143.8 million. After giving effect to $8.9 million in underwriting discounts, commissions and expenses related to the offering, net proceeds were $134.9 million.\nIn December 2017, we completed a public offering of common stock in which investors purchased 10,953,750 shares of our common stock at a price of $4.20 per share under a shelf registration statement. Gross proceeds from the offering were $46.0 million. After giving effect to an estimated $3.0 million of costs related to the offering (of which $0.3 million was paid during 2018), net proceeds were $43.0 million.\nCalifornia Institute for Regenerative Medicine Award\nOn April 5, 2018, we executed an award agreement with CIRM pursuant to which CIRM awarded us up to $4.0 million to advance our FT516 product candidate into a first-in-human clinical trial for the treatment of subjects with advanced solid tumors, including in combination with monoclonal antibody therapy (the Award). Pursuant to the terms of the Award, we are eligible to receive five disbursements in varying amounts totaling $4.0 million throughout the project period of the Award, which was estimated to be from April 1, 2018 to June 30, 2019 (the Project Period). In December 2018, we discussed with CIRM our intent to pursue the clinical development of FT516 in relapsed / refractory hematologic malignancies in addition to advanced solid tumors, and our preference to first submit an IND application for FT516 in relapsed / refractory hematologic malignancies rather than in advanced solid tumors. In January 2019, we submitted our IND application for FT516 in relapsed / refractory hematologic malignancies, which IND submission was allowed by the FDA in February 2019. We agreed with CIRM to suspend the Award until such time as we elect to proceed with our submission of an IND application for FT516 in advanced solid tumors. At the time of suspension, an additional $0.5 million was available for funding under the Award.\nThe Award is subject to certain co-funding requirements by us. Following the conclusion of the Project Period, we, in our sole discretion, have the option to treat the Award either as a loan or as a grant. In the event we elect to treat the Award as a loan, we will be obligated to repay i) 60%, ii) 80%, iii) 100% or iv) 100% plus interest at 7% plus LIBOR, of the total Award to CIRM, where such repayment rate is dependent upon the phase of clinical development of FT516 at the time of our election. If we do not elect to treat the Award as a loan within 10 years of the date of the Award, the Award will be considered a grant and we will be obligated to pay to CIRM a royalty on commercial sales of FT516 until such royalty payments equal nine times the total amount awarded to us under the Award.\nPrivate Placements of Common and Convertible Preferred Stock\nIn November 2016, we completed a private placement of stock in which investors purchased shares of our Class A convertible Preferred Stock and common stock. We issued 2,819,549 shares of non-voting Class A Preferred Stock at $13.30 per share, each of which is convertible into five shares of common stock upon certain conditions. We also issued 7,236,837 shares of common stock at $2.66 per share. Gross proceeds from the private placement were $56.7 million. After giving effect to costs related to the private placement, net proceeds were $54.9 million.\nIn August 2016, we completed a private placement of common stock in which investors purchased 5,250,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $1.96 per share. Gross proceeds from the private placement were $10.3 million, and after giving effect to costs related to the private placement, net proceeds were $10.2 million.\nSilicon Valley Bank Debt Facility\nOn July 30, 2014, we entered into an Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (Restated LSA) with Silicon Valley Bank (Bank), collateralized by substantially all of our assets, excluding certain intellectual property. The Restated LSA amends and restates the Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of January 5, 2009, as amended, by and between us and the Bank (Loan Agreement). Pursuant to the Restated LSA, the Bank agreed to make loans to us in an aggregate principal amount of up to $20.0 million, comprised of (i) a $10.0 million term loan, funded at the closing date (Term A Loan) and (ii) subject to the achievement of a specified clinical milestone, additional term loans totaling up to $10.0 million in the aggregate, which were available until December 31, 2014 (each, Term B Loan). On December 24, 2014, we elected to draw $10.0 million under the Term B Loan.\nOn July 14, 2017, the Company and the Bank entered into an amendment (SVB Loan Amendment) of the Restated LSA where the Bank extended an additional term loan to the Company in the principal amount of $15.0 million (2017 Term Loan), a portion of which was applied to repay in full all amounts previously outstanding under the Restated LSA. Following such repayment in full of the Company's existing outstanding debt with the Bank under the Restated LSA, cash proceeds to the Company from the remaining portion of the Term Loan were $7.5 million.\nThe 2017 Term Loan matures on January 1, 2022 (Term Loan Maturity Date). The 2017 Term Loan bears interest at a floating per annum rate equal to the greater of (i) 3.50% above the Prime Rate (as defined in the SVB Loan Amendment) or (ii) 7.25%; provided, however, that in no event shall such interest rate exceed 8.25%. Interest is payable on a monthly basis on the first day of each month. From August 1, 2017 through January 1, 2019 (Interest-only Period), the Company was required to make monthly payments of interest only. In January 2019, after achievement of a product development milestone, the Company elected to extend the Interest-only Period from January 1, 2019 through and including to July 1, 2019. The Company is required to repay the principal, plus monthly payments of accrued interest, in 30 equal monthly installments based on a 30-month amortization schedule. The Company's final payment, due on the Term Loan Maturity Date, shall include all outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest under the 2017 Term Loan, plus a 7.5% final payment fee.\nSubject to certain conditions, including the payment of a prepayment fee in the amount 1% of the principal amount of the Term Loan for any prepayment made before July 14, 2019, the Company may voluntarily prepay all, but not less than all, of the 2017 Term Loan.\nIn connection with the SVB Loan Amendment, the Company issued to the Bank on the First Amendment Effective Date a warrant to purchase up to an aggregate of 91,463 shares of the Company's common stock, subject to adjustment, at an exercise price equal to $3.28 per share. All such warrants have been exercised as of December 31, 2018.\nWe are required under the Loan Agreement, as amended by the SVB Loan Amendment, to maintain our deposit and securities accounts with the Bank and to comply with various default clauses and operating covenants that may restrict our ability to finance our operations, engage in business activities or expand or fully pursue our business strategies. A breach of any of these covenants or clauses could result in a default under the Loan Agreement, which could cause all of the outstanding indebtedness under the facility to become immediately due and payable.\nAgreement with Juno Therapeutics, Inc.\nPursuant to the terms of our Agreement with Juno, Juno purchased one million shares of our common stock, at $8.00 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $8.0 million in May 2015, $4.6 million of which was considered an equity component of the transaction.\nRegistration Statements on Form S-3\nIn November 2018, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement (File No. 333-228513), which became effective upon filing. The shelf registration statement allows us to issue certain securities, including shares of our common stock, from time to time. The specific terms of any offering, if any, under the automatic shelf registration statement would be established at the time of such offering. Additionally, we entered into a sales agreement with Leerink Partners LLC (Leerink) with respect to an at-the-market offering program, under which we may offer and sell, from time to time at our sole discretion, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $50.0 million through Leerink as its sales agent.\nIn May 2018, the SEC declared effective a shelf registration statement filed by us in May 2018 (File No. 333-224680). The shelf registration statement allows us to issue certain securities, including shares of our common stock, from time to time. The specific terms of any offering, if any, under the shelf registration statement would be established at the time of such offering. As of December 31, 2018, after giving effect to our September 2018 public offering, we are eligible to issue an aggregate of $6.2 million in securities under this shelf registration statement.\nIn August 2017, the SEC declared effective a shelf registration statement filed by us in August 2017 (File No. 333-219987). The shelf registration statement allows us to issue certain securities, including shares of our common stock, from time to time. The specific terms of any offering, if any, under the shelf registration statement would be established at the time of such offering. As of December 31, 2018, after giving effect to our December 2017 public offering, we are eligible to issue an aggregate of $54.0 million in securities under the shelf registration statement. In addition, this registration statement registered for resale one million shares of common stock held by Juno, which were issued in May 2015 as described below.\nOperating Capital Requirements\nWe anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect the losses to increase as we continue the research and development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates and conduct additional research and development activities pursuant to our collaboration agreements with Juno and Ono. Our product candidates have not yet achieved regulatory approval, and we may not be successful in achieving commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2018 will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements for at least the next twelve months. However, we are subject to all the risks and uncertainties incident in the research and development of therapeutic products. For example, the FDA or other regulatory authorities may require us to generate additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies or clinical trials, or may impose other requirements beyond those that we currently anticipate. Additionally, it is possible for a product candidate to show promising results in preclinical studies or in clinical trials, but fail to establish sufficient safety and efficacy data necessary to obtain regulatory approvals. As a result of these and other risks and uncertainties and the probability of success, the duration and the cost of our research and development activities required to advance a product candidate cannot be accurately estimated and are subject to considerable variation. We may encounter difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors and unforeseen expenses in the course of our research and development activities, any of which may significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely affect our liquidity.\nWe will require additional capital for the research and development of our product candidates and to perform our research and development obligations under our collaboration agreements with Juno and Ono, and we may be forced to seek additional funds sooner than expected to pursue our research and development activities. We expect to finance our capital requirements in the foreseeable future through the sale of public or private equity or debt securities. However, additional capital may not be available to us on reasonable terms, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the research or development of one or more of our product candidates. If we do raise additional funds through the issuance of additional equity or debt securities, it could result in dilution to our existing stockholders, increased fixed payment obligations and the existence of securities with rights that may be senior to those of our common stock. Additionally, if we incur indebtedness, we may become subject to financial or other covenants that could adversely restrict, impair or affect our ability to conduct our business, such as requiring us to relinquish rights to certain of our product candidates or technologies or limiting our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights or incur additional debt. Any of these events could significantly harm our business, operations, financial condition and prospects.\nOur forecast of the period of time through which our existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement and involves significant risks and uncertainties. We have based this forecast on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and actual results could vary materially from our expectations, which may adversely affect our capital resources and liquidity. We could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. The amount and timing of future funding requirements, both near- and long-term, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n \u2022 the initiation, timing, progress, size, duration, costs and results of our clinical trials and preclinical studies for our product candidates; \n \u2022 the number and the nature of product candidates that we pursue; \n \u2022 the cost of manufacturing and process development of our product candidates, including the cost of supplies and materials to support these activities; \n \u2022 the time, cost and outcome of seeking and obtaining regulatory approvals; \n \u2022 the extent to which we are required to pay milestone or other payments under our in-license agreements and the timing of such payments; \n \u2022 the extent to which milestones are achieved under our collaboration agreements with Juno and Ono, and the time to achievement of such milestones and our receipt of any associated milestone payments; \n \u2022 the cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights; \n \u2022 the expansion of our research and development activities, including our need and ability to hire additional employees and procure additional equipment, materials and supplies; \n \u2022 the establishment and continuation of collaborations and strategic alliances; \n \u2022 the timing and terms of future in-licensing and out-licensing transactions; and \n \u2022 the cost of establishing sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution capabilities for, and the pricing and reimbursement of, any products for which we may receive regulatory approval. \nIf we cannot continue or expand our research and development operations, or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, because we lack sufficient capital, our business, operations, financial condition and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2018 that are expected to affect our liquidity and cash flows in future periods:\n\nOur long-term debt bears interest at a floating per annum rate equal to the greater of (i) 3.50% above the Prime Rate (as defined in the SVB Loan Amendment) or (ii) 7.25%; provided, however, that in no event shall such interest rate exceed 8.25%. The amounts in the table above assume payment at our current interest rate of 8.25%, which is subject to change. The amounts in the above table also reflect the actual Interest-only Period through July 31, 2019.\nWe lease certain office and laboratory space under a non-cancelable operating lease. In May 2018, we amended the operating lease, extending the term of the lease through approximately 2028 and agreeing to lease additional space comprising approximately 24,000 square feet in the same building as our existing space for a total occupancy of approximately 72,000 square feet under the lease. In addition to rent, the lease is subject to certain fixed amenities fees. The above table includes all such fixed fees. The lease is subject to additional variable charges for common area maintenance and other costs. We maintain the right to terminate the lease after October 2025, subject to our delivery to the landlord of twelve months' prior written notice and an early termination payment of $2.5 million. See Note 6 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\nWe have no material contractual obligations not fully recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets or fully disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.\nWe have obligations under various license agreements to make future payments to third parties that become due and payable on the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones (such as the start of a clinical trial, filing for product approval with the FDA or other regulatory agencies, product approval by the FDA or other regulatory agencies, product launch or product sales) or on the sublicense of our rights to another party. We have not included these commitments on our balance sheet or in the table above because the achievement and timing of these events is not fixed and determinable. Certain milestones are in advance of receipt of revenue from the sale of products and, therefore, we may require additional debt or equity capital to make such payments. These commitments include:\n \u2022 Under a license agreement with Children's Medical Center Corporation pursuant to which we license certain patents relating to our ex vivo cell programming approach and our programmed hematopoietic cell therapies, we are required to make annual maintenance payments and payments based upon development, regulatory and commercial milestones for any products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property. The maximum aggregate milestone payments we may be obligated to make per product are $5.0 million. We will also be required to pay a royalty on net sales of products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property in the low- to mid-single digits. The royalty is subject to reduction for any third-party payments required to be made, with a minimum floor in the low single digits. We have the right to sublicense our rights under this agreement, and we will be required to pay a percentage of any sublicense income. \n \u2022 Under a license agreement with the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, pursuant to which we license certain patents relating to our iPSC product platform, we are required to make annual maintenance payments and payments based upon development, regulatory and commercial milestones for any products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property. The maximum aggregate milestone payments we may be obligated to make per product are $2.3 million. We will also be required to pay a royalty on net sales of products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property in the low single digits. The royalty is subject to reduction for any third-party payments required to be made, with a minimum floor in the low single digits. We have the right to sublicense our rights under this agreement, and we will be required to pay a percentage of any sublicense income. \n \u2022 Under license agreements with The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI), pursuant to which we license certain patents relating to our iPSC product platform, we are required to make annual maintenance payments and payments based upon development, regulatory and commercial milestones for any products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property. The maximum aggregate milestone payments we may be obligated to make are $1.8 million. We will also be required to pay a royalty on net sales of products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property in the low- to mid-single digits. The royalty is subject to reduction for any third-party payments required to be made, with a minimum floor in the low single digits. We have the right to sublicense our rights under these agreements, and we will be required to pay a percentage of any sublicense income. \n \u2022 Under a license agreement with the Regents of the University of Minnesota, pursuant to which we license certain patents relating to compositions and uses of NK cells and to compositions of engineered receptors and immune cells expressing such receptors, we are required to make annual maintenance payments and payments based upon development, regulatory and commercial milestones for any products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property. The maximum aggregate milestone payments we may be obligated to make per product are $4.6 million. We will also be required to pay a royalty on net sales of products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property in the low single digits. The royalty is subject to reduction for any third-party payments required to be made, with a minimum floor in the low single digits. We have the right to sublicense our rights under this agreement, and we will be required to pay a percentage of any sublicense income. \n \u2022 Under a license agreement with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, pursuant to which we license certain patents relating to compositions and uses of T cells derived from iPSCs, CARs and genetic modifications using CRISPR, we are required to make annual maintenance payments and payments based upon development, regulatory and commercial milestones for any products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property. The maximum aggregate milestone payments we may be obligated to make per product are $12.5 million. We will also be required to pay a royalty on net sales of products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property up to the high-single digits. The royalty is subject to reduction for any third-party payments required to be made, with a minimum floor in the low- to mid-single digits. We have the right to sublicense our rights under this agreement, and we will be required to pay a percentage of any sublicense income. Additionally, in the event a licensed product achieves a specified clinical milestone, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center is then eligible to receive additional milestone payments, where the amount of such payments owed to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center are contingent upon certain increases in the price of our common stock following the date of achievement of such clinical milestone. \nWe enter into contracts in the normal course of business, including with clinical sites and professional service providers for the conduct of clinical trials, contract manufacturers for the production of our product candidates, contract research service providers for preclinical research studies, professional consultants for expert advice and vendors for the sourcing of clinical and laboratory supplies and materials. These contracts generally provide for termination on notice, and therefore are cancelable contracts and not included in the table of contractual obligations and commitments.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have, during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.", "item_7_tables": "Table 223: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase/\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Collaboration revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,740\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 56,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,935\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other (income) expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (494\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,321\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>Table 231: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase/\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Collaboration revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (296\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (672\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>Table 239: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (38,650\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (36,817\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (29,823\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (463\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10,196\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,114\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 140,780\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 47,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 57,737\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 101,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>Table 251: <table> <tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years 1 -

The information contains forward-looking statements, and actual results could materially differ due to various risks and uncertainties, as outlined in the \"Risk Factors\" section. \n\nThe company is focused on developing programmed cellular immunotherapies for cancer and immune disorders. It employs a cell programming approach aimed at enhancing the therapeutic properties of cells used in treatments. The company has collaborations with the University of Minnesota and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center for developing natural killer (NK) cell and T-cell therapies, respectively, and it has partnered with Ono Pharmaceutical for developing CAR T-cell product candidates. \n\nSince its establishment in 2007, the company has mainly focused on research and development, with a consistent track record of net losses each year, a trend expected to continue. Expenses are anticipated to grow due to clinical trials, manufacturing, research activities, and building out manufacturing capabilities, among other operations.\n\nThe company's overall financial strategy includes raising funds through public or private equity or debt financing, though it acknowledges risks in securing capital on favorable terms or at all.\n\nConcerning financial operations, the company conducts most of its activities through its entity, Fate Therapeutics Inc., in San Diego, California, and has wholly-owned subsidiaries in the UK and the Netherlands, although these have had no significant operations to date.\n\nRevenue for the company so far has come from collaboration agreements and grants, not product sales. Regarding agreements, notable ones include those with Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. and Juno Therapeutics, Inc., which involve upfront payments, research funding, milestone payments, and royalties on future product sales.\n\nThe company's expenses are primarily research and development costs, contributing to the bulk of net losses over the years, with general and administrative expenses also playing a part. These expenditures are expected to rise as the company scales up its development activity.\n\nCash flow aspects highlight an increase in cash used for operating activities from 2017 to 2018, with the primary factors being a rise in net loss and an increase in deferred revenue mainly from the Ono collaboration. Financing activities have provided significant cash flow, mainly through equity financing activities. \n\nThe company emphasizes that it has sufficient funds to maintain current operations for at least the next year. However, to support further R&D and commercialization efforts, additional funding will be needed, which they may obtain through issuing stock, partnerships, or debt, all of which come with potential dilutive effects or restrictive terms.\n\nThe report also discusses the company's critical accounting policies and estimates, highlighting how revenue recognition, accrued R&D expenses, and stock-based compensation are accounted for, reflecting on the significant judgments and assumptions made in the financial statements.\n\nFinally, the company reviews its liquidity and capital resources, detailing its contractual obligations, off-balance sheet arrangements, and the need for further capital to continue or expand R&D operations. Potential future funding sources are briefly discussed, with the caveat that there is no guarantee these funds can be secured on favorable terms."}
