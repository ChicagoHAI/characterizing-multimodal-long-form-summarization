MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that are included under Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K. Also refer to Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d which is included after the Table of Contents in this Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis also includes non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide important perspective in understanding trends that may impact our business. These non-GAAP financial measures are discussed, including reconciliation of these measures to GAAP, under Non-GAAP Financial Information.\u201d\nThis section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. Discussions of 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 are not included in this Form 10-K and can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 2, 2020.\nOur Business\nCore-Mark is one of the largest marketers of fresh, food and broad-line supply solutions to the convenience retail industry in North America. We offer a full range of products, marketing programs and technology solutions to approximately 40,000 customer locations in the U.S. and Canada. Our customers include traditional convenience stores, drug stores, mass merchants, grocery stores, liquor stores, and other specialty and small format stores that carry convenience products. Our product offering includes cigarettes, other tobacco products ( OTP\u201d), alternative nicotine products, candy, snacks, food, including fresh products, groceries, dairy, bread, beverages, general merchandise and health and beauty care products. We operate a network of 32 distribution centers in the U.S. and Canada (excluding two distribution facilities we operate as a third-party logistics provider).\nBusiness Strategy Overview\nCore-Mark's mission is to be the most valued marketer of fresh, food and broad-line supply solutions to the convenience retail industry. Consistent with this mission, our strategic framework is centered around three key initiatives: growing sales and margins faster than the industry, providing industry-leading category management solutions and leveraging our cost structure. The convenience wholesale and retail industry remains highly fragmented, supporting significant opportunities for both organic growth and growth through strategic acquisitions. Core-Mark is one of the largest wholesale distributors to the convenience retail industry in North America, one of two national convenience distributors in the U.S. and the largest in Canada, and represents an estimated 7% market share of the in-store sales of convenience stores in North America.\nOur growth initiatives include elevating same store sales, gaining share of North American convenience stores and being opportunistic with traditional and industry-adjacent acquisition opportunities. While serving traditional convenience retailers remains the primary driver for our business, we serve a wide variety of alternative convenience retail formats including mass merchandisers, casinos, colleges and airports. Driving growth through these alternative convenience retail formats and channels is a core component of our strategy and we see significant opportunities to drive growth organically, through acquisitions and strategic partnerships. Our focus on providing industry-leading category management solutions to our customers positions us to partner with retailers to help increase their sales and profits. We offer a wide array of marketing programs, innovative product alternatives, data aggregation and loyalty solutions to our customers in pursuit of category management excellence. Core-Mark is also actively engaged in efforts to increase the leverage of our operating cost structure through a range of initiatives, including technology investments, centralizing transactional processes and employee engagement aimed at increasing productivity.\nWe believe consistent execution on the aforementioned strategic priorities will position Core-Mark as the leader in convenience retail distribution and provides a strong pathway to achieve sustainable shareholder returns.\nOther Business Developments\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on our operating results during the year ended December 31, 2020, and we expect the pandemic will continue to affect our business for some period of time. While the vast majority of our customers are convenience retailers that continue to operate as essential businesses, the unprecedented impact of the COVID-19 pandemic since the second quarter of 2020, including shelter-in-place orders by states, provinces, cities and counties resulted in a significant downturn in miles driven, resulting in a decline in convenience retail store visits across North America. Although we are seeing recovery as consumer purchase trends improve, we expect future results to continue to be impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDividends\nThe Board of Directors approved the following cash dividends in 2020 (in millions, except per share data):\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Declaration Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Dividend Per Share </td> <td> </td> <td>Record Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Cash Payment Amount(1)(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Payment Date </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>February 24, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.12 </td> <td> </td> <td>March 16, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$5.5 </td> <td> </td> <td>March 27, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>May 7, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.12 </td> <td> </td> <td>May 22, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$5.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>June 19, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>August 6, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.12 </td> <td> </td> <td>August 21, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$5.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>September 18, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>November 5, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.13 </td> <td> </td> <td>November 20, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$5.7 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 18, 2020 </td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________________________________________\n(1) Includes cash payments on declared dividends and payments made on time-based restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d) and performance share awards that vested subsequent to the payment date.\n(2) Amounts have been rounded for presentation purposes and may differ from unrounded amounts.\nWe paid dividends of $22.0 million and $20.8 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn February 24, 2020, our Board of Directors authorized a $60.0 million stock repurchase program (the 2020 Program\u201d), replacing our prior stock repurchase program (the Prior Program\u201d). At the time of approval, we had funds totaling $0.4 million remaining under the Prior Program which were subsequently retired unused. The timing, price and volume of purchases under the 2020 Program are based on market conditions, cash and liquidity requirements, relevant securities laws and other factors. The 2020 Program may be discontinued or amended at any time. The 2020 Program has no expiration date and terminates when the amount authorized has been expended or the Board of Directors withdraws its authorization.\nIn 2020, all stock repurchases were made under the 2020 Program, and we repurchased 407,971 shares of common stock for a total cost of $10.4 million, or an average price of $25.62 per share. As of December 31, 2020, $49.6 million remained available for future share repurchases under the 2020 Program. In 2019, under the Prior Program, we repurchased 767,681 shares of common stock for a total cost of $22.0 million, or an average price of $28.66 per share.\nOverview of 2020 Results\nDuring 2020, we continued to build on our sales and operational capabilities, as well as our financial foundation, to drive our long-term growth strategy. We delivered strong financial results and further enhanced our industry-leading offering of products and services despite the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur net sales in 2020 increased 1.7%, or $287.4 million, to $16,957.9 million compared to $16,670.5 million for 2019. The increase in net sales for the year was driven primarily by strong cigarette sales, including increases in cigarette manufacturers' prices and growth in cigarette carton sales, partially offset by a 2.3% decrease in sales of food/non-food. Sales of cigarettes and food/non-food products for the year were impacted by changes in consumer buying habits as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nGross profit in 2020 decreased $35.9 million, or 3.9%, to $888.3 million from $924.2 million in 2019, driven primarily by a shift in overall sales mix to cigarettes, which have lower margins compared with food/non-food products, and higher LIFO expense, partially offset by $1.9 million of incremental net inventory holding gains.\nGross profit margin was 5.24% of total net sales for 2020 compared to 5.54% in 2019. Remaining gross profit margin(1) decreased to 5.23% for 2020 from 5.53% in 2019. The decline in remaining gross profit margin was driven primarily by the change in the sales mix between cigarettes and food/non-food and a decline in margins within the food/non-food category resulting from a shift in sales mix and lower gross profit margins in certain categories. We expect our gross profit margin to continue to be impacted by both sales mix and lower margins in certain product categories for some period of time as a direct result of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOperating expenses in 2020 decreased 4.6%, or $38.0 million, to $793.6 million from $831.6 million in 2019. The decrease was driven primarily by increased productivity and cost savings initiatives, implemented mainly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As outlined in our press release on April 14, 2020, we took steps during the second quarter to reduce operating costs to better align them with sales volume trends and to preserve liquidity. We also achieved cost savings through actions to reduce other non-essential costs including travel, meetings and events and other discretionary expenditures. Operating expenses were 4.7% of total net sales for 2020 compared to 5.0% in 2019. Operating expenses were 89.4% of remaining gross profit(1) for 2020, compared to 90.2% of remaining gross profit in 2019.\nNet income in 2020 increased 9.5%, or $5.5 million, to $63.2 million from $57.7 million in 2019. Adjusted EBITDA(1) increased $11.5 million, or 6.0%, to $202.2 million in 2020 from $190.7 million in 2019.\n________________________________________\n(1)Remaining gross profit margin, Adjusted EBITDA and operating expenses as a percentage of remaining gross profit are non-GAAP financial measures and should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d).

Net sales increased by $287.4 million, or 1.7%, to $16,957.9 million in 2020 from $16,670.5 million in 2019. The increase in net sales was driven primarily by strong cigarette sales, including increases in cigarette manufacturers' prices and growth in cigarette carton sales, partially offset by a decrease in food/non-food sales to existing customers and a net decrease in the number of stores serviced during the year. Sales of both cigarettes and food/non-food products in 2020 were impacted by changes in consumer buying habits as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nNet Sales of Cigarettes. Net sales of cigarettes in 2020 increased by $417.8 million, or 3.8%, to $11,310.5 million from $10,892.7 million in 2019. The increase in cigarette sales was driven primarily by a 3.6% increase in the average sales price per carton due to cigarette manufacturers' price increases and a 0.3% increase in carton sales. Cigarette carton sales increased by 0.2% and 0.7% in the U.S. and Canada, respectively, driven by a 2.3% increase in carton sales to existing customers, partially offset by a net decrease in the number of stores serviced during the year. Cigarette carton sales to existing customers in 2020 outperformed recent downward trends, due primarily to changes in consumer buying behavior as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe believe long-term cigarette consumption will be adversely impacted by rising prices, increases in excise taxes and other legislative actions, diminishing social acceptance, sales through illicit markets and increasing use of alternative nicotine products. We expect cigarette manufacturers will raise prices as carton sales decline in order to maintain or enhance their\noverall profitability, thus partially mitigating the effect of the declines to distributors. Historical industry data indicates that convenience retailers have more than offset cigarette profit declines through sales growth in food/non-food products.\nNet cigarette sales as a percentage of total net sales were 66.7% in 2020 compared to 65.3% in 2019. The increase in the percentage of net cigarette sales in 2020 was due primarily to changes in consumer buying behavior as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nNet Sales of Food/Non-food Products. Net sales of food/non-food products in 2020 decreased $130.4 million, or 2.3%, to $5,647.4 million from $5,777.8 million in 2019.\nThe following table provides net sales by product category for our food/non-food products (in millions, except percentages) (1):\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase (Decrease) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product Category </td> <td>Net Sales </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Sales </td> <td> </td> <td>Amounts </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Food </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,575.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,746.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(170.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.8) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fresh </td> <td>509.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>502.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Candy </td> <td>1,004.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,039.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(35.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.4) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OTP </td> <td>1,558.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,438.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>119.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Health, beauty & general ( HB&G\u201d) </td> <td>801.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>847.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(45.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.4) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Beverages </td> <td>197.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>202.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.4) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equipment/other </td> <td>1.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total food/non-food products\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,647.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,777.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(130.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.3) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________________________________________\n(1) Amounts and percentages have been rounded for presentation purposes and might differ from unrounded results.\nThe decrease in food/non-food sales in 2020 was driven primarily by a decrease in sales to existing customers and a net decrease in the number of stores serviced during the year due primarily to the changes in consumer buying behavior as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The largest sales declines were in the food, HB&G and candy categories, partially offset by growth in OTP sales to existing customers. Our HB&G category was also impacted by a decline in sales of alternative nicotine products, which was impacted by both the changes in consumer buying behavior due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the enactment of regulations governing the sale of flavored product categories.\nTotal net sales of food/non-food products as a percentage of total net sales were 33.3% in 2020 compared to 34.7% in 2019.\nGross Profit. Gross profit represents profit after deducting cost of goods sold from net sales during the period. Inventory holding gains represent incremental revenues whereas vendor incentives, OTP tax refunds and changes in LIFO reserves are components of cost of goods sold. Gross profit in 2020 decreased $35.9 million, or 3.9%, to $888.3 million from $924.2 million in 2019, driven primarily by the overall shift in sales mix to cigarettes, which have lower margins than food/non-food products, and higher LIFO expense, partially offset by $1.9 million of incremental inventory holding gains.\nThe following table provides the components comprising the change in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for 2020 and 2019 (in millions, except percentages)(1):\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Increase (Decrease) in Gross Profit </td> <td> </td> <td>Amounts </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Net sales </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Net sales, less excise taxes </td> <td> </td> <td>Amounts </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Net sales </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Net sales, less excise taxes </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales </td> <td>$ </td> <td>287.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,957.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,670.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales, less excise taxes\n(non-GAAP)(2)\n</td> <td>287.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,617.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,329.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Components of gross profit: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cigarette inventory holding gains(3)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>8.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.19 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.23 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.14 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.17 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other inventory holding gains(4)\n</td> <td>(6.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.04 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.05 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LIFO expense(5)\n</td> <td>(3.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(30.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.18) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.23) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(27.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.17) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.21) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Remaining gross profit\n(non-GAAP)(6)\n</td> <td>(34.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>887.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.23 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.52 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>921.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.53 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.92 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>(35.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>888.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.24 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.52 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>924.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.54 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.93 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________________________________________\n(1) Amounts and percentages have been rounded for presentation purposes and might differ from unrounded results.\n(2) See the reconciliation of net sales, less excise taxes to net sales in Non-GAAP Financial Information.\u201d\n(3) In 2020, $29.8 million and $2.0 million of the cigarette inventory holding gains were attributable to the U.S. and Canada, respectively. In 2019, $21.3 million and $1.7 million of the cigarette inventory holding gains were attributable to the U.S. and Canada, respectively.\n(4) In 2019, all $6.9 million of candy inventory holding gains were attributable to the U.S.\n(5) The increase of $3.1 million in LIFO expense in 2020 was due primarily to an increase in the Producer Price Index ( PPI\u201d) for cigarettes and an increase in inventory levels (see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements).\n(6) Remaining gross profit is a non-GAAP financial measure, which we provide to segregate the effects of LIFO expense, cigarette inventory holding gains and other items that significantly affect the comparability of gross profit (see reconciliation of remaining gross profit to gross profit in Non-GAAP Financial Information.\u201d)\nGross profit margin decreased 30 basis points to 5.24% of total net sales during 2020 from 5.54% in 2019. The change in the sales mix between cigarettes and food/non-food contributed to approximately 47% of the gross profit margin decline. In addition, the decrease in gross profit margin for 2020 was driven primarily by an overall decline in food/non-food margins as a result of a shift in sales mix toward lower margin items, such as OTP, due primarily to changes in consumer buying habits as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, lower margins within the HB&G category, primarily in alternative nicotine products, also contributed to the decline in overall food/non-food gross profit margin.\nDistributors such as Core-Mark may, from time to time, earn higher gross profits on inventory and excise tax stamp quantities on hand at the time manufacturers increase their prices or when states, localities or provinces increase their excise taxes. Such increases are reflected in customer pricing for all subsequent sales, including sales of inventory on hand at the time of the increase. The resulting higher gross profits are referred to as inventory holding gains. In 2020, we had $1.9 million higher inventory holding gains compared to 2019. Cigarette inventory holding gains, which were impacted by the timing and amount of cigarette manufacturers' price increases, increased $8.8 million in 2020, offset by $6.9 million in inventory holding gains related to a candy price increase in 2019. Historically, significant price increases from candy manufacturers have only occurred every three to four years.\nWe expect cigarette manufacturers will continue to raise prices as carton sales decline in order to maintain or enhance their overall profitability and the various taxing jurisdictions will raise excise taxes to make up for lost tax dollars related to consumption declines.\nLIFO expense was $30.7 million in 2020 compared to $27.6 million in 2019. Since we value our inventory in the U.S. on a LIFO basis, our gross profit can be positively or negatively impacted depending on the relative level of price inflation or\ndeflation in manufacturer prices as reported in the Bureau of Labor Statistics PPI used to estimate and record our book LIFO expense (see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements).\nRemaining gross profit, a non-GAAP financial measure (see reconciliation of remaining gross profit to gross profit in Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d), decreased $34.7 million, or 3.8%, to $887.2 million in 2020 from $921.9 million in 2019. Remaining gross profit margin, a non-GAAP financial measure (see reconciliation of remaining gross profit margin, as well as an explanation of its significance, in Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d) decreased to 5.23% in 2020 compared to 5.53% in 2019, driven primarily by the impact of a shift in sales mix towards lower margin cigarettes, a shift in the sales mix within food/non-food towards lower margin categories and lower margins within the HB&G category, primarily in alternative nicotine products.\nCigarette remaining gross profit, a non-GAAP financial measure (see reconciliation of cigarette remaining gross profit to cigarette gross profit in Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d), increased $7.3 million, or 3.4%, to $220.9 million in 2020 from $213.6 million for the same period in 2019. The increase in cigarette remaining gross profit was driven primarily by a 3.1% increase in remaining gross profit per carton and a 0.3% increase in cigarette carton sales.\nFood/non-food remaining gross profit, a non-GAAP financial measure (see reconciliation of food/non-food remaining gross profit to food/non-food gross profit in Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d), decreased $42.0 million or 5.9% to $666.3 million, in 2020 from $708.3 million in 2019. Food/non-food remaining gross profit margin, a non-GAAP financial measure (see reconciliation of food/non-food remaining gross profit margin in Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d), decreased to 11.80% in 2020 from 12.26% in 2019, driven primarily by a decrease in sales in certain higher margin categories including food and HB&G, an increase in sales in our lower margin OTP category, and a decline in margin rate, primarily in alternative nicotine products within the HB&G category.\nIn 2020, our remaining gross profit for food/non-food products was 75.1% of our total remaining gross profit compared to 76.8% for 2019.\nOperating Expenses. Our operating expenses include costs related to warehousing and distribution, SG&A expenses and amortization of intangible assets. In 2020, operating expenses decreased by $38.0 million, or 4.6%, to $793.6 million from $831.6 million in 2019. The decrease was driven primarily by increased productivity and cost savings initiatives implemented mainly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a percentage of total net sales, operating expenses were 4.7% in 2020 compared to 5.0% in 2019. Operating expenses were 89.4% of remaining gross profit, a non-GAAP financial ratio (see reconciliation of operating expenses as a percentage of remaining gross profit, as well as an explanation of its significance, in Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d) in 2020, compared to 90.2% of remaining gross profit in 2019. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of remaining gross profit was due primarily to operating expense reductions that more than offset the decline in remaining gross profit.\nWarehousing and Distribution Expenses. Warehousing and distribution expenses decreased $24.5 million, or 4.3%, to $541.7 million in 2020 from $566.2 million in 2019. The decrease in warehousing and distribution expenses was due primarily to cost reductions, an increase in productivity and fewer deliveries. Warehousing and distribution expenses were 3.2% of total net sales in 2020 compared to 3.4% of total net sales in 2019. Warehousing and distribution expenses were 61.1% of remaining gross profit, a non-GAAP financial ratio (see reconciliation of operating expenses as a percentage of remaining gross profit, as well as an explanation of its significance, in Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d), in 2020, compared to 61.4% of remaining gross profit in 2019.\nSelling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d) Expenses. SG&A expenses decreased $13.2 million, or 5.2%, to $242.2 million in 2020 from $255.4 million in 2019. The reduction in SG&A expenses was due primarily to cost savings initiatives. SG&A expenses for 2019 included $2.3 million of incremental costs related to the relocation of our headquarters. SG&A expenses were 1.4% of total net sales in 2020 compared to 1.5% of total net sales in 2019. SG&A was 27.3% of remaining gross profit, a non-GAAP financial ratio (see reconciliation of operating expenses as a percentage of remaining gross profit, as well as an explanation of its significance, in Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d), in 2020, compared to 27.7% of remaining gross profit in 2019.\nAmortization Expense. Amortization expense decreased $0.3 million, or 3.0%, to $9.7 million in 2020 from $10.0 million in 2019.\nInterest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net decreased $3.9 million, or 27.1%, to $10.5 million in 2020 compared to $14.4 million in 2019. Interest expense, net, includes interest, amortization of loan origination costs related to borrowings and facility fees and interest on finance lease obligations. The decrease in net interest expense was due primarily to a decrease in the average borrowing rate and lower average borrowings. Average borrowings in 2020 were $259.5 million with a weighted-average interest rate of 1.8% compared to average borrowings of $303.2 million and a weighted-average interest rate of 3.4% in 2019.\nForeign Currency Transaction Losses, Net. We recognized a foreign currency transaction loss of $0.9 million in 2020 compared to a loss of $0.8 million in 2019. During times of a strengthening U.S. dollar, we generally record foreign currency losses from our Canadian operations. Conversely, during times of a weakening U.S. dollar, we generally record foreign currency gains.\nIncome Taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our effective tax rate was a provision of 24.1% in 2020 compared to a provision of 25.5% in 2019.\nAdjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure (see reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income in Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d), increased $11.5 million, or 6.0%, to $202.2 million in 2020 from $190.7 million for the same period in 2019. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was driven primarily by higher operating income in 2020 attained through cost leverage and an increase in inventory holding gains.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nThe financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Core-Mark uses certain non-GAAP financial measures including (i) Adjusted EBITDA, (ii) net sales, less excise taxes, (iii) remaining gross profit (including cigarette remaining gross profit and food/non-food remaining gross profit), (iv) remaining gross profit margin (including cigarette remaining gross profit margin and food/non-food remaining gross profit margin), (v) remaining gross profit margin less excise taxes (including cigarette remaining gross profit margin less excise taxes and food/non-food remaining gross profit margin less excise taxes), (vi) cigarette remaining gross profit per carton and (vii) operating expenses (and the components thereof) as a percentage of remaining gross profit. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information for investors regarding the performance of our business and facilitate a meaningful period to period evaluation. We also believe these measures allow investors to view results in a manner similar to the method used by our management. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in order to have comparable financial results to analyze changes in our underlying business. These non-GAAP measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be defined differently than other companies and therefore, such measures used by other companies may not be comparable to ours. We strongly encourage investors and stockholders to review our financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. These non-GAAP measures are defined as follows:\n(i) Adjusted EBITDA is a measure used by management to measure operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is equal to net income adding back net interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, LIFO expense, stock-based compensation expense, net foreign currency transaction gains or losses. See the table below for additional details on the components of Adjusted EBITDA. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is one of the primary measures used externally by our investors, analysts and peers in our industry for purposes of valuation and comparing our results to other companies.\n(ii) Net sales less excise taxes is a non-GAAP financial measure which we provide to separate the increase in sales and gross profits due to product sales growth and increases in state, local and provincial excise taxes, which we are responsible for collecting and remitting. Federal excise taxes are levied on the manufacturers who pass the tax on to us as part of the product cost and thus are not a component of our excise taxes. Although increases in cigarette taxes result in higher net sales, our overall gross profit percentage may be reduced.\n(iii) Remaining gross profit (including cigarette remaining gross profit and food/non-food remaining gross profit), (iv) remaining gross profit margin (including cigarette remaining gross profit margin and food/non-food remaining gross profit margin), (v) remaining gross profit margin less excise taxes (including cigarette remaining gross profit margin less excise taxes and food/non-food remaining gross profit margin less excise taxes), and (vi) cigarette remaining gross profit per carton, are non-GAAP financial measures, which we provide to segregate the effects of LIFO expense, cigarette holding gains and certain other items that significantly affect the comparability of gross profit.\n(vii) Operating expenses (and the components thereof) as a percentage of remaining gross profit is a non-GAAP financial measure, which is used by management to measure operating leverage. Although management also uses operating expenses as a percentage of net sales, this metric may be impacted on a comparable basis by, among other items, excise taxes, changes in manufacturers' prices (including inflation), and our continuing trend in sales mix shift from cigarettes to higher-margin food/non-food items which have substantially lower selling prices.\nThe following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to net income, as net income is the most comparable financial measure under U.S. GAAP (in millions):\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

appropriate tax authorities. Federal excise taxes are levied on the manufacturers who pass the tax on to us as part of the product cost and thus are not a component of our excise taxes. Although increases in cigarette excise taxes result in higher net sales, our overall gross profit percentage may be reduced since gross profit dollars generally remain the same.\n(3) Cigarette gross profit includes (i) cigarette inventory holding gains related to manufacturers' price increases, (ii) increases in state, local and provincial excise taxes and (iii) LIFO effects. Cigarette inventory holding gains for the years 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $31.8 million, $23.0 million and $19.6 million, respectively. For 2018, we recognized cigarette tax stamp inventory holding gains, in the U.S. of $7.4 million.\n(4) Food/non-food gross profit includes (i) inventory holding gains related to manufacturers' price increases, (ii) increases in state, local and provincial excise taxes, and (iii) LIFO effects.\n(5) In 2019, we recognized $6.9 million of candy inventory holding gains attributable to the U.S. In 2018, other inventory holding gains consisted of $7.4 million cigarette tax stamp inventory holding gains attributable to the U.S.\nThe following table provides operating expenses as a percentage of remaining gross profit (in millions, except percentages)(1):\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>888.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>924.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>867.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cigarette inventory holding gains(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(31.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(23.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(19.6) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other inventory holding gains(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.4) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LIFO expense </td> <td> </td> <td>30.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Remaining gross profit (non-GAAP) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>887.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>921.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>865.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Warehousing and distribution expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>541.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>566.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>540.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>242.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>255.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>245.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangible assets </td> <td> </td> <td>9.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>793.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>831.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>795.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Warehouse and distribution expense as a percentage of remaining gross profit (non-GAAP)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>61.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>61.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>62.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of remaining gross profit (non-GAAP)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>27.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>27.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>28.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangible assets as a percentage of remaining gross profit (non-GAAP)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expense as a percentage of remaining gross profit (non-GAAP)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>89.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>90.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>91.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________________________________________\n(1) Amounts and percentages have been rounded for presentation purposes and may differ from unrounded results.\n(2) For the year ended December 31, 2020, $29.8 million and $2.0 million of the cigarette inventory holding gains were attributable to the U.S. and Canada, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2019, $21.3 million and $1.7 million of the cigarette holding gains were attributable to the U.S. and Canada, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2018, $17.3 million and $2.3 million of the cigarette holding gains were attributable to the U.S. and Canada, respectively.\n(3) For the year ended December 31, 2019, $6.9 million of the other inventory holding gains consisted of candy inventory holding gains attributable to the U.S. For the year ended December 31, 2018, $7.4 million of the other inventory holding gains consisted of cigarette tax stamp inventory holding gains attributable to the U.S.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur cash and cash equivalents were $22.8 million and $14.1 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOur liquidity requirements arise primarily from our working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements for our revolving credit facility ( Credit Facility\u201d), income taxes, repurchases of common stock and dividend payments. We have historically funded our liquidity requirements through our cash flows from operations and external borrowings. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our cash flows provided by operating activities were $147.8 million. Subject to borrowing base limitations, we had $402.4 million of borrowing capacity available under our Credit Facility, excluding the expansion feature of $200.0 million, as of December 31, 2020.\nWe are potentially exposed to increased credit risk as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. While the vast majority of our customers are convenience retailers that continue to operate as essential businesses, our customers include smaller independent convenience retailers that may face liquidity constraints as a result of reduced store traffic. Our customers also include non-convenience store formats including hotel gift shops, casinos, tobacco shops, schools, airport concessions and other specialty and small format stores that carry convenience products. Some of these customers may have temporarily ceased, or significantly reduced, operations due to government-imposed restrictions, while others have seen a material decline in store traffic.\nWe have taken actions to help preserve liquidity, including reducing operating costs to better align with the current sales volume trends and closely managing our accounts receivable and capital expenditures.\nGiven our financial strength coming into the pandemic and ample availability of capital, we expect to be able to maintain adequate liquidity through the current environment, subject to the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nOur cash flows from operating activities provided net cash of $147.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to net cash provided of $89.7 million for the same period in 2019, an increase of $58.1 million. The increase was primarily attributable to changes in working capital, which was a cash use of $16.2 million or $54.0 million lower than the comparative period, and an increase in Adjusted EBITDA (see reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income in Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d).\nOur cash flows from operating activities were impacted by the following movements in working capital (in millions):\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts receivable, net </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other receivables, net </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.8) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventories, net </td> <td> </td> <td>(119.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(114.8) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deposits, prepayments and other non-current assets </td> <td> </td> <td>20.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(42.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts payable </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cigarette and tobacco taxes payable </td> <td> </td> <td>21.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(20.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension, claims, accrued and other long-term liabilities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>39.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(16.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(70.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWorking capital contributions used cash of $16.2 million for 2020, compared to cash used of $70.2 million for 2019. These contributions for the comparative periods were impacted by, among other items, an increase of inventory levels and cigarette and tobacco taxes payable, partially offset by a decrease of deposits, prepayments and other non-current assets due primarily to the timing of prepayments to cigarette vendors.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nOur investing activities used net cash of $29.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $31.0 million for the same period in 2019, a decrease in cash use of $1.4 million. Capitalization of software and related development costs were $3.5 million for 2020 compared to $6.0 million for 2019. Additions to property and equipment were $27.2 million for 2020 compared to $22.8 million for the same period in 2019, an increase in cash use of $4.4 million. We expect capital expenditures for 2021 to be approximately $45 million, which will be utilized primarily for maintenance and technology initiatives, as well as upgrades to certain distribution facilities and the relocation of one distribution facility.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nOur financing activities used net cash of $107.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $71.2 million of net cash used for the same period in 2019, a change of $36.7 million. Net repayments under our Credit Facility during the year ended December 31, 2020, were $66.8 million compared to net borrowings of $4.8 million in 2019. Book overdrafts increased $7.2 million, caused by the level of cash on hand in relation to the timing of accounts payable and vendor prepayments. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased $10.4 million of our common stock under the 2020 Program, compared to repurchases of $22.0 million in 2019 under the Prior Program.\nOur Credit Facility\nWe have a Credit Facility with a borrowing capacity of $750 million as of December 31, 2020, limited by a borrowing base consisting of eligible accounts receivable and inventories. The Credit Facility expires in February 2026 and has an expansion feature which permits an increase up to an additional $200 million, subject to borrowing base requirements. All obligations under the Credit Facility are secured by first-priority liens on substantially all of our present and future assets. The terms of the Credit Facility permit prepayment without penalty at any time (subject to customary breakage costs with respect to the London Interbank Offer Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) or Canadian Dollar Offer Rate based loans prepaid prior to the end of an interest period). The Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and restrictive covenants. In addition, the Credit Facility allows for unlimited stock repurchases and dividends as long as we meet certain credit availability percentages and fixed charge coverage ratios. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the Credit Facility.

See Our Credit Facility above.\n(2) Our purchase obligations at December 31, 2020 were related primarily to purchases of compressed natural gas for our trucking fleet, delivery and warehouse equipment, computer software and services, and leasehold improvements (see Note 9 - Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements).\n(3) The majority of our sales offices, warehouse facilities and trucks are subject to lease agreements which expire at various dates through 2037, excluding renewal options. We are generally required to incur maintenance, insurance and property tax expenses in connection with our lease agreements. In most instances, we expect the leases that expire will be renewed or replaced in the normal course of our business.\n(4) Represents net future minimum lease payments for warehouse facilities and other office, vehicle and warehouse equipment. Current maturities of finance leases are included in accrued liabilities and non-current maturities are included in long-term debt. Interest costs associated with the finance leases are included in the table above.\n(5) We have not included in the table above gross claims liabilities of $60.7 million, which includes workers' compensation, health and welfare, and general and auto liabilities because they do not have a definite payout by year. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Claims Liabilities and Insurance Recoverables. See also Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nLetters of Credit. As of December 31, 2020, our standby letters of credit issued under our Credit Facility were $19.5 million and related primarily to casualty insurance. The majority of the standby letters of credit mature in one year. However, in the ordinary course of our business, we will continue to renew or modify the terms of the letters of credit to support business requirements. The liabilities underlying the letters of credit are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of our Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. The critical accounting polices used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments with regards to estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We believe the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our financial statements are appropriate; however, actual results could differ from these estimates.\nWe consider the allowance for credit losses, claims liabilities and insurance recoverables and valuation of long-lived assets and goodwill to be those estimates which involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. We believe that the following represent the more critical accounting policies, which are subject to estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been increased uncertainty and disruption in the global economy and financial markets. We are not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require updates to our estimates or judgments or require us to revise the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of December 31, 2020.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses we estimate will arise from our trade customers' inability to make required payments. We evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable and determine the appropriate allowance for credit losses based on historical experience, economic conditions and a review of specific customer accounts. In determining the adequacy of allowances for customer receivables, we analyze factors such as the value of any collateral, customer financial statements, historical collection experience, aging of receivables, general economic conditions and other factors. It is possible that the accuracy of the estimation process could be materially affected by different judgments as to the collectability based on information considered and further deterioration of accounts. If circumstances change (i.e., further evidence of material adverse creditworthiness, additional accounts become credit risks, store closures or deterioration in general economic conditions), our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount.\nThe allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2020 and 2019 amounted to 4.3% and 3.5%, respectively, of gross trade accounts receivable.\nCredit loss expense associated with our trade customer receivables was $7.6 million and $7.1 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. As a percentage of net sales, our credit loss expense was less than 0.1% for each of 2020 and 2019.\nClaims Liabilities and Insurance Recoverables\nWe maintain reserves related to workers' compensation, auto and general liability and health and welfare programs that are principally self-insured. Our workers' compensation, auto and general liability insurance policies currently include a deductible of $500,000 per occurrence and we maintain excess loss insurance that covers any health and welfare costs in excess of $400,000 per person per year.\nOur reserves for workers' compensation, auto and general insurance liabilities are estimated based on applying an actuarially derived loss development factor to our incurred losses, including losses for claims incurred but not yet reported.\nActuarial projections of losses concerning workers' compensation, auto and general insurance liabilities are subject to a high degree of variability. Among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting future inflation rates, health care costs, litigation trends, legal interpretations, legislative reforms, benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns. Our reserve for health and welfare claims includes an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported, which is derived primarily from historical experience.\nOur claim liabilities and the related recoverables from insurance carriers for estimated claims in excess of the deductible and other insured events are presented in their gross amounts because there is no right of offset. The following is a summary of our net reserves (in millions):\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Current </td> <td> </td> <td>Long-Term </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Current </td> <td> </td> <td>Long-Term </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross claims liabilities: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Workers' compensation\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>9.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Auto and general insurance\n</td> <td>7.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Health and welfare\n</td> <td>5.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total gross claims liabilities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>56.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance recoverables </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(15.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(19.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(14.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(17.5) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reserves, net: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Workers' compensation\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>8.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Auto and general insurance\n</td> <td>4.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Health and welfare\n</td> <td>5.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reserves, net </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in these reserves for 2020 was due primarily to new claims in 2020 as well as growth of older claims for our workers compensation, auto and general insurance. A 10% change in our incurred but not reported estimates would increase or decrease the estimated reserves for our workers' compensation, auto and general insurance, and health and welfare liabilities by $1.4 million, $0.5 million and $0.4 million as of December 31, 2020, respectively.\nValuation of Long-lived Assets\nWe review our long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable. Long-lived assets consist primarily of land, buildings, delivery, warehouse and office equipment, leasehold improvements and intangible assets with definite useful lives. An impairment of long-lived assets exists when the carrying amount of a long-lived asset, or asset group, exceeds its fair value. Impairment losses are recorded when the carrying amount of the impaired asset is not recoverable. Recoverability is determined by comparing the carrying amount of the asset (or asset group) to the undiscounted cash flows which are expected to be generated from its use. Our estimates of future cash flows are based on historical experience and management's expectations of relevant customers and markets and other operational factors. These estimates project future cash flows several years into the future and can be affected by factors such as competition, inflation and other economic conditions. We have assessed our asset groups and determined we have six asset groups. The determination of asset groups primarily considers revenue inter-dependencies related to larger chain customer agreements which are serviced by multiple distribution centers. We did not record impairment losses related to long-lived assets in any of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nValuation of Goodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Goodwill is not subject to amortization but must be evaluated for impairment. We test goodwill for impairment annually as of October 1, or whenever events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount. Our reporting units, which are the U.S. and Canada, also represent our operating segments. Whenever events or circumstances change, we assess the related qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The tests to evaluate goodwill for impairment are performed at the reporting unit level. In the quantitative impairment test, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, such excess represents the amount of goodwill impairment for which an impairment loss would be recorded. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and\nassumptions. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit is based on the discounted cash flow method, which is based on historical and forecasted amounts specific to each reporting unit and considers sales, gross profit, operating profit and cash flows and general economic and market conditions, as well as the impact of planned business and operational strategies and other estimates and assumptions for future growth rates, working capital and capital expenditures. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time, but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty. We did not record any impairment charges related to goodwill during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nIn connection with our annual goodwill impairment testing performed during 2020, the quantitative test indicated that the fair values of the applicable reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying values, and accordingly, no further testing of goodwill was required. However, changes in the judgments and estimates underlying our analysis of goodwill for possible impairment, including expected future cash flows and discount rate, could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of the reporting units in the future and could result in impairment of goodwill.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that are included under Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K. Also refer to Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d which is included after the Table of Contents in this Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis also includes non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide important perspective in understanding trends that may impact our business. These non-GAAP financial measures are discussed, including reconciliation of these measures to GAAP, under Non-GAAP Financial Information.\u201d\nThis section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. Discussions of 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 are not included in this Form 10-K and can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 2, 2020.\nOur Business\nCore-Mark is one of the largest marketers of fresh, food and broad-line supply solutions to the convenience retail industry in North America. We offer a full range of products, marketing programs and technology solutions to approximately 40,000 customer locations in the U.S. and Canada. Our customers include traditional convenience stores, drug stores, mass merchants, grocery stores, liquor stores, and other specialty and small format stores that carry convenience products. Our product offering includes cigarettes, other tobacco products ( OTP\u201d), alternative nicotine products, candy, snacks, food, including fresh products, groceries, dairy, bread, beverages, general merchandise and health and beauty care products. We operate a network of 32 distribution centers in the U.S. and Canada (excluding two distribution facilities we operate as a third-party logistics provider).\nBusiness Strategy Overview\nCore-Mark's mission is to be the most valued marketer of fresh, food and broad-line supply solutions to the convenience retail industry. Consistent with this mission, our strategic framework is centered around three key initiatives: growing sales and margins faster than the industry, providing industry-leading category management solutions and leveraging our cost structure. The convenience wholesale and retail industry remains highly fragmented, supporting significant opportunities for both organic growth and growth through strategic acquisitions. Core-Mark is one of the largest wholesale distributors to the convenience retail industry in North America, one of two national convenience distributors in the U.S. and the largest in Canada, and represents an estimated 7% market share of the in-store sales of convenience stores in North America.\nOur growth initiatives include elevating same store sales, gaining share of North American convenience stores and being opportunistic with traditional and industry-adjacent acquisition opportunities. While serving traditional convenience retailers remains the primary driver for our business, we serve a wide variety of alternative convenience retail formats including mass merchandisers, casinos, colleges and airports. Driving growth through these alternative convenience retail formats and channels is a core component of our strategy and we see significant opportunities to drive growth organically, through acquisitions and strategic partnerships. Our focus on providing industry-leading category management solutions to our customers positions us to partner with retailers to help increase their sales and profits. We offer a wide array of marketing programs, innovative product alternatives, data aggregation and loyalty solutions to our customers in pursuit of category management excellence. Core-Mark is also actively engaged in efforts to increase the leverage of our operating cost structure through a range of initiatives, including technology investments, centralizing transactional processes and employee engagement aimed at increasing productivity.\nWe believe consistent execution on the aforementioned strategic priorities will position Core-Mark as the leader in convenience retail distribution and provides a strong pathway to achieve sustainable shareholder returns.\nOther Business Developments\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on our operating results during the year ended December 31, 2020, and we expect the pandemic will continue to affect our business for some period of time. While the vast majority of our customers are convenience retailers that continue to operate as essential businesses, the unprecedented impact of the COVID-19 pandemic since the second quarter of 2020, including shelter-in-place orders by states, provinces, cities and counties resulted in a significant downturn in miles driven, resulting in a decline in convenience retail store visits across North America. Although we are seeing recovery as consumer purchase trends improve, we expect future results to continue to be impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDividends\nThe Board of Directors approved the following cash dividends in 2020 (in millions, except per share data):\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Declaration Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Dividend Per Share </td> <td> </td> <td>Record Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Cash Payment Amount(1)(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Payment Date </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>February 24, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.12 </td> <td> </td> <td>March 16, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$5.5 </td> <td> </td> <td>March 27, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>May 7, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.12 </td> <td> </td> <td>May 22, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$5.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>June 19, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>August 6, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.12 </td> <td> </td> <td>August 21, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$5.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>September 18, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>November 5, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.13 </td> <td> </td> <td>November 20, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$5.7 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 18, 2020 </td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________________________________________\n(1) Includes cash payments on declared dividends and payments made on time-based restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d) and performance share awards that vested subsequent to the payment date.\n(2) Amounts have been rounded for presentation purposes and may differ from unrounded amounts.\nWe paid dividends of $22.0 million and $20.8 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn February 24, 2020, our Board of Directors authorized a $60.0 million stock repurchase program (the 2020 Program\u201d), replacing our prior stock repurchase program (the Prior Program\u201d). At the time of approval, we had funds totaling $0.4 million remaining under the Prior Program which were subsequently retired unused. The timing, price and volume of purchases under the 2020 Program are based on market conditions, cash and liquidity requirements, relevant securities laws and other factors. The 2020 Program may be discontinued or amended at any time. The 2020 Program has no expiration date and terminates when the amount authorized has been expended or the Board of Directors withdraws its authorization.\nIn 2020, all stock repurchases were made under the 2020 Program, and we repurchased 407,971 shares of common stock for a total cost of $10.4 million, or an average price of $25.62 per share. As of December 31, 2020, $49.6 million remained available for future share repurchases under the 2020 Program. In 2019, under the Prior Program, we repurchased 767,681 shares of common stock for a total cost of $22.0 million, or an average price of $28.66 per share.\nOverview of 2020 Results\nDuring 2020, we continued to build on our sales and operational capabilities, as well as our financial foundation, to drive our long-term growth strategy. We delivered strong financial results and further enhanced our industry-leading offering of products and services despite the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur net sales in 2020 increased 1.7%, or $287.4 million, to $16,957.9 million compared to $16,670.5 million for 2019. The increase in net sales for the year was driven primarily by strong cigarette sales, including increases in cigarette manufacturers' prices and growth in cigarette carton sales, partially offset by a 2.3% decrease in sales of food/non-food. Sales of cigarettes and food/non-food products for the year were impacted by changes in consumer buying habits as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nGross profit in 2020 decreased $35.9 million, or 3.9%, to $888.3 million from $924.2 million in 2019, driven primarily by a shift in overall sales mix to cigarettes, which have lower margins compared with food/non-food products, and higher LIFO expense, partially offset by $1.9 million of incremental net inventory holding gains.\nGross profit margin was 5.24% of total net sales for 2020 compared to 5.54% in 2019. Remaining gross profit margin(1) decreased to 5.23% for 2020 from 5.53% in 2019. The decline in remaining gross profit margin was driven primarily by the change in the sales mix between cigarettes and food/non-food and a decline in margins within the food/non-food category resulting from a shift in sales mix and lower gross profit margins in certain categories. We expect our gross profit margin to continue to be impacted by both sales mix and lower margins in certain product categories for some period of time as a direct result of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOperating expenses in 2020 decreased 4.6%, or $38.0 million, to $793.6 million from $831.6 million in 2019. The decrease was driven primarily by increased productivity and cost savings initiatives, implemented mainly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As outlined in our press release on April 14, 2020, we took steps during the second quarter to reduce operating costs to better align them with sales volume trends and to preserve liquidity. We also achieved cost savings through actions to reduce other non-essential costs including travel, meetings and events and other discretionary expenditures. Operating expenses were 4.7% of total net sales for 2020 compared to 5.0% in 2019. Operating expenses were 89.4% of remaining gross profit(1) for 2020, compared to 90.2% of remaining gross profit in 2019.\nNet income in 2020 increased 9.5%, or $5.5 million, to $63.2 million from $57.7 million in 2019. Adjusted EBITDA(1) increased $11.5 million, or 6.0%, to $202.2 million in 2020 from $190.7 million in 2019.\n________________________________________\n(1)Remaining gross profit margin, Adjusted EBITDA and operating expenses as a percentage of remaining gross profit are non-GAAP financial measures and should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d).

Net sales increased by $287.4 million, or 1.7%, to $16,957.9 million in 2020 from $16,670.5 million in 2019. The increase in net sales was driven primarily by strong cigarette sales, including increases in cigarette manufacturers' prices and growth in cigarette carton sales, partially offset by a decrease in food/non-food sales to existing customers and a net decrease in the number of stores serviced during the year. Sales of both cigarettes and food/non-food products in 2020 were impacted by changes in consumer buying habits as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nNet Sales of Cigarettes. Net sales of cigarettes in 2020 increased by $417.8 million, or 3.8%, to $11,310.5 million from $10,892.7 million in 2019. The increase in cigarette sales was driven primarily by a 3.6% increase in the average sales price per carton due to cigarette manufacturers' price increases and a 0.3% increase in carton sales. Cigarette carton sales increased by 0.2% and 0.7% in the U.S. and Canada, respectively, driven by a 2.3% increase in carton sales to existing customers, partially offset by a net decrease in the number of stores serviced during the year. Cigarette carton sales to existing customers in 2020 outperformed recent downward trends, due primarily to changes in consumer buying behavior as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe believe long-term cigarette consumption will be adversely impacted by rising prices, increases in excise taxes and other legislative actions, diminishing social acceptance, sales through illicit markets and increasing use of alternative nicotine products. We expect cigarette manufacturers will raise prices as carton sales decline in order to maintain or enhance their\noverall profitability, thus partially mitigating the effect of the declines to distributors. Historical industry data indicates that convenience retailers have more than offset cigarette profit declines through sales growth in food/non-food products.\nNet cigarette sales as a percentage of total net sales were 66.7% in 2020 compared to 65.3% in 2019. The increase in the percentage of net cigarette sales in 2020 was due primarily to changes in consumer buying behavior as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nNet Sales of Food/Non-food Products. Net sales of food/non-food products in 2020 decreased $130.4 million, or 2.3%, to $5,647.4 million from $5,777.8 million in 2019.\nThe following table provides net sales by product category for our food/non-food products (in millions, except percentages) (1):\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase (Decrease) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product Category </td> <td>Net Sales </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Sales </td> <td> </td> <td>Amounts </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Food </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,575.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,746.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(170.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.8) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fresh </td> <td>509.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>502.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Candy </td> <td>1,004.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,039.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(35.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.4) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OTP </td> <td>1,558.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,438.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>119.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Health, beauty & general ( HB&G\u201d) </td> <td>801.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>847.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(45.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.4) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Beverages </td> <td>197.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>202.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.4) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equipment/other </td> <td>1.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total food/non-food products\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,647.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,777.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(130.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.3) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________________________________________\n(1) Amounts and percentages have been rounded for presentation purposes and might differ from unrounded results.\nThe decrease in food/non-food sales in 2020 was driven primarily by a decrease in sales to existing customers and a net decrease in the number of stores serviced during the year due primarily to the changes in consumer buying behavior as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The largest sales declines were in the food, HB&G and candy categories, partially offset by growth in OTP sales to existing customers. Our HB&G category was also impacted by a decline in sales of alternative nicotine products, which was impacted by both the changes in consumer buying behavior due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the enactment of regulations governing the sale of flavored product categories.\nTotal net sales of food/non-food products as a percentage of total net sales were 33.3% in 2020 compared to 34.7% in 2019.\nGross Profit. Gross profit represents profit after deducting cost of goods sold from net sales during the period. Inventory holding gains represent incremental revenues whereas vendor incentives, OTP tax refunds and changes in LIFO reserves are components of cost of goods sold. Gross profit in 2020 decreased $35.9 million, or 3.9%, to $888.3 million from $924.2 million in 2019, driven primarily by the overall shift in sales mix to cigarettes, which have lower margins than food/non-food products, and higher LIFO expense, partially offset by $1.9 million of incremental inventory holding gains.\nThe following table provides the components comprising the change in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for 2020 and 2019 (in millions, except percentages)(1):\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Increase (Decrease) in Gross Profit </td> <td> </td> <td>Amounts </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Net sales </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Net sales, less excise taxes </td> <td> </td> <td>Amounts </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Net sales </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Net sales, less excise taxes </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales </td> <td>$ </td> <td>287.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,957.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,670.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales, less excise taxes\n(non-GAAP)(2)\n</td> <td>287.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,617.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,329.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Components of gross profit: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cigarette inventory holding gains(3)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>8.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.19 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.23 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.14 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.17 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other inventory holding gains(4)\n</td> <td>(6.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.04 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.05 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LIFO expense(5)\n</td> <td>(3.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(30.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.18) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.23) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(27.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.17) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.21) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Remaining gross profit\n(non-GAAP)(6)\n</td> <td>(34.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>887.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.23 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.52 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>921.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.53 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.92 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>(35.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>888.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.24 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.52 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>924.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.54 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.93 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________________________________________\n(1) Amounts and percentages have been rounded for presentation purposes and might differ from unrounded results.\n(2) See the reconciliation of net sales, less excise taxes to net sales in Non-GAAP Financial Information.\u201d\n(3) In 2020, $29.8 million and $2.0 million of the cigarette inventory holding gains were attributable to the U.S. and Canada, respectively. In 2019, $21.3 million and $1.7 million of the cigarette inventory holding gains were attributable to the U.S. and Canada, respectively.\n(4) In 2019, all $6.9 million of candy inventory holding gains were attributable to the U.S.\n(5) The increase of $3.1 million in LIFO expense in 2020 was due primarily to an increase in the Producer Price Index ( PPI\u201d) for cigarettes and an increase in inventory levels (see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements).\n(6) Remaining gross profit is a non-GAAP financial measure, which we provide to segregate the effects of LIFO expense, cigarette inventory holding gains and other items that significantly affect the comparability of gross profit (see reconciliation of remaining gross profit to gross profit in Non-GAAP Financial Information.\u201d)\nGross profit margin decreased 30 basis points to 5.24% of total net sales during 2020 from 5.54% in 2019. The change in the sales mix between cigarettes and food/non-food contributed to approximately 47% of the gross profit margin decline. In addition, the decrease in gross profit margin for 2020 was driven primarily by an overall decline in food/non-food margins as a result of a shift in sales mix toward lower margin items, such as OTP, due primarily to changes in consumer buying habits as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, lower margins within the HB&G category, primarily in alternative nicotine products, also contributed to the decline in overall food/non-food gross profit margin.\nDistributors such as Core-Mark may, from time to time, earn higher gross profits on inventory and excise tax stamp quantities on hand at the time manufacturers increase their prices or when states, localities or provinces increase their excise taxes. Such increases are reflected in customer pricing for all subsequent sales, including sales of inventory on hand at the time of the increase. The resulting higher gross profits are referred to as inventory holding gains. In 2020, we had $1.9 million higher inventory holding gains compared to 2019. Cigarette inventory holding gains, which were impacted by the timing and amount of cigarette manufacturers' price increases, increased $8.8 million in 2020, offset by $6.9 million in inventory holding gains related to a candy price increase in 2019. Historically, significant price increases from candy manufacturers have only occurred every three to four years.\nWe expect cigarette manufacturers will continue to raise prices as carton sales decline in order to maintain or enhance their overall profitability and the various taxing jurisdictions will raise excise taxes to make up for lost tax dollars related to consumption declines.\nLIFO expense was $30.7 million in 2020 compared to $27.6 million in 2019. Since we value our inventory in the U.S. on a LIFO basis, our gross profit can be positively or negatively impacted depending on the relative level of price inflation or\ndeflation in manufacturer prices as reported in the Bureau of Labor Statistics PPI used to estimate and record our book LIFO expense (see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements).\nRemaining gross profit, a non-GAAP financial measure (see reconciliation of remaining gross profit to gross profit in Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d), decreased $34.7 million, or 3.8%, to $887.2 million in 2020 from $921.9 million in 2019. Remaining gross profit margin, a non-GAAP financial measure (see reconciliation of remaining gross profit margin, as well as an explanation of its significance, in Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d) decreased to 5.23% in 2020 compared to 5.53% in 2019, driven primarily by the impact of a shift in sales mix towards lower margin cigarettes, a shift in the sales mix within food/non-food towards lower margin categories and lower margins within the HB&G category, primarily in alternative nicotine products.\nCigarette remaining gross profit, a non-GAAP financial measure (see reconciliation of cigarette remaining gross profit to cigarette gross profit in Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d), increased $7.3 million, or 3.4%, to $220.9 million in 2020 from $213.6 million for the same period in 2019. The increase in cigarette remaining gross profit was driven primarily by a 3.1% increase in remaining gross profit per carton and a 0.3% increase in cigarette carton sales.\nFood/non-food remaining gross profit, a non-GAAP financial measure (see reconciliation of food/non-food remaining gross profit to food/non-food gross profit in Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d), decreased $42.0 million or 5.9% to $666.3 million, in 2020 from $708.3 million in 2019. Food/non-food remaining gross profit margin, a non-GAAP financial measure (see reconciliation of food/non-food remaining gross profit margin in Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d), decreased to 11.80% in 2020 from 12.26% in 2019, driven primarily by a decrease in sales in certain higher margin categories including food and HB&G, an increase in sales in our lower margin OTP category, and a decline in margin rate, primarily in alternative nicotine products within the HB&G category.\nIn 2020, our remaining gross profit for food/non-food products was 75.1% of our total remaining gross profit compared to 76.8% for 2019.\nOperating Expenses. Our operating expenses include costs related to warehousing and distribution, SG&A expenses and amortization of intangible assets. In 2020, operating expenses decreased by $38.0 million, or 4.6%, to $793.6 million from $831.6 million in 2019. The decrease was driven primarily by increased productivity and cost savings initiatives implemented mainly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a percentage of total net sales, operating expenses were 4.7% in 2020 compared to 5.0% in 2019. Operating expenses were 89.4% of remaining gross profit, a non-GAAP financial ratio (see reconciliation of operating expenses as a percentage of remaining gross profit, as well as an explanation of its significance, in Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d) in 2020, compared to 90.2% of remaining gross profit in 2019. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of remaining gross profit was due primarily to operating expense reductions that more than offset the decline in remaining gross profit.\nWarehousing and Distribution Expenses. Warehousing and distribution expenses decreased $24.5 million, or 4.3%, to $541.7 million in 2020 from $566.2 million in 2019. The decrease in warehousing and distribution expenses was due primarily to cost reductions, an increase in productivity and fewer deliveries. Warehousing and distribution expenses were 3.2% of total net sales in 2020 compared to 3.4% of total net sales in 2019. Warehousing and distribution expenses were 61.1% of remaining gross profit, a non-GAAP financial ratio (see reconciliation of operating expenses as a percentage of remaining gross profit, as well as an explanation of its significance, in Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d), in 2020, compared to 61.4% of remaining gross profit in 2019.\nSelling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d) Expenses. SG&A expenses decreased $13.2 million, or 5.2%, to $242.2 million in 2020 from $255.4 million in 2019. The reduction in SG&A expenses was due primarily to cost savings initiatives. SG&A expenses for 2019 included $2.3 million of incremental costs related to the relocation of our headquarters. SG&A expenses were 1.4% of total net sales in 2020 compared to 1.5% of total net sales in 2019. SG&A was 27.3% of remaining gross profit, a non-GAAP financial ratio (see reconciliation of operating expenses as a percentage of remaining gross profit, as well as an explanation of its significance, in Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d), in 2020, compared to 27.7% of remaining gross profit in 2019.\nAmortization Expense. Amortization expense decreased $0.3 million, or 3.0%, to $9.7 million in 2020 from $10.0 million in 2019.\nInterest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net decreased $3.9 million, or 27.1%, to $10.5 million in 2020 compared to $14.4 million in 2019. Interest expense, net, includes interest, amortization of loan origination costs related to borrowings and facility fees and interest on finance lease obligations. The decrease in net interest expense was due primarily to a decrease in the average borrowing rate and lower average borrowings. Average borrowings in 2020 were $259.5 million with a weighted-average interest rate of 1.8% compared to average borrowings of $303.2 million and a weighted-average interest rate of 3.4% in 2019.\nForeign Currency Transaction Losses, Net. We recognized a foreign currency transaction loss of $0.9 million in 2020 compared to a loss of $0.8 million in 2019. During times of a strengthening U.S. dollar, we generally record foreign currency losses from our Canadian operations. Conversely, during times of a weakening U.S. dollar, we generally record foreign currency gains.\nIncome Taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our effective tax rate was a provision of 24.1% in 2020 compared to a provision of 25.5% in 2019.\nAdjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure (see reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income in Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d), increased $11.5 million, or 6.0%, to $202.2 million in 2020 from $190.7 million for the same period in 2019. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was driven primarily by higher operating income in 2020 attained through cost leverage and an increase in inventory holding gains.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nThe financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Core-Mark uses certain non-GAAP financial measures including (i) Adjusted EBITDA, (ii) net sales, less excise taxes, (iii) remaining gross profit (including cigarette remaining gross profit and food/non-food remaining gross profit), (iv) remaining gross profit margin (including cigarette remaining gross profit margin and food/non-food remaining gross profit margin), (v) remaining gross profit margin less excise taxes (including cigarette remaining gross profit margin less excise taxes and food/non-food remaining gross profit margin less excise taxes), (vi) cigarette remaining gross profit per carton and (vii) operating expenses (and the components thereof) as a percentage of remaining gross profit. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information for investors regarding the performance of our business and facilitate a meaningful period to period evaluation. We also believe these measures allow investors to view results in a manner similar to the method used by our management. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in order to have comparable financial results to analyze changes in our underlying business. These non-GAAP measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be defined differently than other companies and therefore, such measures used by other companies may not be comparable to ours. We strongly encourage investors and stockholders to review our financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. These non-GAAP measures are defined as follows:\n(i) Adjusted EBITDA is a measure used by management to measure operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is equal to net income adding back net interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, LIFO expense, stock-based compensation expense, net foreign currency transaction gains or losses. See the table below for additional details on the components of Adjusted EBITDA. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is one of the primary measures used externally by our investors, analysts and peers in our industry for purposes of valuation and comparing our results to other companies.\n(ii) Net sales less excise taxes is a non-GAAP financial measure which we provide to separate the increase in sales and gross profits due to product sales growth and increases in state, local and provincial excise taxes, which we are responsible for collecting and remitting. Federal excise taxes are levied on the manufacturers who pass the tax on to us as part of the product cost and thus are not a component of our excise taxes. Although increases in cigarette taxes result in higher net sales, our overall gross profit percentage may be reduced.\n(iii) Remaining gross profit (including cigarette remaining gross profit and food/non-food remaining gross profit), (iv) remaining gross profit margin (including cigarette remaining gross profit margin and food/non-food remaining gross profit margin), (v) remaining gross profit margin less excise taxes (including cigarette remaining gross profit margin less excise taxes and food/non-food remaining gross profit margin less excise taxes), and (vi) cigarette remaining gross profit per carton, are non-GAAP financial measures, which we provide to segregate the effects of LIFO expense, cigarette holding gains and certain other items that significantly affect the comparability of gross profit.\n(vii) Operating expenses (and the components thereof) as a percentage of remaining gross profit is a non-GAAP financial measure, which is used by management to measure operating leverage. Although management also uses operating expenses as a percentage of net sales, this metric may be impacted on a comparable basis by, among other items, excise taxes, changes in manufacturers' prices (including inflation), and our continuing trend in sales mix shift from cigarettes to higher-margin food/non-food items which have substantially lower selling prices.\nThe following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to net income, as net income is the most comparable financial measure under U.S. GAAP (in millions):\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

appropriate tax authorities. Federal excise taxes are levied on the manufacturers who pass the tax on to us as part of the product cost and thus are not a component of our excise taxes.

We have historically funded our liquidity requirements through our cash flows from operations and external borrowings. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our cash flows provided by operating activities were $147.8 million. Subject to borrowing base limitations, we had $402.4 million of borrowing capacity available under our Credit Facility, excluding the expansion feature of $200.0 million, as of December 31, 2020.\nWe are potentially exposed to increased credit risk as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. While the vast majority of our customers are convenience retailers that continue to operate as essential businesses, our customers include smaller independent convenience retailers that may face liquidity constraints as a result of reduced store traffic. Our customers also include non-convenience store formats including hotel gift shops, casinos, tobacco shops, schools, airport concessions and other specialty and small format stores that carry convenience products. Some of these customers may have temporarily ceased, or significantly reduced, operations due to government-imposed restrictions, while others have seen a material decline in store traffic.\nWe have taken actions to help preserve liquidity, including reducing operating costs to better align with the current sales volume trends and closely managing our accounts receivable and capital expenditures.\nGiven our financial strength coming into the pandemic and ample availability of capital, we expect to be able to maintain adequate liquidity through the current environment, subject to the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nOur cash flows from operating activities provided net cash of $147.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to net cash provided of $89.7 million for the same period in 2019, an increase of $58.1 million. The increase was primarily attributable to changes in working capital, which was a cash use of $16.2 million or $54.0 million lower than the comparative period, and an increase in Adjusted EBITDA (see reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income in Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d).\nOur cash flows from operating activities were impacted by the following movements in working capital (in millions):\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts receivable, net </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other receivables, net </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.8) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventories, net </td> <td> </td> <td>(119.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(114.8) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deposits, prepayments and other non-current assets </td> <td> </td> <td>20.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(42.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts payable </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cigarette and tobacco taxes payable </td> <td> </td> <td>21.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(20.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension, claims, accrued and other long-term liabilities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>39.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(16.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(70.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWorking capital contributions used cash of $16.2 million for 2020, compared to cash used of $70.2 million for 2019. These contributions for the comparative periods were impacted by, among other items, an increase of inventory levels and cigarette and tobacco taxes payable, partially offset by a decrease of deposits, prepayments and other non-current assets due primarily to the timing of prepayments to cigarette vendors.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nOur investing activities used net cash of $29.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $31.0 million for the same period in 2019, a decrease in cash use of $1.4 million. Capitalization of software and related development costs were $3.5 million for 2020 compared to $6.0 million for 2019. Additions to property and equipment were $27.2 million for 2020 compared to $22.8 million for the same period in 2019, an increase in cash use of $4.4 million. We expect capital expenditures for 2021 to be approximately $45 million, which will be utilized primarily for maintenance and technology initiatives, as well as upgrades to certain distribution facilities and the relocation of one distribution facility.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nOur financing activities used net cash of $107.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $71.2 million of net cash used for the same period in 2019, a change of $36.7 million. Net repayments under our Credit Facility during the year ended December 31, 2020, were $66.8 million compared to net borrowings of $4.8 million in 2019. Book overdrafts increased $7.2 million, caused by the level of cash on hand in relation to the timing of accounts payable and vendor prepayments. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased $10.4 million of our common stock under the 2020 Program, compared to repurchases of $22.0 million in 2019 under the Prior Program.\nOur Credit Facility\nWe have a Credit Facility with a borrowing capacity of $750 million as of December 31, 2020, limited by a borrowing base consisting of eligible accounts receivable and inventories. The Credit Facility expires in February 2026 and has an expansion feature which permits an increase up to an additional $200 million, subject to borrowing base requirements. All obligations under the Credit Facility are secured by first-priority liens on substantially all of our present and future assets. The terms of the Credit Facility permit prepayment without penalty at any time (subject to customary breakage costs with respect to the London Interbank Offer Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) or Canadian Dollar Offer Rate based loans prepaid prior to the end of an interest period). The Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and restrictive covenants. In addition, the Credit Facility allows for unlimited stock repurchases and dividends as long as we meet certain credit availability percentages and fixed charge coverage ratios. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the Credit Facility. See Note 18 - Subsequent Events for changes to our Credit Facility.\nAmounts related to the Credit Facility are as follows (in millions):\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amounts borrowed, net </td> <td>$ </td> <td>258.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>324.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Outstanding letters of credit </td> <td>19.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amounts available to borrow(1)\n</td> <td>402.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>341.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average borrowings for the year(2)\n</td> <td>259.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>303.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Range of borrowings for the year </td> <td>69.0 - 499.3 </td> <td> </td> <td>141.7 - 508.0 </td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________________________________________\n(1) Subject to borrowing base limitations, and excluding expansion feature of $200.0 million.\n(2) See Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional details on the decrease in average borrowings.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nContractual Obligations.

See Our Credit Facility above.\n(2) Our purchase obligations at December 31, 2020 were related primarily to purchases of compressed natural gas for our trucking fleet, delivery and warehouse equipment, computer software and services, and leasehold improvements (see Note 9 - Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements).\n(3) The majority of our sales offices, warehouse facilities and trucks are subject to lease agreements which expire at various dates through 2037, excluding renewal options. We are generally required to incur maintenance, insurance and property tax expenses in connection with our lease agreements. In most instances, we expect the leases that expire will be renewed or replaced in the normal course of our business.\n(4) Represents net future minimum lease payments for warehouse facilities and other office, vehicle and warehouse equipment. Current maturities of finance leases are included in accrued liabilities and non-current maturities are included in long-term debt. Interest costs associated with the finance leases are included in the table above.\n(5) We have not included in the table above gross claims liabilities of $60.7 million, which includes workers' compensation, health and welfare, and general and auto liabilities because they do not have a definite payout by year. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Claims Liabilities and Insurance Recoverables. See also Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nLetters of Credit. As of December 31, 2020, our standby letters of credit issued under our Credit Facility were $19.5 million and related primarily to casualty insurance. The majority of the standby letters of credit mature in one year. However, in the ordinary course of our business, we will continue to renew or modify the terms of the letters of credit to support business requirements. The liabilities underlying the letters of credit are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of our Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. The critical accounting polices used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments with regards to estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We believe the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our financial statements are appropriate; however, actual results could differ from these estimates.\nWe consider the allowance for credit losses, claims liabilities and insurance recoverables and valuation of long-lived assets and goodwill to be those estimates which involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. We believe that the following represent the more critical accounting policies, which are subject to estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been increased uncertainty and disruption in the global economy and financial markets. We are not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require updates to our estimates or judgments or require us to revise the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of December 31, 2020.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses we estimate will arise from our trade customers' inability to make required payments. We evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable and determine the appropriate allowance for credit losses based on historical experience, economic conditions and a review of specific customer accounts. In determining the adequacy of allowances for customer receivables, we analyze factors such as the value of any collateral, customer financial statements, historical collection experience, aging of receivables, general economic conditions and other factors. It is possible that the accuracy of the estimation process could be materially affected by different judgments as to the collectability based on information considered and further deterioration of accounts. If circumstances change (i.e., further evidence of material adverse creditworthiness, additional accounts become credit risks, store closures or deterioration in general economic conditions), our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount.\nThe allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2020 and 2019 amounted to 4.3% and 3.5%, respectively, of gross trade accounts receivable.\nCredit loss expense associated with our trade customer receivables was $7.6 million and $7.1 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. As a percentage of net sales, our credit loss expense was less than 0.1% for each of 2020 and 2019.\nClaims Liabilities and Insurance Recoverables\nWe maintain reserves related to workers' compensation, auto and general liability and health and welfare programs that are principally self-insured. Our workers' compensation, auto and general liability insurance policies currently include a deductible of $500,000 per occurrence and we maintain excess loss insurance that covers any health and welfare costs in excess of $400,000 per person per year.\nOur reserves for workers' compensation, auto and general insurance liabilities are estimated based on applying an actuarially derived loss development factor to our incurred losses, including losses for claims incurred but not yet reported.\nActuarial projections of losses concerning workers' compensation, auto and general insurance liabilities are subject to a high degree of variability. Among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting future inflation rates, health care costs, litigation trends, legal interpretations, legislative reforms, benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns. Our reserve for health and welfare claims includes an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported, which is derived primarily from historical experience.\nOur claim liabilities and the related recoverables from insurance carriers for estimated claims in excess of the deductible and other insured events are presented in their gross amounts because there is no right of offset. The following is a summary of our net reserves (in millions):\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Current </td> <td> </td> <td>Long-Term </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Current </td> <td> </td> <td>Long-Term </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross claims liabilities: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Workers' compensation\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>9.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Auto and general insurance\n</td> <td>7.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Health and welfare\n</td> <td>5.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total gross claims liabilities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>56.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance recoverables </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(15.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(19.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(14.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(17.5) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reserves, net: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Workers' compensation\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>8.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Auto and general insurance\n</td> <td>4.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Health and welfare\n</td> <td>5.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reserves, net </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in these reserves for 2020 was due primarily to new claims in 2020 as well as growth of older claims for our workers compensation, auto and general insurance. A 10% change in our incurred but not reported estimates would increase or decrease the estimated reserves for our workers' compensation, auto and general insurance, and health and welfare liabilities by $1.4 million, $0.5 million and $0.4 million as of December 31, 2020, respectively.\nValuation of Long-lived Assets\nWe review our long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable. Long-lived assets consist primarily of land, buildings, delivery, warehouse and office equipment, leasehold improvements and intangible assets with definite useful lives. An impairment of long-lived assets exists when the carrying amount of a long-lived asset, or asset group, exceeds its fair value. Impairment losses are recorded when the carrying amount of the impaired asset is not recoverable. Recoverability is determined by comparing the carrying amount of the asset (or asset group) to the undiscounted cash flows which are expected to be generated from its use. Our estimates of future cash flows are based on historical experience and management's expectations of relevant customers and markets and other operational factors. These estimates project future cash flows several years into the future and can be affected by factors such as competition, inflation and other economic conditions. We have assessed our asset groups and determined we have six asset groups. The determination of asset groups primarily considers revenue inter-dependencies related to larger chain customer agreements which are serviced by multiple distribution centers. We did not record impairment losses related to long-lived assets in any of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nValuation of Goodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Goodwill is not subject to amortization but must be evaluated for impairment. We test goodwill for impairment annually as of October 1, or whenever events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount. Our reporting units, which are the U.S. and Canada, also represent our operating segments. Whenever events or circumstances change, we assess the related qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The tests to evaluate goodwill for impairment are performed at the reporting unit level. In the quantitative impairment test, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, such excess represents the amount of goodwill impairment for which an impairment loss would be recorded. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and\nassumptions. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit is based on the discounted cash flow method, which is based on historical and forecasted amounts specific to each reporting unit and considers sales, gross profit, operating profit and cash flows and general economic and market conditions, as well as the impact of planned business and operational strategies and other estimates and assumptions for future growth rates, working capital and capital expenditures. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time, but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty. We did not record any impairment charges related to goodwill during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nIn connection with our annual goodwill impairment testing performed during 2020, the quantitative test indicated that the fair values of the applicable reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying values, and accordingly, no further testing of goodwill was required. However, changes in the judgments and estimates underlying our analysis of goodwill for possible impairment, including expected future cash flows and discount rate, could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of the reporting units in the future and could result in impairment of goodwill.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that are included under Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K. Also refer to Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d which is included after the Table of Contents in this Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis also includes non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide important perspective in understanding trends that may impact our business. These non-GAAP financial measures are discussed, including reconciliation of these measures to GAAP, under Non-GAAP Financial Information.\u201d\nThis section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. Discussions of 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 are not included in this Form 10-K and can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 2, 2020.\nOur Business\nCore-Mark is one of the largest marketers of fresh, food and broad-line supply solutions to the convenience retail industry in North America. We offer a full range of products, marketing programs and technology solutions to approximately 40,000 customer locations in the U.S. and Canada. Our customers include traditional convenience stores, drug stores, mass merchants, grocery stores, liquor stores, and other specialty and small format stores that carry convenience products. Our product offering includes cigarettes, other tobacco products ( OTP\u201d), alternative nicotine products, candy, snacks, food, including fresh products, groceries, dairy, bread, beverages, general merchandise and health and beauty care products. We operate a network of 32 distribution centers in the U.S. and Canada (excluding two distribution facilities we operate as a third-party logistics provider).\nBusiness Strategy Overview\nCore-Mark's mission is to be the most valued marketer of fresh, food and broad-line supply solutions to the convenience retail industry. Consistent with this mission, our strategic framework is centered around three key initiatives: growing sales and margins faster than the industry, providing industry-leading category management solutions and leveraging our cost structure. The convenience wholesale and retail industry remains highly fragmented, supporting significant opportunities for both organic growth and growth through strategic acquisitions. Core-Mark is one of the largest wholesale distributors to the convenience retail industry in North America, one of two national convenience distributors in the U.S. and the largest in Canada, and represents an estimated 7% market share of the in-store sales of convenience stores in North America.\nOur growth initiatives include elevating same store sales, gaining share of North American convenience stores and being opportunistic with traditional and industry-adjacent acquisition opportunities. While serving traditional convenience retailers remains the primary driver for our business, we serve a wide variety of alternative convenience retail formats including mass merchandisers, casinos, colleges and airports. Driving growth through these alternative convenience retail formats and channels is a core component of our strategy and we see significant opportunities to drive growth organically, through acquisitions and strategic partnerships. Our focus on providing industry-leading category management solutions to our customers positions us to partner with retailers to help increase their sales and profits. We offer a wide array of marketing programs, innovative product alternatives, data aggregation and loyalty solutions to our customers in pursuit of category management excellence. Core-Mark is also actively engaged in efforts to increase the leverage of our operating cost structure through a range of initiatives, including technology investments, centralizing transactional processes and employee engagement aimed at increasing productivity.\nWe believe consistent execution on the aforementioned strategic priorities will position Core-Mark as the leader in convenience retail distribution and provides a strong pathway to achieve sustainable shareholder returns.\nOther Business Developments\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on our operating results during the year ended December 31, 2020, and we expect the pandemic will continue to affect our business for some period of time. While the vast majority of our customers are convenience retailers that continue to operate as essential businesses, the unprecedented impact of the COVID-19 pandemic since the second quarter of 2020, including shelter-in-place orders by states, provinces, cities and counties resulted in a significant downturn in miles driven, resulting in a decline in convenience retail store visits across North America. Although we are seeing recovery as consumer purchase trends improve, we expect future results to continue to be impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDividends\nThe Board of Directors approved the following cash dividends in 2020 (in millions, except per share data):\n\n______________________________________________\n(1) Includes cash payments on declared dividends and payments made on time-based restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d) and performance share awards that vested subsequent to the payment date.\n(2) Amounts have been rounded for presentation purposes and may differ from unrounded amounts.\nWe paid dividends of $22.0 million and $20.8 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn February 24, 2020, our Board of Directors authorized a $60.0 million stock repurchase program (the 2020 Program\u201d), replacing our prior stock repurchase program (the Prior Program\u201d). At the time of approval, we had funds totaling $0.4 million remaining under the Prior Program which were subsequently retired unused. The timing, price and volume of purchases under the 2020 Program are based on market conditions, cash and liquidity requirements, relevant securities laws and other factors. The 2020 Program may be discontinued or amended at any time. The 2020 Program has no expiration date and terminates when the amount authorized has been expended or the Board of Directors withdraws its authorization.\nIn 2020, all stock repurchases were made under the 2020 Program, and we repurchased 407,971 shares of common stock for a total cost of $10.4 million, or an average price of $25.62 per share. As of December 31, 2020, $49.6 million remained available for future share repurchases under the 2020 Program. In 2019, under the Prior Program, we repurchased 767,681 shares of common stock for a total cost of $22.0 million, or an average price of $28.66 per share.\nOverview of 2020 Results\nDuring 2020, we continued to build on our sales and operational capabilities, as well as our financial foundation, to drive our long-term growth strategy. We delivered strong financial results and further enhanced our industry-leading offering of products and services despite the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur net sales in 2020 increased 1.7%, or $287.4 million, to $16,957.9 million compared to $16,670.5 million for 2019. The increase in net sales for the year was driven primarily by strong cigarette sales, including increases in cigarette manufacturers' prices and growth in cigarette carton sales, partially offset by a 2.3% decrease in sales of food/non-food. Sales of cigarettes and food/non-food products for the year were impacted by changes in consumer buying habits as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nGross profit in 2020 decreased $35.9 million, or 3.9%, to $888.3 million from $924.2 million in 2019, driven primarily by a shift in overall sales mix to cigarettes, which have lower margins compared with food/non-food products, and higher LIFO expense, partially offset by $1.9 million of incremental net inventory holding gains.\nGross profit margin was 5.24% of total net sales for 2020 compared to 5.54% in 2019. Remaining gross profit margin(1) decreased to 5.23% for 2020 from 5.53% in 2019. The decline in remaining gross profit margin was driven primarily by the change in the sales mix between cigarettes and food/non-food and a decline in margins within the food/non-food category resulting from a shift in sales mix and lower gross profit margins in certain categories. We expect our gross profit margin to continue to be impacted by both sales mix and lower margins in certain product categories for some period of time as a direct result of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOperating expenses in 2020 decreased 4.6%, or $38.0 million, to $793.6 million from $831.6 million in 2019. The decrease was driven primarily by increased productivity and cost savings initiatives, implemented mainly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As outlined in our press release on April 14, 2020, we took steps during the second quarter to reduce operating costs to better align them with sales volume trends and to preserve liquidity. We also achieved cost savings through actions to reduce other non-essential costs including travel, meetings and events and other discretionary expenditures. Operating expenses were 4.7% of total net sales for 2020 compared to 5.0% in 2019. Operating expenses were 89.4% of remaining gross profit(1) for 2020, compared to 90.2% of remaining gross profit in 2019.\nNet income in 2020 increased 9.5%, or $5.5 million, to $63.2 million from $57.7 million in 2019. Adjusted EBITDA(1) increased $11.5 million, or 6.0%, to $202.2 million in 2020 from $190.7 million in 2019.\n________________________________________\n(1)Remaining gross profit margin, Adjusted EBITDA and operating expenses as a percentage of remaining gross profit are non-GAAP financial measures and should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). See Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d for reconciliation.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of 2020 and 2019 (in millions, except percentages)(1):\n\n______________________________________________\n(1) Amounts and percentages have been rounded for presentation purposes and might differ from unrounded results.\n(2) See the reconciliation of net sales, less excise taxes to net sales in Non-GAAP Financial Information.\u201d\n(3) Gross profit may not be comparable to those of other entities because warehousing and distribution expenses are not included as a component of our cost of goods sold.\n(4) Gross profit for 2020 includes LIFO expense of $30.7 million compared to $27.6 million in 2019.\n(5) See the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income in Non-GAAP Financial Information.\u201d\nNet Sales. Net sales increased by $287.4 million, or 1.7%, to $16,957.9 million in 2020 from $16,670.5 million in 2019. The increase in net sales was driven primarily by strong cigarette sales, including increases in cigarette manufacturers' prices and growth in cigarette carton sales, partially offset by a decrease in food/non-food sales to existing customers and a net decrease in the number of stores serviced during the year. Sales of both cigarettes and food/non-food products in 2020 were impacted by changes in consumer buying habits as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nNet Sales of Cigarettes. Net sales of cigarettes in 2020 increased by $417.8 million, or 3.8%, to $11,310.5 million from $10,892.7 million in 2019. The increase in cigarette sales was driven primarily by a 3.6% increase in the average sales price per carton due to cigarette manufacturers' price increases and a 0.3% increase in carton sales. Cigarette carton sales increased by 0.2% and 0.7% in the U.S. and Canada, respectively, driven by a 2.3% increase in carton sales to existing customers, partially offset by a net decrease in the number of stores serviced during the year. Cigarette carton sales to existing customers in 2020 outperformed recent downward trends, due primarily to changes in consumer buying behavior as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe believe long-term cigarette consumption will be adversely impacted by rising prices, increases in excise taxes and other legislative actions, diminishing social acceptance, sales through illicit markets and increasing use of alternative nicotine products. We expect cigarette manufacturers will raise prices as carton sales decline in order to maintain or enhance their\noverall profitability, thus partially mitigating the effect of the declines to distributors. Historical industry data indicates that convenience retailers have more than offset cigarette profit declines through sales growth in food/non-food products.\nNet cigarette sales as a percentage of total net sales were 66.7% in 2020 compared to 65.3% in 2019. The increase in the percentage of net cigarette sales in 2020 was due primarily to changes in consumer buying behavior as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nNet Sales of Food/Non-food Products. Net sales of food/non-food products in 2020 decreased $130.4 million, or 2.3%, to $5,647.4 million from $5,777.8 million in 2019.\nThe following table provides net sales by product category for our food/non-food products (in millions, except percentages) (1):\n\n______________________________________________\n(1) Amounts and percentages have been rounded for presentation purposes and might differ from unrounded results.\nThe decrease in food/non-food sales in 2020 was driven primarily by a decrease in sales to existing customers and a net decrease in the number of stores serviced during the year due primarily to the changes in consumer buying behavior as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The largest sales declines were in the food, HB&G and candy categories, partially offset by growth in OTP sales to existing customers. Our HB&G category was also impacted by a decline in sales of alternative nicotine products, which was impacted by both the changes in consumer buying behavior due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the enactment of regulations governing the sale of flavored product categories.\nTotal net sales of food/non-food products as a percentage of total net sales were 33.3% in 2020 compared to 34.7% in 2019.\nGross Profit. Gross profit represents profit after deducting cost of goods sold from net sales during the period. Inventory holding gains represent incremental revenues whereas vendor incentives, OTP tax refunds and changes in LIFO reserves are components of cost of goods sold. Gross profit in 2020 decreased $35.9 million, or 3.9%, to $888.3 million from $924.2 million in 2019, driven primarily by the overall shift in sales mix to cigarettes, which have lower margins than food/non-food products, and higher LIFO expense, partially offset by $1.9 million of incremental inventory holding gains.\nThe following table provides the components comprising the change in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for 2020 and 2019 (in millions, except percentages)(1):\n\n______________________________________________\n(1) Amounts and percentages have been rounded for presentation purposes and might differ from unrounded results.\n(2) See the reconciliation of net sales, less excise taxes to net sales in Non-GAAP Financial Information.\u201d\n(3) In 2020, $29.8 million and $2.0 million of the cigarette inventory holding gains were attributable to the U.S. and Canada, respectively. In 2019, $21.3 million and $1.7 million of the cigarette inventory holding gains were attributable to the U.S. and Canada, respectively.\n(4) In 2019, all $6.9 million of candy inventory holding gains were attributable to the U.S.\n(5) The increase of $3.1 million in LIFO expense in 2020 was due primarily to an increase in the Producer Price Index ( PPI\u201d) for cigarettes and an increase in inventory levels (see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements).\n(6) Remaining gross profit is a non-GAAP financial measure, which we provide to segregate the effects of LIFO expense, cigarette inventory holding gains and other items that significantly affect the comparability of gross profit (see reconciliation of remaining gross profit to gross profit in Non-GAAP Financial Information.\u201d)\nGross profit margin decreased 30 basis points to 5.24% of total net sales during 2020 from 5.54% in 2019. The change in the sales mix between cigarettes and food/non-food contributed to approximately 47% of the gross profit margin decline. In addition, the decrease in gross profit margin for 2020 was driven primarily by an overall decline in food/non-food margins as a result of a shift in sales mix toward lower margin items, such as OTP, due primarily to changes in consumer buying habits as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, lower margins within the HB&G category, primarily in alternative nicotine products, also contributed to the decline in overall food/non-food gross profit margin.\nDistributors such as Core-Mark may, from time to time, earn higher gross profits on inventory and excise tax stamp quantities on hand at the time manufacturers increase their prices or when states, localities or provinces increase their excise taxes. Such increases are reflected in customer pricing for all subsequent sales, including sales of inventory on hand at the time of the increase. The resulting higher gross profits are referred to as inventory holding gains. In 2020, we had $1.9 million higher inventory holding gains compared to 2019. Cigarette inventory holding gains, which were impacted by the timing and amount of cigarette manufacturers' price increases, increased $8.8 million in 2020, offset by $6.9 million in inventory holding gains related to a candy price increase in 2019. Historically, significant price increases from candy manufacturers have only occurred every three to four years.\nWe expect cigarette manufacturers will continue to raise prices as carton sales decline in order to maintain or enhance their overall profitability and the various taxing jurisdictions will raise excise taxes to make up for lost tax dollars related to consumption declines.\nLIFO expense was $30.7 million in 2020 compared to $27.6 million in 2019. Since we value our inventory in the U.S. on a LIFO basis, our gross profit can be positively or negatively impacted depending on the relative level of price inflation or\ndeflation in manufacturer prices as reported in the Bureau of Labor Statistics PPI used to estimate and record our book LIFO expense (see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements).\nRemaining gross profit, a non-GAAP financial measure (see reconciliation of remaining gross profit to gross profit in Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d), decreased $34.7 million, or 3.8%, to $887.2 million in 2020 from $921.9 million in 2019. Remaining gross profit margin, a non-GAAP financial measure (see reconciliation of remaining gross profit margin, as well as an explanation of its significance, in Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d) decreased to 5.23% in 2020 compared to 5.53% in 2019, driven primarily by the impact of a shift in sales mix towards lower margin cigarettes, a shift in the sales mix within food/non-food towards lower margin categories and lower margins within the HB&G category, primarily in alternative nicotine products.\nCigarette remaining gross profit, a non-GAAP financial measure (see reconciliation of cigarette remaining gross profit to cigarette gross profit in Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d), increased $7.3 million, or 3.4%, to $220.9 million in 2020 from $213.6 million for the same period in 2019. The increase in cigarette remaining gross profit was driven primarily by a 3.1% increase in remaining gross profit per carton and a 0.3% increase in cigarette carton sales.\nFood/non-food remaining gross profit, a non-GAAP financial measure (see reconciliation of food/non-food remaining gross profit to food/non-food gross profit in Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d), decreased $42.0 million or 5.9% to $666.3 million, in 2020 from $708.3 million in 2019. Food/non-food remaining gross profit margin, a non-GAAP financial measure (see reconciliation of food/non-food remaining gross profit margin in Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d), decreased to 11.80% in 2020 from 12.26% in 2019, driven primarily by a decrease in sales in certain higher margin categories including food and HB&G, an increase in sales in our lower margin OTP category, and a decline in margin rate, primarily in alternative nicotine products within the HB&G category.\nIn 2020, our remaining gross profit for food/non-food products was 75.1% of our total remaining gross profit compared to 76.8% for 2019.\nOperating Expenses. Our operating expenses include costs related to warehousing and distribution, SG&A expenses and amortization of intangible assets. In 2020, operating expenses decreased by $38.0 million, or 4.6%, to $793.6 million from $831.6 million in 2019. The decrease was driven primarily by increased productivity and cost savings initiatives implemented mainly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a percentage of total net sales, operating expenses were 4.7% in 2020 compared to 5.0% in 2019. Operating expenses were 89.4% of remaining gross profit, a non-GAAP financial ratio (see reconciliation of operating expenses as a percentage of remaining gross profit, as well as an explanation of its significance, in Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d) in 2020, compared to 90.2% of remaining gross profit in 2019. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of remaining gross profit was due primarily to operating expense reductions that more than offset the decline in remaining gross profit.\nWarehousing and Distribution Expenses. Warehousing and distribution expenses decreased $24.5 million, or 4.3%, to $541.7 million in 2020 from $566.2 million in 2019. The decrease in warehousing and distribution expenses was due primarily to cost reductions, an increase in productivity and fewer deliveries. Warehousing and distribution expenses were 3.2% of total net sales in 2020 compared to 3.4% of total net sales in 2019. Warehousing and distribution expenses were 61.1% of remaining gross profit, a non-GAAP financial ratio (see reconciliation of operating expenses as a percentage of remaining gross profit, as well as an explanation of its significance, in Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d), in 2020, compared to 61.4% of remaining gross profit in 2019.\nSelling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d) Expenses. SG&A expenses decreased $13.2 million, or 5.2%, to $242.2 million in 2020 from $255.4 million in 2019. The reduction in SG&A expenses was due primarily to cost savings initiatives. SG&A expenses for 2019 included $2.3 million of incremental costs related to the relocation of our headquarters. SG&A expenses were 1.4% of total net sales in 2020 compared to 1.5% of total net sales in 2019. SG&A was 27.3% of remaining gross profit, a non-GAAP financial ratio (see reconciliation of operating expenses as a percentage of remaining gross profit, as well as an explanation of its significance, in Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d), in 2020, compared to 27.7% of remaining gross profit in 2019.\nAmortization Expense. Amortization expense decreased $0.3 million, or 3.0%, to $9.7 million in 2020 from $10.0 million in 2019.\nInterest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net decreased $3.9 million, or 27.1%, to $10.5 million in 2020 compared to $14.4 million in 2019. Interest expense, net, includes interest, amortization of loan origination costs related to borrowings and facility fees and interest on finance lease obligations. The decrease in net interest expense was due primarily to a decrease in the average borrowing rate and lower average borrowings. Average borrowings in 2020 were $259.5 million with a weighted-average interest rate of 1.8% compared to average borrowings of $303.2 million and a weighted-average interest rate of 3.4% in 2019.\nForeign Currency Transaction Losses, Net. We recognized a foreign currency transaction loss of $0.9 million in 2020 compared to a loss of $0.8 million in 2019. During times of a strengthening U.S. dollar, we generally record foreign currency losses from our Canadian operations. Conversely, during times of a weakening U.S. dollar, we generally record foreign currency gains.\nIncome Taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our effective tax rate was a provision of 24.1% in 2020 compared to a provision of 25.5% in 2019.\nAdjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure (see reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income in Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d), increased $11.5 million, or 6.0%, to $202.2 million in 2020 from $190.7 million for the same period in 2019. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was driven primarily by higher operating income in 2020 attained through cost leverage and an increase in inventory holding gains.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nThe financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Core-Mark uses certain non-GAAP financial measures including (i) Adjusted EBITDA, (ii) net sales, less excise taxes, (iii) remaining gross profit (including cigarette remaining gross profit and food/non-food remaining gross profit), (iv) remaining gross profit margin (including cigarette remaining gross profit margin and food/non-food remaining gross profit margin), (v) remaining gross profit margin less excise taxes (including cigarette remaining gross profit margin less excise taxes and food/non-food remaining gross profit margin less excise taxes), (vi) cigarette remaining gross profit per carton and (vii) operating expenses (and the components thereof) as a percentage of remaining gross profit. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information for investors regarding the performance of our business and facilitate a meaningful period to period evaluation. We also believe these measures allow investors to view results in a manner similar to the method used by our management. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in order to have comparable financial results to analyze changes in our underlying business. These non-GAAP measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be defined differently than other companies and therefore, such measures used by other companies may not be comparable to ours. We strongly encourage investors and stockholders to review our financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. These non-GAAP measures are defined as follows:\n(i) Adjusted EBITDA is a measure used by management to measure operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is equal to net income adding back net interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, LIFO expense, stock-based compensation expense, net foreign currency transaction gains or losses. See the table below for additional details on the components of Adjusted EBITDA. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is one of the primary measures used externally by our investors, analysts and peers in our industry for purposes of valuation and comparing our results to other companies.\n(ii) Net sales less excise taxes is a non-GAAP financial measure which we provide to separate the increase in sales and gross profits due to product sales growth and increases in state, local and provincial excise taxes, which we are responsible for collecting and remitting. Federal excise taxes are levied on the manufacturers who pass the tax on to us as part of the product cost and thus are not a component of our excise taxes. Although increases in cigarette taxes result in higher net sales, our overall gross profit percentage may be reduced.\n(iii) Remaining gross profit (including cigarette remaining gross profit and food/non-food remaining gross profit), (iv) remaining gross profit margin (including cigarette remaining gross profit margin and food/non-food remaining gross profit margin), (v) remaining gross profit margin less excise taxes (including cigarette remaining gross profit margin less excise taxes and food/non-food remaining gross profit margin less excise taxes), and (vi) cigarette remaining gross profit per carton, are non-GAAP financial measures, which we provide to segregate the effects of LIFO expense, cigarette holding gains and certain other items that significantly affect the comparability of gross profit.\n(vii) Operating expenses (and the components thereof) as a percentage of remaining gross profit is a non-GAAP financial measure, which is used by management to measure operating leverage. Although management also uses operating expenses as a percentage of net sales, this metric may be impacted on a comparable basis by, among other items, excise taxes, changes in manufacturers' prices (including inflation), and our continuing trend in sales mix shift from cigarettes to higher-margin food/non-food items which have substantially lower selling prices.\nThe following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to net income, as net income is the most comparable financial measure under U.S. GAAP (in millions):\n\n______________________________________________\n(1) Interest expense, net, is reported net of interest income.\nThe following tables reconcile net sales, less excise taxes to net sales and remaining gross profit to gross profit (including cigarette remaining gross profit and food/non-food remaining gross profit), their most comparable financial measures under U.S. GAAP (in millions, except percentages)(1):\n\n\n\n______________________________________________\n(1) Amounts and percentages have been rounded for presentation purposes and might differ from unrounded results.\n(2) Excise taxes included in our net sales consist of state, local and provincial excise taxes, for which we are the primary obligor and held responsible for remitting to the appropriate tax authorities. Federal excise taxes are levied on the manufacturers who pass the tax on to us as part of the product cost and thus are not a component of our excise taxes. Although increases in cigarette excise taxes result in higher net sales, our overall gross profit percentage may be reduced since gross profit dollars generally remain the same.\n(3) Cigarette gross profit includes (i) cigarette inventory holding gains related to manufacturers' price increases, (ii) increases in state, local and provincial excise taxes and (iii) LIFO effects. Cigarette inventory holding gains for the years 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $31.8 million, $23.0 million and $19.6 million, respectively. For 2018, we recognized cigarette tax stamp inventory holding gains, in the U.S. of $7.4 million.\n(4) Food/non-food gross profit includes (i) inventory holding gains related to manufacturers' price increases, (ii) increases in state, local and provincial excise taxes, and (iii) LIFO effects.\n(5) In 2019, we recognized $6.9 million of candy inventory holding gains attributable to the U.S. In 2018, other inventory holding gains consisted of $7.4 million cigarette tax stamp inventory holding gains attributable to the U.S.\nThe following table provides operating expenses as a percentage of remaining gross profit (in millions, except percentages)(1):\n\n______________________________________________\n(1) Amounts and percentages have been rounded for presentation purposes and may differ from unrounded results.\n(2) For the year ended December 31, 2020, $29.8 million and $2.0 million of the cigarette inventory holding gains were attributable to the U.S. and Canada, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2019, $21.3 million and $1.7 million of the cigarette holding gains were attributable to the U.S. and Canada, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2018, $17.3 million and $2.3 million of the cigarette holding gains were attributable to the U.S. and Canada, respectively.\n(3) For the year ended December 31, 2019, $6.9 million of the other inventory holding gains consisted of candy inventory holding gains attributable to the U.S. For the year ended December 31, 2018, $7.4 million of the other inventory holding gains consisted of cigarette tax stamp inventory holding gains attributable to the U.S.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur cash and cash equivalents were $22.8 million and $14.1 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOur liquidity requirements arise primarily from our working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements for our revolving credit facility ( Credit Facility\u201d), income taxes, repurchases of common stock and dividend payments. We have historically funded our liquidity requirements through our cash flows from operations and external borrowings. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our cash flows provided by operating activities were $147.8 million. Subject to borrowing base limitations, we had $402.4 million of borrowing capacity available under our Credit Facility, excluding the expansion feature of $200.0 million, as of December 31, 2020.\nWe are potentially exposed to increased credit risk as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. While the vast majority of our customers are convenience retailers that continue to operate as essential businesses, our customers include smaller independent convenience retailers that may face liquidity constraints as a result of reduced store traffic. Our customers also include non-convenience store formats including hotel gift shops, casinos, tobacco shops, schools, airport concessions and other specialty and small format stores that carry convenience products. Some of these customers may have temporarily ceased, or significantly reduced, operations due to government-imposed restrictions, while others have seen a material decline in store traffic.\nWe have taken actions to help preserve liquidity, including reducing operating costs to better align with the current sales volume trends and closely managing our accounts receivable and capital expenditures.\nGiven our financial strength coming into the pandemic and ample availability of capital, we expect to be able to maintain adequate liquidity through the current environment, subject to the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nOur cash flows from operating activities provided net cash of $147.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to net cash provided of $89.7 million for the same period in 2019, an increase of $58.1 million. The increase was primarily attributable to changes in working capital, which was a cash use of $16.2 million or $54.0 million lower than the comparative period, and an increase in Adjusted EBITDA (see reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income in Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d).\nOur cash flows from operating activities were impacted by the following movements in working capital (in millions):\n\nWorking capital contributions used cash of $16.2 million for 2020, compared to cash used of $70.2 million for 2019. These contributions for the comparative periods were impacted by, among other items, an increase of inventory levels and cigarette and tobacco taxes payable, partially offset by a decrease of deposits, prepayments and other non-current assets due primarily to the timing of prepayments to cigarette vendors.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nOur investing activities used net cash of $29.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $31.0 million for the same period in 2019, a decrease in cash use of $1.4 million. Capitalization of software and related development costs were $3.5 million for 2020 compared to $6.0 million for 2019. Additions to property and equipment were $27.2 million for 2020 compared to $22.8 million for the same period in 2019, an increase in cash use of $4.4 million. We expect capital expenditures for 2021 to be approximately $45 million, which will be utilized primarily for maintenance and technology initiatives, as well as upgrades to certain distribution facilities and the relocation of one distribution facility.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nOur financing activities used net cash of $107.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $71.2 million of net cash used for the same period in 2019, a change of $36.7 million. Net repayments under our Credit Facility during the year ended December 31, 2020, were $66.8 million compared to net borrowings of $4.8 million in 2019. Book overdrafts increased $7.2 million, caused by the level of cash on hand in relation to the timing of accounts payable and vendor prepayments. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased $10.4 million of our common stock under the 2020 Program, compared to repurchases of $22.0 million in 2019 under the Prior Program.\nOur Credit Facility\nWe have a Credit Facility with a borrowing capacity of $750 million as of December 31, 2020, limited by a borrowing base consisting of eligible accounts receivable and inventories. The Credit Facility expires in February 2026 and has an expansion feature which permits an increase up to an additional $200 million, subject to borrowing base requirements. All obligations under the Credit Facility are secured by first-priority liens on substantially all of our present and future assets. The terms of the Credit Facility permit prepayment without penalty at any time (subject to customary breakage costs with respect to the London Interbank Offer Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) or Canadian Dollar Offer Rate based loans prepaid prior to the end of an interest period). The Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and restrictive covenants. In addition, the Credit Facility allows for unlimited stock repurchases and dividends as long as we meet certain credit availability percentages and fixed charge coverage ratios. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the Credit Facility. See Note 18 - Subsequent Events for changes to our Credit Facility.\nAmounts related to the Credit Facility are as follows (in millions):\n\n______________________________________________\n(1) Subject to borrowing base limitations, and excluding expansion feature of $200.0 million.\n(2) See Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional details on the decrease in average borrowings.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nContractual Obligations. The following table presents information regarding our contractual obligations that existed as of December 31, 2020 (in millions):\n\n______________________________________________\n(1) Represents amounts borrowed under our Credit Facility and does not include interest costs associated with the Credit Facility due to the variation of outstanding debt at Prime-based or LIBOR-based interest rates. See Our Credit Facility above.\n(2) Our purchase obligations at December 31, 2020 were related primarily to purchases of compressed natural gas for our trucking fleet, delivery and warehouse equipment, computer software and services, and leasehold improvements (see Note 9 - Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements).\n(3) The majority of our sales offices, warehouse facilities and trucks are subject to lease agreements which expire at various dates through 2037, excluding renewal options. We are generally required to incur maintenance, insurance and property tax expenses in connection with our lease agreements. In most instances, we expect the leases that expire will be renewed or replaced in the normal course of our business.\n(4) Represents net future minimum lease payments for warehouse facilities and other office, vehicle and warehouse equipment. Current maturities of finance leases are included in accrued liabilities and non-current maturities are included in long-term debt. Interest costs associated with the finance leases are included in the table above.\n(5) We have not included in the table above gross claims liabilities of $60.7 million, which includes workers' compensation, health and welfare, and general and auto liabilities because they do not have a definite payout by year. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Claims Liabilities and Insurance Recoverables. See also Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nLetters of Credit. As of December 31, 2020, our standby letters of credit issued under our Credit Facility were $19.5 million and related primarily to casualty insurance. The majority of the standby letters of credit mature in one year. However, in the ordinary course of our business, we will continue to renew or modify the terms of the letters of credit to support business requirements. The liabilities underlying the letters of credit are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of our Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. The critical accounting polices used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments with regards to estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We believe the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our financial statements are appropriate; however, actual results could differ from these estimates.\nWe consider the allowance for credit losses, claims liabilities and insurance recoverables and valuation of long-lived assets and goodwill to be those estimates which involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. We believe that the following represent the more critical accounting policies, which are subject to estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been increased uncertainty and disruption in the global economy and financial markets. We are not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require updates to our estimates or judgments or require us to revise the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of December 31, 2020.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses we estimate will arise from our trade customers' inability to make required payments. We evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable and determine the appropriate allowance for credit losses based on historical experience, economic conditions and a review of specific customer accounts. In determining the adequacy of allowances for customer receivables, we analyze factors such as the value of any collateral, customer financial statements, historical collection experience, aging of receivables, general economic conditions and other factors. It is possible that the accuracy of the estimation process could be materially affected by different judgments as to the collectability based on information considered and further deterioration of accounts. If circumstances change (i.e., further evidence of material adverse creditworthiness, additional accounts become credit risks, store closures or deterioration in general economic conditions), our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount.\nThe allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2020 and 2019 amounted to 4.3% and 3.5%, respectively, of gross trade accounts receivable.\nCredit loss expense associated with our trade customer receivables was $7.6 million and $7.1 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. As a percentage of net sales, our credit loss expense was less than 0.1% for each of 2020 and 2019.\nClaims Liabilities and Insurance Recoverables\nWe maintain reserves related to workers' compensation, auto and general liability and health and welfare programs that are principally self-insured. Our workers' compensation, auto and general liability insurance policies currently include a deductible of $500,000 per occurrence and we maintain excess loss insurance that covers any health and welfare costs in excess of $400,000 per person per year.\nOur reserves for workers' compensation, auto and general insurance liabilities are estimated based on applying an actuarially derived loss development factor to our incurred losses, including losses for claims incurred but not yet reported.\nActuarial projections of losses concerning workers' compensation, auto and general insurance liabilities are subject to a high degree of variability. Among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting future inflation rates, health care costs, litigation trends, legal interpretations, legislative reforms, benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns. Our reserve for health and welfare claims includes an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported, which is derived primarily from historical experience.\nOur claim liabilities and the related recoverables from insurance carriers for estimated claims in excess of the deductible and other insured events are presented in their gross amounts because there is no right of offset. The following is a summary of our net reserves (in millions):\n\nThe increase in these reserves for 2020 was due primarily to new claims in 2020 as well as growth of older claims for our workers compensation, auto and general insurance. A 10% change in our incurred but not reported estimates would increase or decrease the estimated reserves for our workers' compensation, auto and general insurance, and health and welfare liabilities by $1.4 million, $0.5 million and $0.4 million as of December 31, 2020, respectively.\nValuation of Long-lived Assets\nWe review our long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable. Long-lived assets consist primarily of land, buildings, delivery, warehouse and office equipment, leasehold improvements and intangible assets with definite useful lives. An impairment of long-lived assets exists when the carrying amount of a long-lived asset, or asset group, exceeds its fair value. Impairment losses are recorded when the carrying amount of the impaired asset is not recoverable. Recoverability is determined by comparing the carrying amount of the asset (or asset group) to the undiscounted cash flows which are expected to be generated from its use. Our estimates of future cash flows are based on historical experience and management's expectations of relevant customers and markets and other operational factors. These estimates project future cash flows several years into the future and can be affected by factors such as competition, inflation and other economic conditions. We have assessed our asset groups and determined we have six asset groups. The determination of asset groups primarily considers revenue inter-dependencies related to larger chain customer agreements which are serviced by multiple distribution centers. We did not record impairment losses related to long-lived assets in any of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nValuation of Goodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Goodwill is not subject to amortization but must be evaluated for impairment. We test goodwill for impairment annually as of October 1, or whenever events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount. Our reporting units, which are the U.S. and Canada, also represent our operating segments. Whenever events or circumstances change, we assess the related qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The tests to evaluate goodwill for impairment are performed at the reporting unit level. In the quantitative impairment test, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, such excess represents the amount of goodwill impairment for which an impairment loss would be recorded. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and\nassumptions. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit is based on the discounted cash flow method, which is based on historical and forecasted amounts specific to each reporting unit and considers sales, gross profit, operating profit and cash flows and general economic and market conditions, as well as the impact of planned business and operational strategies and other estimates and assumptions for future growth rates, working capital and capital expenditures. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time, but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty. We did not record any impairment charges related to goodwill during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nIn connection with our annual goodwill impairment testing performed during 2020, the quantitative test indicated that the fair values of the applicable reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying values, and accordingly, no further testing of goodwill was required. However, changes in the judgments and estimates underlying our analysis of goodwill for possible impairment, including expected future cash flows and discount rate, could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of the reporting units in the future and could result in impairment of goodwill.", "item_7_tables": "Table 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

of Core-Mark, a major distributor to the North American convenience retail industry. It emphasizes the need to read it alongside the audited consolidated financial statements for detailed financial data.\n\nCore-Mark operates a network of 32 distribution centers in the U.S. and Canada, and its business strategy is focused on growing sales and margins faster than the industry, offering leading category management solutions, and leveraging cost structure for efficiency.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic affected Core-Mark's operations in 2020, with varying degrees of impact expected to continue in the future. Despite this disruption, Core-Mark continued its sales and operational capabilities, with net sales increasing by 1.7% to $16.96 billion in 2020, notably from cigarette sales.\n\nGross profit for 2020 reduced by 3.9% to $888.3 million from 2019, mainly due to a sales mix shift towards lower-margin cigarettes and higher LIFO expenses, yet operating expenses were reduced due to productivity and cost-saving initiatives.\n\nIn terms of shareholder returns, Core-Mark paid dividends totaling $22.0 million in 2020 and repurchased shares under a new $60 million stock repurchase program\u2014buying back 407,971 shares for a total of $10.4 million. Net income for 2020 amounted to $63.2 million, up by 9.5% from the previous year, and Adjusted EBITDA increased by 6.0% to $202.2 million.\n\nThe report also outlines Core-Mark's liquidity and capital resources, detailing cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities, and noting measures to mitigate liquidity risk amid the pandemic. The company's critical accounting policies surrounding claims liabilities, evaluation of long-lived assets, and goodwill are highlighted as well.\n\nThe report concludes with discussions about the company's existing contractual obligations and its off-balance sheet arrangements, indicating that the company's financial commitments are being effectively managed, even considering the challenges posed by the global health crisis.\n\n(Note: This summary attempts to condense a very detailed and complex financial report into a brief overview, thus some specific financial data and nuanced discussions about operations and strategies are omitted for brevity.)"}
