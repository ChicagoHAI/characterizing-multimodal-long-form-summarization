MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION\nForward-looking Statements\nWhen used in this Annual Report and in other documents filed or furnished by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), in the Company's press releases or other public or stockholder communications, and in oral statements made with the approval of an authorized executive officer, the words or phrases \"will likely result,\" \"are expected to,\" \"will continue,\" \"is anticipated,\" \"estimate,\" \"project,\" \"intends\" or similar expressions are intended to identify \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including, among other things, (i) non-interest expense reductions from Great Southern's banking center consolidations might be less than anticipated and the costs of the consolidation and impairment of the value of the affected premises might be greater than expected; (ii) expected revenues, cost savings, earnings accretion, synergies and other benefits from the Fifth Third Bank branch acquisition and the Company's other merger and acquisition activities might not be realized within the anticipated time frames or at all, and costs or difficulties relating to integration matters, including but not limited to customer and employee retention, might be greater than expected; (iii) changes in economic conditions, either nationally or in the Company's market areas; (iv) fluctuations in interest rates; (v) the risks of lending and investing activities, including changes in the level and direction of loan delinquencies and write-offs and changes in estimates of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses; (vi) the possibility of other-than-temporary impairments of securities held in the Company's securities portfolio; (vii) the Company's ability to access cost-effective funding; (viii) fluctuations in real estate values and both residential and commercial real estate market conditions; (ix) demand for loans and deposits in the Company's market areas; (x) the ability to adapt successfully to technological changes to meet customers' needs and developments in the marketplace; (xi) the possibility that security measures implemented might not be sufficient to mitigate the risk of a cyber attack or cyber theft, and that such security measures might not protect against systems failures or interruptions; (xii) legislative or regulatory changes that adversely affect the Company's business, including, without limitation, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and its implementing regulations, and the overdraft protection regulations and customers' responses thereto; (xiii) changes in accounting principles, policies or guidelines; (xiv) monetary and fiscal policies of the Federal Reserve Board and the U.S. Government and other governmental initiatives affecting the financial services industry; (xv) results of examinations of the Company and the Bank by their regulators, including the possibility that the regulators may, among other things, require the Company to increase its allowance for loan losses or to write-down assets; (xvi) costs and effects of litigation, including settlements and judgments; and (xvii) competition. The Company wishes to advise readers that the factors listed above and other risks described from time to time in documents filed or furnished by the Company with the SEC could affect the Company's financial performance and could cause the Company's actual results for future periods to differ materially from any opinions or statements expressed with respect to future periods in any current statements.\nThe Company does not undertake-and specifically declines any obligation- to publicly release the result of any revisions which may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.\nCritical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates\nThe accounting and reporting policies of the Company conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and general practices within the financial services industry. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nAllowance for Loan Losses and Valuation of Foreclosed Assets\nThe Company believes that the determination of the allowance for loan losses involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity than its other significant accounting policies. The allowance for loan losses is calculated with the objective of maintaining an allowance level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated loan losses. Management's determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio and other relevant factors. However, this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates of, among other things, expected default probabilities, loss once loans default, expected commitment usage, the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, value of collateral, estimated losses, and general amounts for historical loss experience.\nThe process also considers economic conditions, uncertainties in estimating losses and inherent risks in the loan portfolio. All of these factors may be susceptible to significant change. To the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates, additional provisions for loan losses may be required which would adversely impact earnings in future periods. In addition, the Bank's regulators could require additional provisions for loan losses as part of their examination process.\nAdditional discussion of the allowance for loan losses is included in \"Item 1. Business - Allowances for Losses on Loans and Foreclosed Assets.\" Inherent in this process is the evaluation of individual significant credit relationships. From time to time certain credit relationships may deteriorate due to payment performance, cash flow of the borrower, value of collateral, or other factors. In these instances, management may revise its loss estimates and assumptions for these specific credits due to changing circumstances. In some cases, additional losses may be realized; in other instances, the factors that led to the deterioration may improve or the credit may be refinanced elsewhere and allocated allowances may be released from the particular credit. In the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company began using a three-year average of historical losses for the general component of the allowance for loan loss calculation. The Company had previously used a five-year average. The Company believes that the three-year average provides a better representation of the current risks in the loan portfolio. This change was made after consultation with our regulators and third-party consultants, as well as a review of the practices used by the Company's peers. No other significant changes were made to management's overall methodology for evaluating the allowance for loan losses during the periods presented in the financial statements of this report.\nIn addition, the Company considers that the determination of the valuations of foreclosed assets held for sale involves a high degree of judgment and complexity. The carrying value of foreclosed assets reflects management's best estimate of the amount to be realized from the sales of the assets. While the estimate is generally based on a valuation by an independent appraiser or recent sales of similar properties, the amount that the Company realizes from the sales of the assets could differ materially from the carrying value reflected in the financial statements, resulting in losses that could adversely impact earnings in future periods.\nCarrying Value of Loans Acquired in FDIC-assisted Transactions and Indemnification Asset\nThe Company considers that the determination of the carrying value of loans acquired in the FDIC-assisted transactions and the carrying value of the related FDIC indemnification asset involves a high degree of judgment and complexity. The carrying value of the acquired loans and the FDIC indemnification asset reflect management's best ongoing estimates of the amounts to be realized on each of these assets. The Company determined initial fair value accounting estimates of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities in accordance with FASB ASC 805, Business Combinations. However, the amount that the Company realizes on these assets could differ materially from the carrying value reflected in its financial statements, based upon the timing of collections on the acquired loans in future periods. Because of the loss sharing agreements with the FDIC on certain of these assets, the Company should not incur any significant losses related to these assets. To the extent the actual values realized for the acquired loans are different from the estimates, the indemnification asset will generally be impacted in an offsetting manner due to the loss sharing support from the FDIC. Subsequent to the initial valuation, the Company continues to monitor identified loan pools and related loss sharing assets for changes in estimated cash flows projected for the loan pools, anticipated credit losses and changes in the accretable yield. Analysis of these variables requires significant estimates and a high degree of judgment. See Note 4 of the accompanying audited financial statements for additional information regarding the TeamBank, Vantus Bank, Sun Security Bank, InterBank and Valley Bank FDIC-assisted transactions.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are subject to an impairment test at least annually and more frequently if circumstances indicate their value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment using a process that estimates the fair value of each of the Company's reporting units compared with its carrying value. The Company defines reporting units as a level below each of its operating segments for which there is discrete financial information that is regularly reviewed. As of December 31, 2016, the Company has one reporting unit to which goodwill has been allocated - the Bank. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, then no impairment is recorded. If the carrying value amount exceeds the fair value of a reporting unit,\nfurther testing is completed comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill to its carrying value to measure the amount of impairment. Intangible assets that are not amortized will be tested for impairment at least annually by comparing the fair values of those assets to their carrying values. At December 31, 2016, goodwill consisted of $5.4 million at the Bank reporting unit, which included goodwill of $4.2 million that was recorded during 2016 related to the acquisition of 12 branches from Fifth Third Bank. Other identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization are amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of seven years. At December 31, 2016, the amortizable intangible assets consisted of core deposit intangibles of $7.1 million, including $3.8 million related to the Fifth Third Bank transaction in January 2016, $1.8 million related to the Valley Bank transaction in June 2014 and $519,000 related to the Boulevard Bank transaction in March 2014. These amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment if circumstances indicate their value may not be recoverable based on a comparison of fair value. See Note 1 of the accompanying audited financial statements for additional information.\nFor purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, the Company used a market approach to value its reporting unit. The market approach applies a market multiple, based on observed purchase transactions for each reporting unit, to the metrics appropriate for the valuation of the operating unit. Significant judgment is applied when goodwill is assessed for impairment. This judgment may include developing cash flow projections, selecting appropriate discount rates, identifying relevant market comparables and incorporating general economic and market conditions.\nBased on the Company's goodwill impairment testing, management does not believe any of its goodwill or other intangible assets are impaired as of December 31, 2016. While the Company believes no impairment existed at December 31, 2016, different conditions or assumptions used to measure fair value of the reporting unit, or changes in cash flows or profitability, if significantly negative or unfavorable, could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of the Company's impairment evaluation in the future.\nCurrent Economic Conditions\nChanges in economic conditions could cause the values of assets and liabilities recorded in the financial statements to change rapidly, resulting in material future adjustments in asset values, the allowance for loan losses, or capital that could negatively impact the Company's ability to meet regulatory capital requirements and maintain sufficient liquidity.\nFollowing the bursting of the housing bubble in mid-2007 and the subsequent housing market correction and subprime mortgage crisis, the United States entered into a significant prolonged economic downturn. Unemployment rose from 4.7% in November 2007 to peak at 10.0% in October 2009. The elevated unemployment levels negatively impacted consumer confidence, which had a detrimental impact on industry-wide performance nationally as well as in the Company's Midwest market area. Economic conditions have improved considerably over the past few years as indicated by increasing consumer confidence levels, increased economic activity and low unemployment levels.\nThe national unemployment rate decreased from 5.0% as of December 2015 to 4.7% as of December 2016. The labor force participation rate, which is the share of working-age Americans who are either employed or are actively looking for a job, remained level at 63%. The economy added 156,000 jobs in December 2016, with employment gains predominantly occurring in health care and social assistance. Job growth totaled 2.2 million in 2016, which was less than the 2.7 million increase in 2015. As of December 31, 2016, the unemployment rate for the Midwest, where most of the Company's business is conducted, was at 4.1% significantly lower than the 4.6% U.S. rate. Unemployment rates at December 31, 2016, were: Missouri at 4.4%, Arkansas at 3.9%, Kansas at 4.2%, Iowa at 3.6%, Nebraska at 3.4%, Minnesota at 3.9%, Oklahoma at 5.0% and Texas at 4.6%. A few state unemployment rates increased compared to December 2015 levels; however, Oklahoma was the only state with an unemployment rate greater than the national average. Oklahoma was affected by job losses in the manufacturing, mining and logging industries. Of the metropolitan areas in which Great Southern Bank does business, the Tulsa market area had the highest unemployment level at December 31, 2016 at 5.0%. The unemployment rate at 3.9 % for the Springfield market area was below the national average reported as of December 31, 2016. Metropolitan areas in Arkansas, Iowa, Nebraska and Minnesota boasted unemployment levels among the lowest in the nation.\nSales of newly built, single-family homes were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 536,000 units in December 2016, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the U.S. Census Bureau. This represents a 10.4% decrease since November 2016 and a 0.4% drop from the December 2015 rate of 538,000. The median sales price of new houses sold in December 2016 was $322,500, with an average sales price of $384,000. The seasonally adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of December 2016 was 259,000, which represented a supply of 5.8 months at the current sales rate. Sales of existing single-family homes closed out 2016 as the best year in a decade, even as sales declined in December as the result of ongoing affordability tensions and historically low supply levels. In December, existing sales decreased 2.8% resulting in sales only 0.7% higher than a year ago. First-time buyers made up 32% of those transactions, the biggest share in four years, easing concerns that a shortage of affordable houses has been pushing entry-level buyers out of the market. The median existing-home price for all housing types in December was $232,200, up 4% from December 2015 ($223,200). Total housing inventory at the end of December dropped 10.8% to 1.65 million existing homes available for sale, which is the lowest level since National Association of Realtors began tracking the supply of all housing types in 1999. Unsold inventory is at a 3.6 month supply at the current sales pace.\nDistressed sales, which include foreclosures and short sales, rose to 7% in December, down from 8% a year ago. Foreclosures sold for an average discount of 20% below market value, while short sales were discounted 10%.\nThe performance of commercial real estate markets has improved throughout the Company's market areas as shown by increased real estate sales and financing activity. According to real estate services firm CoStar Group, retail, office and industrial types of commercial real estate properties continue to improve or remain stable in occupancy, absorption and rental income, both nationally and in our market areas.\nWhile current economic indicators show improvement nationally in employment, housing starts and prices, commercial real estate occupancy, absorption and rental income, our management will continue to closely monitor regional, national and global economic conditions, as these could significantly impact our market areas.\nLoss Sharing Agreements\nOn April 26, 2016, Great Southern Bank executed an agreement with the FDIC to terminate the loss sharing agreements for Team Bank, Vantus Bank and Sun Security Bank, effective immediately. The agreement required the FDIC to pay $4.4 million to settle all outstanding items related to the terminated loss sharing agreements. As a result of entering into the agreement, assets that were covered by the terminated loss sharing agreements, including covered loans in the amount of $61.5 million and covered other real estate owned in the amount of $468,000 as of March 31, 2016, were reclassified as non-covered assets effective April 26, 2016. In anticipation of terminating the loss sharing agreements, an impairment of the related indemnification assets was recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2016 in the amount of $584,000. On the date of the termination, the indemnification asset balances (and certain other receivables from the FDIC) related to Team Bank, Vantus Bank and Sun Security Bank, which totaled $4.4 million at March 31, 2016, became $0 as a result of the receipt of funds from the FDIC as outlined in the termination agreement. There will be no future effects on non-interest income (expense) related to adjustments or amortization of the indemnification assets for Team Bank, Vantus Bank or Sun Security Bank; however, adjustments and amortization related to the InterBank indemnification asset and loss sharing agreement will continue. The remaining accretable yield adjustments that affect interest income are not changed by this transaction and continue to be recognized for all FDIC-assisted transactions in the same manner as they have been previously.\nThe termination of the loss sharing agreements for the TeamBank, Vantus Bank and Sun Security Bank transactions has had no impact on the yields for the loans that were previously covered under these agreements. All future recoveries, gains, losses and expenses related to these previously covered assets will now be recognized entirely by Great Southern Bank since the FDIC will no longer be sharing in such gains or losses. Accordingly, the Company's future earnings will be positively impacted to the extent the Company recognizes gains on any sales or recoveries in excess of the carrying value of such assets. Similarly, the Company's future earnings will be negatively impacted to the extent the Company recognizes expenses, losses or charge-offs related to such assets.\nGeneral\nThe profitability of the Company and, more specifically, the profitability of its primary subsidiary, the Bank, depends primarily on its net interest income, as well as provisions for loan losses and the level of non-interest income and non-interest expense. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income the Bank earns on its loans and investment portfolio, and the interest it pays on interest-bearing liabilities, which consists mainly of interest paid on deposits and borrowings. Net interest income is affected by the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on these balances. When interest-earning assets approximate or exceed interest-bearing liabilities, any positive interest rate spread will generate net interest income.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2016, Great Southern's total assets increased $446.5 million, or 10.9%, from $4.10 billion at December 31, 2015, to $4.55 billion at December 31, 2016. Full details of the current year changes in total assets are provided in the \"Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015\" section.\nLoans. In the year ended December 31, 2016, Great Southern's net loans increased $419.4 million, or 12.6%, from $3.34 billion at December 31, 2015, to $3.76 billion at December 31, 2016. Partially offsetting the increase in loans was a decrease of $79.7 million in the FDIC-acquired loan portfolios. Excluding previously acquired covered and non-covered loans and mortgage loans held for sale, but including the loans acquired from Fifth Third Bank, total loans increased $499.7 million from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016. The increases occurred across several loans types, primarily in other residential (multi-family) loans, commercial real estate loans, one- to four-family residential loans, consumer loans and home equity lines of credit. The increase was primarily due to loan growth in our existing banking center network, and also due to the loans acquired from Fifth Third Bank during the year. As loan demand is affected by a variety of factors, including general economic conditions, and because of the competition we face and our focus on pricing discipline and credit quality, we cannot be assured that our loan growth will match or exceed the level of increases achieved in 2016 or prior years. The Company's strategy continues to be focused on maintaining credit risk and interest rate risk at appropriate levels.\nLoan growth has occurred in most loan types and has come from most of Great Southern's primary lending locations, including Springfield, St. Louis, Kansas City, Des Moines, and Minneapolis, as well as the loan production offices in Dallas and Tulsa. Net loan balances have increased primarily in the areas of commercial construction, consumer, and commercial real estate (including multi-family). Generally, the Company considers these types of loans to involve a higher degree of risk compared to some other types of loans, such as first mortgage loans on one- to four-family, owner-occupied residential properties, and has established certain minimum underwriting standards to help assure portfolio quality. For commercial real estate and construction loans, these standards and procedures include, but are not limited to, an analysis of the borrower's financial condition, collateral, repayment ability, verification of liquid assets and credit history as required by loan type. In addition, geographic diversity of collateral, lower loan-to-value ratios and limitations on speculative construction projects help to mitigate overall risk in these loans. It has been, and continues to be, Great Southern's practice to verify information from potential borrowers regarding assets, income or payment ability and credit ratings as applicable and as required by the authority approving the loan. Underwriting standards also include loan-to-value ratios which vary depending on collateral type, debt service coverage ratios or debt payment to income ratios, where applicable, credit histories, use of guaranties and other recommended terms relating to equity requirements, amortization, and maturity. Great Southern's loan committee reviews and approves all new loan originations in excess of lender approval authorities. Consumer loans are primarily secured by new and used motor vehicles and these loans are also subject to certain minimum underwriting standards to assure portfolio quality. Great Southern's consumer underwriting and pricing standards have been fairly consistent over the past several years. The underwriting standards employed by Great Southern for consumer loans include a determination of the applicant's payment history on other debts, credit scores, employment history and an assessment of ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. Although creditworthiness of the applicant is of primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral, if any, in relation to the proposed loan amount.\nOf the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2016 and 2015, 75.9% and 73.5%, respectively, was secured by real estate, as this is the Bank's primary focus in its lending efforts. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, commercial real estate and commercial construction loans were 42.1% and 42.8% of the Bank's total loan portfolio (excluding loans acquired through FDIC-assisted transactions), respectively. Commercial real estate and commercial construction loans generally afford the Bank an opportunity to increase the yield on, and the proportion of interest rate sensitive loans in, its portfolio. They do, however, present somewhat greater risk to the Bank because they may be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the economy generally. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, loans made in the Springfield, Mo. metropolitan statistical area (Springfield MSA) were 12% and 15% of the Bank's total loan portfolio (excluding loans acquired through FDIC-assisted transactions), respectively. The Company's headquarters are located in Springfield and we have operated in this market since 1923. Because of our large presence and experience in the Springfield MSA, many lending opportunities exist. However, if the economic conditions of the Springfield MSA were worse than those of other market areas in which we operate or the national economy overall, the performance of these loans could decline comparatively. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, loans made in the St. Louis, Mo. metropolitan statistical area (St. Louis MSA) were 19% and 18% of the Bank's total loan portfolio (excluding loans acquired through FDIC-assisted transactions, but including loans acquired from Fifth Third Bank), respectively. The Company's expansion into the St. Louis MSA beginning in May 2009 has provided an opportunity to not only expand its markets and provide diversification from the Springfield MSA, but also has provided access to a larger economy with increased lending opportunities despite higher levels of competition. Loans made in the St. Louis MSA are primarily commercial real estate, commercial business and multi-family residential loans which are less likely to be impacted by the higher levels of unemployment rates, as mentioned above under \"Current Economic Conditions,\" than if the focus were on one- to four-family residential and consumer loans. For further discussions of the Bank's loan portfolio, and specifically, commercial real estate and commercial construction loans, see \"Item 1. Business - Lending Activities.\"\nThe percentage of fixed-rate loans in our loan portfolio has increased from 46% as of December 31, 2010 to 57% as of December 31, 2016 due to customer preference for fixed rate loans during this period of low interest rates. The majority of the increase in fixed rate loans was in commercial construction and consumer loans, both of which typically have loans with short durations. Of the total amount of fixed rate loans in our portfolio as of December 31, 2016, approximately 77% mature within one to five years and therefore are not considered to create significant long-term interest rate risk for the Company. Fixed rate loans make up only a portion of our balance sheet and our overall interest rate risk strategy. As of December 31, 2016, our interest rate risk models indicated a one-year interest rate earnings sensitivity position that is fairly neutral. For further discussion of our interest rate sensitivity gap and the processes used to manage our exposure to interest rate risk, see \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - How We Measure the Risks to Us Associated with Interest Rate Changes.\" For discussion of the risk factors associated with interest rate changes, see \"Risk Factors - We may be adversely affected by interest rate changes.\"\nWhile our policy allows us to lend up to 95% of the appraised value on one-to four-family residential properties, originations of loans with loan-to-value ratios at that level are minimal. Private mortgage insurance is typically required for loan amounts above the 80% level. Few exceptions occur and would be based on analyses which determined minimal transactional risk to be involved. We consider these lending practices to be consistent with or more conservative than what we believe to be the norm for banks our size. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, an estimated 0.2% and 0.2%, respectively, of total owner occupied one- to four-family\nresidential loans had loan-to-value ratios above 100% at origination. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, an estimated 1.3% and 2.1%, respectively, of total non-owner occupied one- to four-family residential loans had loan-to-value ratios above 100% at origination.\nAt December 31, 2016, troubled debt restructurings totaled $21.1 million, or 0.6% of total loans, down $23.9 million from $45.0 million, or 1.3% of total loans, at December 31, 2015. Concessions granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties may include a reduction in the interest rate on the loan, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance or other actions intended to maximize collection. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, no loans were restructured into multiple new loans. For further information on troubled debt restructurings, see Note 3 of the accompanying audited financial statements, which are included in Item 8 of this report.\nThe loss sharing agreement for InterBank with the FDIC is subject to limitations on the types of losses covered and the length of time losses are covered, and is conditioned upon the Bank complying with its requirements in the agreement with the FDIC, including requirements regarding servicing and other loan administration matters. The original terms of the loss sharing agreement extends for ten years for single family real estate loans and for five years for other loans. As noted above, the loss sharing agreements for Team Bank, Vantus Bank and Sun Security Bank were terminated on April 26, 2016.\nAt December 31, 2016, approximately five and one half years remained on the loss sharing agreement for single family real estate loans acquired from InterBank and the remaining loans had an estimated average life of four to twelve years. At December 31, 2016, approximately six months remained on the loss sharing agreement for non-single-family loans acquired from InterBank and the remaining loans had an estimated average life of one to two years. While the expected repayments for certain of the acquired loans extend beyond the terms of the loss sharing agreement, the Bank has identified and will continue to identify problem loans and will make every effort to resolve them within the time limits of the agreement. The Company may sell any loans remaining at the end of the loss sharing agreement subject to the approval of the FDIC.\nLoans that were acquired through FDIC-assisted transactions, which are accounted for in pools, are currently included in the analysis and estimation of the allowance for loan losses. If expected cash flows to be received on any given pool of loans decreases from previous estimates, then a determination is made as to whether the loan pool should be charged down or the allowance for loan losses should be increased (through a provision for loan losses). This is true of all acquired loan pools regardless of whether or not they are covered by a loss sharing agreement. If a charge down occurs to a loan pool that is covered by the loss sharing agreement, the full amount of the charge down will be reflected in the allowance for loan losses and a separate asset will be recorded for the amount to be recovered from the FDIC. The loss sharing agreements (both current and terminated) and their related limitations are described in detail in Note 4 of the accompanying audited financial statements, included in Item 8 of this Report. For acquired loan pools that currently are not covered by loss sharing agreements, the Company may allocate, and at December 31, 2016, has allocated, a portion of its allowance for loan losses related to these loan pools in a manner similar to how it allocates its allowance for loan losses to those loans which are collectively evaluated for impairment.\nThe level of non-performing loans and foreclosed assets affects our net interest income and net income. We generally do not accrue interest income on these loans and do not recognize interest income until the loans are repaid or interest payments have been made for a period of time sufficient to provide evidence of performance on the loans. Generally, the higher the level of non-performing assets, the greater the negative impact on interest income and net income.\nAvailable-for-sale Securities. In the year ended December 31, 2016, available-for-sale securities decreased $49.0 million, or 18.6%, from $262.9 million at December 31, 2015, to $213.9 million at December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to calls of municipal securities, sales of certain mortgage-backed securities, the sale of an investment in a managed equity fund held by the Company, and normal monthly payments received related to the portfolio of mortgage-backed securities, partially offset by the purchase of certain mortgage-backed securities. The Company was required to divest the investment it held in the managed equity fund as a result of regulations recently adopted by the Federal Reserve Board. Other investment securities were reduced because they were no longer needed for pledging for public fund deposits.\nPremises and Equipment, net. Great Southern had net premises and equipment of $140.6 million at December 31, 2016, an increase of $10.9 million, or 8.4%, from $129.7 million at December 31, 2015. The increase in premises and equipment was primarily due to the acquisition of 12 branches from Fifth Third Bank in January 2016. For further information on the acquisition, see the Company's March 31, 2016 Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The Company's goodwill and other intangible assets totaled $12.5 million at December 31, 2016, an increase of $6.7 million, or 117.1%, compared to $5.8 million at December 31, 2015. The increase was due to the goodwill and core deposit intangible amounts recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2016 related to the Fifth Third Bank branch acquisition, as discussed above in the \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets\" section of this report.\nDeposits. The Company attracts deposit accounts through its retail branch network, correspondent banking and corporate services areas, and brokered deposits. The Company then utilizes these deposit funds, along with FHLBank advances and other borrowings, to meet loan demand or otherwise fund its activities. In the year ended December 31, 2016, total deposit balances increased $408.6 million, or 12.5%. Transaction account balances increased $212.0 million, while retail certificates of deposit increased $156.1 million. These increases were primarily a result of the Bank's assumption of deposits as part of the Fifth Third Bank branch acquisition in January 2016, as well as growth at existing branches and new retail certificate of deposit product offerings. Great Southern Bank customer deposits totaling $14.0 million and $12.2 million, at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, were part of the CDARS program which allows bank customers to maintain balances in an insured manner that would otherwise exceed the FDIC deposit insurance limit. The FDIC counts these deposits as brokered, but these are deposit accounts that we generate with customers in our local markets. Brokered deposits, including CDARS program purchased funds, were $310.3 million at December 31, 2016, an increase of $38.8 million from $271.5 million at December 31, 2015.\nOur deposit balances may fluctuate depending on customer preferences and our relative need for funding. We do not consider our retail certificates of deposit to be guaranteed long-term funding because customers can withdraw their funds at any time with minimal interest penalty. When loan demand trends upward, we can increase rates paid on deposits to increase deposit balances and utilize brokered deposits to provide additional funding. The level of competition for deposits in our markets is high. It is our goal to gain deposit market share, particularly checking accounts, in our branch footprint. To accomplish this goal, increasing rates to attract deposits may be necessary, which could negatively impact the Company's net interest margin.\nOur ability to fund growth in future periods may also depend on our ability to continue to access brokered deposits and FHLBank advances. In times when our loan demand has outpaced our generation of new deposits, we have utilized brokered deposits and FHLBank advances to fund these loans. These funding sources have been attractive to us because we can create either fixed or variable rate funding, as desired, which more closely matches the interest rate nature of much of our loan portfolio. While we do not currently anticipate that our ability to access these sources will be reduced or eliminated in future periods, if this should happen, the limitation on our ability to fund additional loans could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nShort-term Borrowings and Federal Home Loan Bank Advances. Federal Home Loan Bank advances decreased $232.0 million from $263.5 million at December 31, 2015 to $31.5 million at December 31, 2016. The decreased advances were replaced with overnight fed funds borrowings through the FHLBank based on funding needs. As such, short-term borrowings increased by $171.0 million, from $1.3 million at December 31, 2015 to $172.3 million at December 31, 2016. The overnight fed funds borrowing rate was lower than the one week or longer term rates for FHLBank advances, so the Company elected to utilize the overnight borrowings.\nSubordinated Notes. In August 2016, the Company issued $75 million of 5.25% fixed-to-floating rate Subordinated Notes due August 15, 2026. The notes were sold at par, resulting in net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and commissions and other issuance costs, of approximately $73.5 million. The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes.\nNet Interest Income and Interest Rate Risk Management. Our net interest income may be affected positively or negatively by changes in market interest rates. A portion of our loan portfolio is tied to the \"prime rate\" and adjusts immediately when this rate adjusts (subject to the effect of loan interest rate floors, which are discussed below). We monitor our sensitivity to interest rate changes on an ongoing basis (see \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\"). In addition, our net interest income may be impacted by changes in the cash flows expected to be received from acquired loan pools. As described in Note 4 of the accompanying audited financial statements, which are included in Item 8 of this report, the Company's evaluation of cash flows expected to be received from acquired loan pools is on-going and increases in cash flow expectations are recognized as increases in accretable yield through interest income. Decreases in cash flow expectations are recognized as impairments through the allowance for loan losses.\nThe current level and shape of the interest rate yield curve poses challenges for interest rate risk management. Prior to its increases of 0.25% on December 16, 2015 and 0.25% on December 14, 2016, the FRB last changed interest rates on December 16, 2008. Great Southern has a substantial portion of its loan portfolio ($1.02 billion at December 31, 2016) which is tied to the one-month LIBOR index and will adjust at least once within 90 days after December 31, 2016. Of these loans, $471 million had interest rate floors.\nGreat Southern also has a significant portfolio of loans ($387 million at December 31, 2016) which are tied to a \"prime rate\" of interest and will adjust immediately with changes to the \"prime rate\" of interest. Most of these loans are tied to some national index of \"prime,\" while some are indexed to \"Great Southern Bank prime\" (GSB prime). The Company had elected to leave its GSB prime rate at 5.00%, but increased this rate to 5.25% in December 2015 following the FRB rate increase. The GSB prime rate was not changed following the FRB rate increase in December 2016. This does not affect a large number of customers, as there is no longer a significant portion of the loan portfolio indexed to the GSB prime rate. But for the interest rate floors, a rate cut by the FRB generally would have an anticipated immediate negative impact on the Company's net interest income due to the large total balance of loans which generally adjust immediately as the Federal Funds rate adjusts. Loans at their floor rates are, however, subject to the risk that\nborrowers will seek to refinance elsewhere at the lower market rate. Because the Federal Funds rate is already very low, there may also be a negative impact on the Company's net interest income due to the Company's inability to significantly lower its funding costs in the current competitive rate environment, although interest rates on assets may decline further. Conversely, interest rate increases would normally result in increased interest rates on our prime-based loans. The interest rate floors in effect may limit the immediate increase in interest rates on certain of these loans, until such time as rates rise above the floors. However, the Company may have to increase rates paid on deposits to maintain deposit balances and pay higher rates on borrowings. The impact of the low rate environment on our net interest margin in future periods is expected to be fairly neutral. Any margin gained by rate increases on loans may be somewhat offset by reduced yields from our investment securities and our existing loan portfolio as payments are made and the proceeds are potentially reinvested at lower rates. Interest rates on certain adjustable rate mortgage-backed securities and loans may reset lower according to their contractual terms and index rate to which they are tied and new loans may be originated at lower market rates than the overall portfolio rate. For further discussion of the processes used to manage our exposure to interest rate risk, see \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - How We Measure the Risks to Us Associated with Interest Rate Changes.\"\nThe negative impact of declining loan interest rates had been mitigated by the positive effects of the Company's loans which have interest rate floors. At December 31, 2016, the Company had a portfolio (excluding the loans acquired in the FDIC-assisted transactions) of prime-based loans totaling approximately $387 million with rates that change immediately with changes to the prime rate of interest. Of those loans, $382 million also had interest rate floors. These floors were at varying rates, with $8 million of these loans having floor rates of 7.0% or greater and another $76 million of these loans having floor rates between 5.0% and 7.0%. In addition, $298 million of these loans have floor rates between 2.75% and 5.0%. At December 31, 2016, $93 million of these loans were at their floor rates. Also included in these prime-based loans at December 31, 2016, the Company had a portfolio (excluding the loans acquired in the FDIC-assisted transactions) of GSB prime-based loans totaling approximately $60 million with rates that change immediately with changes to the GSB prime rate of interest. Of those loans, $58 million also had interest rate floors. At December 31, 2016, $16 million of the $58 million GSB prime rate loans with interest rate floors were at their floor rates. The loan yield for the total loan portfolio was approximately 83 basis points, 106 basis points and 141 basis points higher than the national \"prime rate of interest\" at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, partly because of these interest rate floors. While interest rate floors have had an overall positive effect on the Company's results during this period, they do subject the Company to the risk that borrowers will elect to refinance their loans with other lenders. To the extent economic conditions improve, the risk that borrowers will seek to refinance their loans increases.\nNon-Interest Income and Operating Expenses. The Company's profitability is also affected by the level of its non-interest income and operating expenses. Non-interest income consists primarily of service charges and ATM fees, accretion income (net of amortization) related to the FDIC-assisted acquisitions, late charges and prepayment fees on loans, gains on sales of loans and available-for-sale investments and other general operating income. In 2014, 2012, 2011 and 2009, non-interest income was also affected by the gains recognized on the FDIC-assisted transactions. In early 2016 and all of 2015 and 2014, increases in the cash flows expected to be collected from the FDIC-covered loan portfolios resulted in amortization (expense) recorded relating to reductions of expected reimbursements under the loss sharing agreements with the FDIC, which are recorded as indemnification assets. This is no longer the case for the TeamBank, Vantus Bank and Sun Security Bank transactions, subsequent to April 26, 2016 (due to the termination of the related loss sharing agreements effective as of that date). It is still the case for InterBank loans. Non-interest income may also be affected by the Company's interest rate derivative activities, if the Company chooses to implement derivatives.\nOperating expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits, occupancy-related expenses, expenses related to foreclosed assets, postage, FDIC deposit insurance, advertising and public relations, telephone, professional fees, office expenses and other general operating expenses. Details of the current period changes in non-interest income and non-interest expense are provided under \"Results of Operations and Comparison for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\"\nBusiness Initiatives\nThe Company completed several initiatives to expand and enhance the franchise in 2016.\nDuring 2016, the Company decreased its banking center network from 110 to 104 full-service retail offices. The Company regularly evaluates its banking center network and lines of business to ensure that it is serving customers in the best way possible. The banking center network constantly evolves with changes in customer needs and preferences, emerging technology and local market developments. In response to these changes, the Company opens banking centers and invests resources where customer demand leads, and from time to time, consolidates banking centers when market conditions dictate.\nOn January 29, 2016, Great Southern completed the acquisition of 12 branches and related deposits and loans from Cincinnati-based Fifth Third Bank in the St. Louis market area. This acquisition increased Great Southern's St. Louis-area banking center total from eight to ultimately 19 offices and doubled its customer deposit base in this market. The deposits assumed totaled approximately $228 million and the loans acquired totaled approximately $159 million.\nThroughout 2016, the Company consolidated operations of 16 banking centers into other nearby Great Southern offices. Each consolidated office was evaluated on a number of criteria, including access and availability of services to affected customers, the proximity of other Great Southern banking centers, profitability and transaction volumes and market dynamics. Of these 16 consolidated banking centers, eleven were in Missouri, four in Iowa and one was in Kansas. Nine of these banking centers were acquired as part of various FDIC-assisted acquisitions. In addition, the Company also sold two Missouri banking centers, with associated deposits, to separate buyers in early 2016. The Great Southern banking center located in Thayer, Mo., was sold on February 19, 2016, and the office in Buffalo, Mo., was sold on March 18, 2016.\nIn addition, in January 2017, two leased banking centers were replaced by two new owned offices in the Omaha, Neb., metropolitan market area. Both new locations offer better convenience and access to area customers. Great Southern operates four offices in the Omaha market area.\nThe Company executed an agreement with the FDIC to terminate loss sharing agreements related to the FDIC-assisted acquisitions of TeamBank, Vantus Bank and Sun Security Bank in April 2016. The agreement required the FDIC to pay $4.4 million to settle all outstanding items related to the terminated loss sharing agreements. As a result of entering into the agreement, assets that were covered by the terminated loss sharing agreements, including covered loans in the amount of $61.5 million and covered other real estate owned in the amount of $468,000 as of March 31, 2016, were reclassified as non-covered assets effective April 26, 2016. More information about this agreement can be found in the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016.\nIn July 2016, the Company filed a universal shelf registration statement (Form S-3) with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This registration allows the Company to expeditiously offer investors up to a total of $250 million in common stock, preferred stock, trust preferred securities or debt obligations. With the Board's prior approval, public offerings can be made at various times and for various amounts depending on the needs of the Company.\nIn August 2016, utilizing the shelf registration statement, the Company completed the public offering and sale of $75 million of its 5.25% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due August 15, 2026. The Notes were sold at par, resulting in net proceeds, after underwriting discounts, commissions and expenses, of approximately $73.5 million. The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes.\nIn October 2016, the Company began mass issuing chip-enabled debit cards in phases to its deposit customer base. The mass issuance was completed in February 2017. Chip debit cards offer customers an added layer of security, providing enhanced protection against fraud. Chip debit cards are also available instantly at all Great Southern banking centers.\nThe Company expects to open a commercial loan production office in downtown Chicago in the first quarter of 2017. A local and highly experienced commercial lender has been hired to manage that office. The Company also operates commercial loan production offices in Tulsa, Okla., and Dallas.\nA person-to-person (P2P) electronic payment service was introduced in early February 2017. Available for retail customers through the Company's smartphone mobile banking applications, the P2P service allows Great Southern debit card customers to send one-time transfers to recipients at any financial institution.\nThe Company's chief lending officer, Steve Mitchem, previously announced his plans to retire from the Company in April 2017. Mr. Mitchem joined Great Southern in 1990. During his tenure, the Company's loan portfolio grew from $360 million, with lending operations primarily in the southwest Missouri region, to $3.8 billion with lending operations in eight states. Mr. Mitchem and the Company began planning for his pending retirement more than a year ago to ensure a smooth management transition. At that time, the Company restructured the lending division to better reflect the Company's size and scope. The lending division now has two separate areas of responsibility - loan production led by John Bugh and credit administration led by Kevin Baker. Mr. Bugh and Mr. Baker are long-term Great Southern lenders, who each have more than 27 years of banking experience.\nEffect of Federal Laws and Regulations\nGeneral. Federal legislation and regulation significantly affect the operations of the Company and the Bank, and have increased competition among commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking enterprises and other financial institutions. In particular, the capital requirements and operations of regulated banking organizations such as the Company and the Bank have been and will be subject to changes in applicable statutes and regulations from time to time, which changes could, under certain circumstances, adversely affect the Company or the Bank.\nSignificant Legislation Impacting the Financial Services Industry. On July 21, 2010, sweeping financial regulatory reform legislation entitled the \"Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act\" (the \"Dodd-Frank Act\") was signed into law. The Dodd-\nFrank Act implements far-reaching changes across the financial regulatory landscape, including provisions that, among other things, centralize responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating a new agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, with broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks, require new capital rules (discussed below), change the assessment base for federal deposit insurance, repeal the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits, amend the account balance limit for federal deposit insurance protection, and increase the authority of the Federal Reserve Board to examine the Company and its non-bank subsidiaries.\nMany aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to rulemaking and will take effect over a number of years, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on the Company and the financial services industry more generally. Provisions in the legislation that affect deposit insurance assessments and payment of interest on demand deposits could increase the costs associated with deposits. Provisions in the legislation that require revisions to the capital requirements of the Company and the Bank could require the Company and the Bank to seek additional sources of capital in the future.\nA provision of the Dodd-Frank Act, commonly referred to as the \"Durbin Amendment,\" directed the FRB to analyze the debit card payments system and fix the interchange rates based upon their estimate of actual costs. The FRB has established the interchange rate for all debit transactions for issuers with over $10 billion in assets at $0.21 per transaction. An additional five basis points of the transaction amount and an additional $0.01 may be collected by the issuer for fraud prevention and recovery, provided the issuer performs certain actions. The Bank is currently exempt from the rule on the basis of asset size.\nNew Capital Rules. The federal banking agencies have adopted new regulatory capital rules that substantially amend the risk-based capital rules applicable to the Bank and the Company. The new rules implement the \"Basel III\" regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. \"Basel III\" refers to various documents released by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. For the Company and the Bank, the general effective date of the new rules was January 1, 2015, and, for certain provisions, various phase-in periods and later effective dates apply. The chief features of the new rules are summarized below.\nThe new rules refine the definitions of what constitutes regulatory capital and add a new regulatory capital element, common equity Tier 1 capital. The minimum capital ratios are (i) a common equity Tier 1 (\"CET1\") risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6%; (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 8%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. In addition to the minimum capital ratios, the new rules include a capital conservation buffer, under which a banking organization must have CET1 more than 2.5% above each of its minimum risk-based capital ratios in order to avoid restrictions on paying dividends, repurchasing shares, and paying certain discretionary bonuses. The new capital conservation buffer requirement began phasing in beginning on January 1, 2016 when a buffer greater than 0.625% of risk-weighted assets was required, which amount will increase an equal amount each year until the buffer requirement of greater than 2.5% of risk-weighted assets is fully implemented on January 1, 2019.\nEffective January 1, 2015, the new rules also revised the prompt corrective action framework, which is designed to place restrictions on insured depository institutions if their capital levels show signs of weakness. Under the new prompt corrective action requirements, insured depository institutions are required to meet the following in order to qualify as \"well capitalized:\" (i) a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.5%, (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%, (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10% and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5%, and must not be subject to an order, agreement or directive mandating a specific capital level.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 to the accompanying audited financial statements, which are included in Item 8 of this Report, for a description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective dates of adoption and expected effects on the Company's financial position and results of operations.\nComparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, total assets increased by $446.5 million to $4.55 billion. The increase was primarily attributable to the loan, premises and equipment and intangible assets related to the Fifth Third Bank branch acquisition, as well as an increase in loans originated by the Bank and cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by reductions in available-for-sale investment securities and the FDIC indemnification asset.\nNet loans increased $419.4 million to $3.76 billion at December 31, 2016. Outstanding and undisbursed balances of other residential (multi-family) loans increased $243.8 million, or 58.1%, commercial construction loans increased $179.8 million, or 29.9%, commercial real estate loans increased $143.4 million, or 13.7%, owner occupied one- to four-family residential loans increased $90.1 million, or 81.7%, and consumer auto loans increased $54.3 million, or 12.4%. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in net loans acquired through the FDIC-assisted transactions of $79.7 million, or 22.0%, primarily because of loan repayments.\nRelated to the loans purchased in the 2012, 2011 and 2009 FDIC-assisted transactions, the Company originally recorded indemnification assets which represented payments expected to be received from the FDIC through loss sharing agreements. As noted previously, the loss sharing agreements for Team Bank, Vantus Bank and Sun Security Bank, and the related remaining indemnification assets were terminated during 2016. The remaining balance of the FDIC indemnification is related to InterBank, and the total amount at December 31, 2016 was $13.1 million, a decrease of $11.0 million from $24.1 million at December 31, 2015, $21.1 million of which related to InterBank. The 2014 Valley Bank acquisition did not include a loss sharing agreement with the FDIC; therefore, no indemnification asset was recorded as part of the transaction.\nSecurities available for sale decreased $49.0 million, or 18.6%, as compared to December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to calls of municipal securities and U. S. government agency securities, sales of certain mortgage-backed securities, the sale of an investment in a managed equity fund held by the Company, and normal monthly payments received related to the portfolio of mortgage-backed securities, partially offset by the purchase of certain mortgage-backed securities. The Company was required to divest the investment it held in the managed equity fund as a result of regulations recently adopted by the Federal Reserve Board. Other investment securities were reduced because they were no longer needed for pledging for public fund deposits. The available-for-sale securities portfolio was 4.7% and 6.4% of total assets at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nCash and cash equivalents were $279.8 million at December 31, 2016, an increase of $80.6 million, or 40.5%, from $199.2 million at December 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2016, cash and cash equivalents increased primarily due to the cash received in the Fifth Third Bank transaction, sales of and payments received on available-for-sale securities, increases in deposits and the net proceeds of the issuance of $75.0 million of subordinated notes. This increase in cash and cash equivalents was partially offset by using a portion of the cash to fund loan growth.\nNet premises and equipment increased $10.9 million from December 31, 2015, primarily due to the branches acquired in the Fifth Third Bank transaction, partially offset by the transfer of branch properties closed in January 2016 to other real estate owned and the sale of two branches.\nThe Company's goodwill and other intangible assets totaled $12.5 million at December 31, 2016, an increase of $6.7 million, or 117.1%, compared to $5.8 million at December 31, 2015. The increase was due to the goodwill and core deposit intangible amounts recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2016 related to the Fifth Third Bank branch acquisition, as discussed above in the \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets\" section of this report.\nTotal liabilities increased $414.9 million from $3.71 billion at December 31, 2015 to $4.12 billion at December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in deposits and the issuance of subordinated notes. Deposits increased due to the deposits assumed in the Fifth Third Bank branch transaction, as well as growth in the Company's existing deposits and brokered deposits. In the year ended December 31, 2016, total deposit balances increased $408.6 million, or 12.5%. Transaction account balances increased $212.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, while retail certificates of deposit increased $156.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nFederal Home Loan Bank advances decreased $232.0 million, from $263.5 million at December 31, 2015 to $31.5 million at December 31, 2016. The decreased advances were replaced with overnight fed funds borrowings through the FHLBank based on funding needs. As such, short-term borrowings increased by $171.0 million, from $1.3 million at December 31, 2015 to $172.3 million at December 31, 2016. The overnight fed funds borrowing rate was lower than the one week or longer term rates for FHLBank advances, so the Company elected to utilize the overnight borrowings.\nIn August 2016, the Company issued $75 million of 5.25% fixed-to-floating rate Subordinated Notes due August 15, 2026. The notes were sold at par, resulting in net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and commissions and other issuance costs, of approximately $73.5 million. The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes.\nTotal stockholders' equity increased $31.6 million from $398.2 million at December 31, 2015 to $429.8 million at December 31, 2016. The Company recorded net income of $45.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and dividends declared on common stock were $12.2 million. Accumulated other comprehensive income decreased $4.1 million. The decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income resulted from decreases in the fair value of the Company's available-for-sale investment securities. In addition, total stockholders' equity increased $2.6 million due to stock option exercises.\nResults of Operations and Comparison for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nGeneral\nNet income decreased $1.2 million, or 2.5%, during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Net income was $45.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $46.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was due to an increase in non-interest expense of $6.1 million, or 5.3%, a decrease in net interest income of $5.3 million, or 3.1%, an increase in the provision for loan losses of $3.8 million, or 68.2% and an increase in provision for income taxes of $952,000, or 6.1%, partially offset by an increase in non-interest income of $14.9 million, or 109.9%. Net income available to common shareholders was $45.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $45.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nTotal Interest Income\nTotal interest income increased $824,000, or 0.4%, during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was due to a $1.6 million, or 0.9%, increase in interest income on loans, partially offset by an $819,000, or 11.5%, decrease in interest income on investment securities and other interest-earning assets. Interest income on loans increased in 2016 due to higher average balances on loans, partially offset by lower average rates of interest. Interest income from investment securities and other interest-earning assets decreased during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to lower average balances, partially offset by higher average rates of interest.\nInterest Income - Loans\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, interest income on loans increased due to higher average balances, partially offset by lower average interest rates. Interest income increased $21.8 million as the result of higher average loan balances, which increased from $3.24 billion during the year ended December 31, 2015, to $3.66 billion during the year ended December 31, 2016. The higher average balances were primarily due to organic loan growth, in addition to the loans obtained as part of the Fifth Third Bank branch acquisition. Interest income decreased $20.2 million as the result of lower average interest rates on loans. The average yield on loans decreased from 5.48% during the year ended December 31, 2015 to 4.89% during the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was due to lower overall loan rates, and a lower amount of accretion income in the current year resulting from the increases in expected cash flows to be received from the FDIC-acquired loan pools, which is discussed in Note 4 of the accompanying audited financial statements, which are included in Item 8 of this report.\nOn an on-going basis, the Company estimates the cash flows expected to be collected from the acquired loan pools. This cash flows estimate has increased, based on the payment histories and the collection of certain loans, thereby reducing loss expectations of certain loan pools, resulting in adjustments to be spread on a level-yield basis over the remaining expected lives of the loan pools. The loss sharing agreements for the Team Bank, Vantus Bank and Sun Security Bank transactions were terminated in April 2016, and the related indemnification assets were reduced to $-0- at that time. The Valley Bank transaction does not include a loss sharing agreement with the FDIC. Therefore, for these four acquisition transactions, there is no related indemnification asset. The entire amount of the discount adjustment has been and will be accreted to interest income over time with no offsetting impact to non-interest income. For the loan pools acquired in the InterBank transaction, the increases in expected cash flows also reduce the amount of expected reimbursements under the loss sharing agreement with the FDIC, which is recorded as an indemnification asset. Therefore, the expected indemnification asset has also been reduced, resulting in adjustments to be amortized on a comparable basis over the remainder of the loss sharing agreement or the remaining expected life of the loan pools, whichever is shorter. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the adjustments increased interest income by $16.4 million and $28.5 million, respectively, and decreased non-interest income by $7.0 million and $19.5 million, respectively. The net impact to pre-tax income was $9.4 million and $9.0 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the remaining accretable yield adjustment that will affect interest income is $6.3 million and the remaining adjustment to the indemnification assets related to InterBank, including the effects of the clawback liability, that will affect non-interest income (expense) is $(2.5) million. The $6.3 million of accretable yield adjustment relates to Team Bank, Vantus Bank, Sun Security Bank, InterBank and Valley Bank. The expense, as noted, is only related to InterBank, as there is no longer, nor will there be in the future, indemnification asset amortization expense related to Team Bank, Vantus Bank or Sun Security Bank due to the early termination of the remaining related loss sharing agreements for those transactions in April 2016. Of the remaining adjustments, we expect to recognize $4.3 million of interest income and $(1.7) million of non-interest income (expense) during 2017. Additional adjustments may be recorded in future periods from the FDIC-assisted acquisitions, as the Company continues to estimate expected cash flows from the acquired loan pools. Apart from the yield accretion, the average yield on loans was 4.44% during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 4.60% during the year ended December 31, 2015, as a result of loan pay-offs, normal amortization of higher-rate loans and new loans that were made at current lower market rates. Interest income also decreased due to significant interest recoveries in the prior year period, as discussed in the paragraph below.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company collected $891,000 on certain acquired loans which had previously not been expected to be collectible. These collections were recorded as interest income in 2015 and had a positive impact on the net interest margin in that year of approximately three basis points. As the loans were subject to loss sharing agreements at that time, 80% of the amounts collected, or $713,000, was recorded in 2015 and included in non-interest income under \"accretion (amortization) of income related to business acquisitions.\"\nInterest Income - Investments and Other Interest-earning Assets\nInterest income on investments and other interest-earning assets decreased $819,000 in the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Interest income decreased $1.9 million as a result of a decrease in average balances from $483.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, to $366.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. Average balances of securities decreased due to certain U. S. government agency securities and municipal securities being called, the sale of certain mortgage-backed securities, normal monthly payments received related to the portfolio of mortgage-backed securities, and the sale during the year of an investment in a managed equity fund held by the Company. Interest income increased $1.1 million due to an increase in average interest rates from 1.47% during the year ended December 31, 2015 to 1.72% during the year ended December 31, 2016, due to a higher portion of the investment portfolio in tax-exempt municipal bonds and higher market rates of interest on other interest-bearing deposits in financial institutions.\nThe Company's interest-earning deposits and non-interest-earning cash equivalents currently earn very low or no yield and therefore negatively impact the Company's net interest margin. At December 31, 2016, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $279.8 million compared to $199.2 million at December 31, 2015. See \"Net Interest Income\" for additional information on the impact of this interest activity.\nTotal Interest Expense\nTotal interest expense increased $6.1 million, or 38.3%, during the year ended December 31, 2016, when compared with the year ended December 31, 2015, due to an increase in interest expense on deposits of $3.9 million, or 28.7%, an increase in interest expense on the newly issued subordinated notes of $1.6 million, an increase in interest expense on short-term and structured repo borrowings of $1.1 million, or 1,649.2%, and an increase in interest expense on subordinated debentures issued to capital trust of $89,000, or 12.5%, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense on FHLBank advances of $493,000, or 28.9%.\nInterest Expense - Deposits\nInterest on demand deposits increased $832,000 due to an increase in average rates from 0.20% during the year ended December 31, 2015, to 0.26% during the year ended December 31, 2016. Interest on demand deposits increased $198,000 due to an increase in average balances from $1.40 billion in the year ended December 31, 2015, to $1.50 billion in the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in average balances of interest-bearing demand deposits was primarily a result of the deposits assumed as part of the Fifth Third Bank branch acquisition, partially offset by decreases in certain deposit types, such as public funds.\nInterest expense on time deposits increased $1.8 million as a result of an increase in average rates of interest from 0.85% during the year ended December 31, 2015, to 0.98% during the year ended December 31, 2016. Interest expense on time deposits increased $1.0 million due to an increase in average balances of time deposits from $1.26 billion during the year ended December 31, 2015, to $1.37 billion during the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in average balances of time deposits was primarily a result of increased balances of brokered deposits and time deposits opened through the Company's internet deposit acquisition channels. A large portion of the Company's certificate of deposit portfolio matures within six to eighteen months and therefore reprices fairly quickly; this is consistent with the portfolio over the past several years.\nInterest Expense - FHLBank Advances, Short-term Borrowings and Structured Repurchase Agreements, Subordinated Debentures Issued to Capital Trust and Subordinated Notes\nInterest expense on FHLBank advances decreased due to lower average balances, partially offset by higher average rates of interest. Interest expense on FHLBank advances decreased $1.4 million due to a decrease in average balances from $175.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, to $68.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily due to the paydown and partial replacement of short-term FHLBank advances with overnight fed funds borrowings from the FHLBank. Partially offsetting the decrease due to reduced average balances was an increase in interest expense of $919,000 due to an increase in average interest rates from 0.97% in the year ended December 31, 2015, to 1.78% in the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in the average rate was due to a change in the mix of advances compared to the prior year. Short-term advances with very low interest rates were utilized more significantly in the prior year, which caused the overall average rate to be lower. In the current year, the Company utilized more overnight borrowings from the FHLBank which are included in short-term borrowings, with the remaining balance of FHLBank advances being longer term at a higher rate.\nInterest expense on short-term borrowings and repurchase agreements increased $996,000 due to average rates that increased from 0.03% in the year ended December 31, 2015, to 0.35% in the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was due to a change in the mix of borrowings in the current period, during which overnight fed funds borrowings from the FHLBank were increased, which are at a higher interest rate than customer repurchase agreements. Interest expense on short-term borrowings and repurchase agreements increased $76,000 due to an increase in average balances from $192.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, to $327.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, which is primarily due to an increase in short-term borrowings from the FHLBank.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, interest expense on subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts increased $168,000 due to higher average interest rates. The average interest rate was 2.48% in 2015, compared to 3.12% in 2016. The increase in the interest rate resulted from the amortization of the cost of interest rate caps the Company purchased in 2013 to limit the interest rate risk from rising LIBOR rates related to the Company's subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts. Interest expense on subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts decreased $79,000 due to a decrease in average balances from $28.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $25.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. The average balance decreased because the Company redeemed $5.0 million of its subordinated debentures issued to capital trust during 2015. The remaining debentures are variable-rate debentures which bear interest at an average rate of three-month LIBOR plus 1.60%, adjusting quarterly. The average interest rate will continue to be higher than this until the third quarter of 2017 as a result of the amortization of the cost of the interest rate cap.\nIn August 2016, the Company issued $75 million of 5.25% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due August 15, 2026. The notes were sold at par, resulting in net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and commissions and other issuance costs, of approximately $73.5 million. Interest expense on the subordinated notes for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $1.6 million.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased $5.3 million to $163.1 million compared to $168.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net interest margin was 4.05% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 4.53% in 2015, a decrease of 48 basis points. In both years, the Company's net interest income and margin have been significantly impacted by the increases in expected cash flows to be received from the FDIC-acquired loan pools and the resulting increase to accretable yield, which was discussed previously in \"Interest Income - Loans\" and is discussed in Note 4 of the accompanying audited financial statements, which are included in Item 8 of this Report. The positive impact of these changes on the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were increases in interest income of $16.4 million and $28.5 million, respectively, and increases in net interest margin of 41 basis points and 77 basis points, respectively. Excluding the positive impact of the additional yield accretion, net interest margin decreased 12 basis points during the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in net interest margin was primarily due to a decrease in average interest rate on loans (primarily due to decreased interest income on loans acquired in the FDIC-assisted transactions) and an increase in the average interest rate on time deposits and borrowings, partially offset by an increase in the average interest rate on investment securities.\nThe Company's overall interest rate spread decreased 51 basis points, or 11.5%, from 4.44% during the year ended December 31, 2015, to 3.93% during the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was due to a 36 basis point decrease in the weighted average yield on interest-earning assets and a 15 basis point increase in the weighted average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. In comparing the two years, the yield on loans decreased 59 basis points while the yield on investment securities and other interest-earning assets increased 25 basis points. The rate paid on deposits increased 10 basis points, the rate paid on FHLBank advances increased 81 basis points, the rate paid on short-term borrowings increased 32 basis points and the rate paid on subordinated debentures issued to capital trust increased 64 basis points. In addition, the new subordinated notes paid interest at an average rate of 553 basis points.\nFor additional information on net interest income components, refer to the \"Average Balances, Interest Rates and Yields\" table in this Report.\nProvision for Loan Losses and Allowance for Loan Losses\nManagement records a provision for loan losses in an amount it believes sufficient to result in an allowance for loan losses that will cover current net charge-offs as well as risks believed to be inherent in the loan portfolio of the Bank. The amount of provision charged against current income is based on several factors, including, but not limited to, past loss experience, current portfolio mix, actual and potential losses identified in the loan portfolio, economic conditions, and internal as well as external reviews. The levels of non-performing assets, potential problem loans, loan loss provisions and net charge-offs fluctuate from period to period and are difficult to predict.\nWeak economic conditions, higher inflation or interest rates, or other factors may lead to increased losses in the portfolio and/or requirements for an increase in loan loss provision expense. Management maintains various controls in an attempt to limit future losses, such as a watch list of possible problem loans, documented loan administration policies and a loan review staff to review the quality and anticipated collectability of the portfolio. Additional procedures provide for frequent management review of the loan portfolio based on loan size, loan type, delinquencies, financial analysis, on-going correspondence with borrowers and problem loan work-outs. Management determines which loans are potentially uncollectible, or represent a greater risk of loss, and makes additional provisions to expense, if necessary, to maintain the allowance at a satisfactory level.\nThe provision for loan losses increased $3.8 million, to $9.3 million, during the year ended December 31, 2016, when compared with the year ended December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016, the allowance for loan losses was $37.4 million, a decrease of $749,000 from December 31, 2015. Total net charge-offs were $10.0 million and $5.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Excluding those related to loans covered by loss sharing agreements, six relationships made up $5.5 million of the total $10.0 million in net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2016. Gross charge-offs for the year were partially offset by recoveries, including recoveries on two separate relationships totaling $1.1 million, which had previously been charged off. During the year ended December 31, 2016, $3.8 million of the $10.0 million of net charge-offs were in the consumer auto category. General market conditions and unique circumstances related to individual borrowers and projects contributed to the level of provisions and charge-offs. As properties were categorized as potential problem loans, non-performing loans or foreclosed assets, evaluations were made of the values of these assets with corresponding charge-offs as appropriate.\nAt December 31, 2016, loans acquired in the InterBank FDIC-assisted transaction were covered by a loss sharing agreement between the FDIC and Great Southern Bank, which affords Great Southern Bank at least 80% protection from losses in the acquired portfolio of loans. The FDIC loss sharing agreement is subject to limitations on the types of losses covered and the length of time losses are covered and is conditioned upon the Bank complying with its requirements in the agreement with the FDIC. These limitations are described in detail in Note 4 of the accompanying financial statements, which are included in Item 8 of this report. In April 2016, the loss sharing agreements for Team Bank, Vantus Bank and Sun Security Bank were terminated. Loans acquired from the FDIC related to Valley Bank did not have a loss sharing agreement. All acquired loans were grouped into pools based on common characteristics and were recorded at their estimated fair values, which incorporated estimated credit losses at the acquisition date. These loan pools are systematically reviewed by the Company to determine the risk of losses that may exceed those identified at the time of the acquisition. Techniques used in determining risk of loss are similar to those used to determine the risk of loss for the legacy Great Southern Bank portfolio, with most focus being placed on those loan pools which include the larger loan relationships and those loan pools which exhibit higher risk characteristics. Review of the acquired loan portfolio also includes meetings with customers, review of financial information and collateral valuations to determine if any additional losses are apparent.\nThe allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans, excluding acquired covered and non-covered loans, was 1.04% and 1.20% at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover losses inherent in the Company's loan portfolio at December 31, 2016, based on recent reviews of the Company's loan portfolio and current economic conditions. If economic conditions were to deteriorate or management's assessment of the loan portfolio were to change, it is possible that additional loan loss provisions would be required, thereby adversely affecting future results of operations and financial condition.\nNon-performing Assets\nFormer TeamBank, Vantus Bank, Sun Security Bank and InterBank non-performing assets, including foreclosed assets and potential problem loans, are not included in the totals or in the discussion of non-performing loans, potential problem loans and foreclosed assets below as they are, or were, subject to loss sharing agreements with the FDIC, which cover at least 80% of principal losses that may be incurred in these portfolios for the applicable terms under the agreements. In addition, these assets were initially recorded at their estimated fair values as of their acquisition dates. The overall performance of the loan pools acquired in 2009, 2011 and 2012 in FDIC-assisted transactions has been better than original expectations as of the acquisition dates. Former Valley Bank loans are also excluded from the totals and the discussion of non-performing loans, potential problem loans and foreclosed assets below, although they are not covered by a loss sharing agreement. Former Valley Bank loans are accounted for in pools and were recorded at their fair value at the time of the acquisition; therefore, these loan pools are analyzed rather than the individual loans.\nAs previously discussed, the remaining loss sharing agreements for Team Bank, Vantus Bank and Sun Security Bank were terminated in April 2016. Loss sharing agreements covering single-family loans and foreclosed assets and non-single-family loans and foreclosed assets related to the Inter Savings Bank FDIC-assisted acquisition are still in place in accordance with their contractual terms.\nAs a result of changes in balances and composition of the loan portfolio, changes in economic and market conditions that occur from time to time, and other factors specific to a borrower's circumstances, the level of non-performing assets will fluctuate.\nNon-performing assets, excluding FDIC-covered and formerly covered non-performing assets and other FDIC-assisted acquired assets, at December 31, 2016, were $39.3 million, a decrease of $4.7 from $44.0 million at December 31, 2015. Non-performing assets, excluding FDIC-covered and formerly covered non-performing assets and other FDIC-assisted acquired assets, as a percentage of total assets were 0.86% at December 31, 2016, compared to 1.07% at December 31, 2015.\nCompared to December 31, 2015, non-performing loans decreased $2.5 million to $14.1 million at December 31, 2016, and foreclosed assets decreased $2.1 million to $25.2 million at December 31, 2016. Non-performing commercial real estate loans comprised $4.4 million, or 31.3%, of the total of $14.1 million of non-performing loans at December 31, 2016. The majority of the decrease in the commercial real estate category was due to one relationship where the notes were sold and the loans paid off after charge-offs of $2.0 million during 2016. Another relationship totaling $982,000 was transferred to foreclosed assets. In addition, $3.1 million of the transfers to foreclosed assets in the commercial real estate category and approximately $670,000 of the charge-offs were related to another relationship. Non-performing commercial business loans were $3.1 million, or 21.9%, of total non-performing loans at December 31, 2016. The increase in non-performing commercial business loans was primarily due to the addition of one relationship in 2016. Non-performing consumer loans were $2.6 million, or 18.7%, of total non-performing loans at December 31, 2016. Non-performing one-to four-family residential loans comprised $2.0 million, or 13.9%, of the total non-performing loans at December 31, 2016. Non-performing land development loans were $1.7 million, or 12.2%, of total non-performing loans at December 31, 2016. The increase in non-performing land development loans was primarily due to the addition of one relationship in 2016.\nNon-performing Loans. Activity in the non-performing loans category during the year ended December 31, 2016, was as follows:\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Beginning\nBalance,\nJanuary 1\n</td> <td>

year. The largest relationship in this category, which was added prior to 2016, totaled $1.7 million, or 38.5% of the total category, and is collateralized by a theatre property in Branson, Mo. One relationship in this category, which had a balance of $6.5 million at December 31, 2015, had $2.0 million in charge-offs and $5.1 million in payments (net of operating funds advanced) during the year. The relationship was collateralized by three operating long-term health care facilities in Missouri. These related notes were sold during 2016 for payment of the amount of the remaining balances after the charge-offs, resulting in a balance of zero at December 31, 2016. During 2016, $3.1 million of the transfers to foreclosed assets in the commercial real estate category and approximately $670,000 of the charge-offs were related to another relationship. This relationship is secured by property located in the Branson, Mo., area, and includes a lakefront resort, marina and related amenities, condominiums and lots. In addition to those relationships already discussed, $3.8 million of the transfers to foreclosed assets in the commercial real estate category during the year related to three additional relationships. The non-performing commercial business category included five loans, four of which were added during 2016. The largest loan in this category, which was added in 2016, totaled $3.0 million, or 95.6% of the total category, and is secured by the borrower's interest in a condo project in Branson, Mo. The Bank's lending involvement with this project dates back to 2005. This project had experienced some performance difficulties in the past and a new borrower became involved in this project during 2013. The non-performing one- to four-family residential category included 38 loans, 27 of which were added during 2016. The non-performing land development category included two loans. The largest loan in this category, which was originated in 2007, totaled $1.6 million, or 95.1% of the total category, and was collateralized by land in the St. Louis, Mo. area. The non-performing consumer category included 188 loans, 174 of which were added during 2016.\nForeclosed Assets. Of the total $32.7 million of other real estate owned at December 31, 2016, $1.4 million represents the fair value of foreclosed assets covered by FDIC loss sharing agreements, $316,000 represents the fair value of foreclosed assets previously covered by FDIC loss sharing agreements, $2.0 million represents foreclosed assets related to Valley Bank and not covered by loss sharing agreements, $9,000 represents other repossessed assets related to acquired loans, and $3.7 million represents properties which were not acquired through foreclosure, including former branch locations that have been closed and are held for sale and land which\nwas acquired for a potential branch location . The acquired loss share covered and non-covered foreclosed and other assets acquired in the FDIC-assisted transactions and the properties not acquired through foreclosure are not included in the following table and discussion of other real estate owned. Because sales of foreclosed properties exceeded additions, total foreclosed assets decreased. Activity in foreclosed assets during the year ended December 31, 2016, was as follows:\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Beginning\nBalance,\nJanuary 1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Additions\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Proceeds\nfrom Sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Capitalized\nCosts\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> ORE Expense\nWrite-Downs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Ending\nBalance,\nDecember 31\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (In Thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> One- to four-family construction\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subdivision construction\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7,016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (362\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (294\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,360\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Land development\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12,133\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1,247\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10,886\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial construction\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> One- to four-family residential\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,375\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (435\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (200\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,217\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other residential\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,150\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1,252\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (90\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial real estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,608\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7,094\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (6,170\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (691\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,841\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial business\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,109\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 13,332\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (12,450\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,991\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 27,391\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,903\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (21,916\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,275\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,249\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2016, the land development category of foreclosed assets included 22 properties, the largest of which was located in northwest Arkansas and had a balance of $1.4 million, or 12.6% of the total category. Of the total dollar amount in the land development category of foreclosed assets, 39.1% and 33.1% was located in the Branson, Mo. area and in the northwest Arkansas area, respectively, including the largest property previously mentioned. The subdivision construction category of foreclosed assets included 27 properties, the largest of which was located in the Springfield, Mo. metropolitan area and had a balance of $1.2 million, or 19.4% of the total category. Of the total dollar amount in the subdivision construction category of foreclosed assets, 29.4% and 19.4% is located in Branson, Mo. and Springfield, Mo., respectively, including the largest property previously mentioned. The commercial real estate category of foreclosed assets included six properties. The largest relationship in the commercial real estate category, which includes two properties which were added during 2016, totaled $1.5 million, or 39.6% of the total category, and is made up of commercial retail property in Texas and Georgia, which was previously in non-performing loans. The second largest relationship in the commercial real estate category, which was added during 2016, totaled $1.3 million, or 33.3% of the total category, and is a hotel located in the western United States, which was previously in non-performing loans. The $6.2 million in sales in the commercial real estate category of foreclosed assets was primarily from three properties. Sales of $2.1 million related to a property which is located in southeast Missouri and was added in 2015. Sales of $2.9 million related to a property located in the Branson, Mo., area, and included a lakefront resort, marina and related amenities, condominiums and lots. Sales of $982,000 related to a motel property located in Springfield, Mo. The one-to four-family residential category of foreclosed assets included nine properties, of which the largest relationship, with one property in the southwest Missouri area, had a balance of $421,000, or 34.6% of the total category. Of the total dollar amount in the one-to- four-family category of foreclosed assets, 44.4% is located in the Branson, Mo., area. The other residential category of foreclosed assets included five properties, four of which were part of the same condominium community, located in Branson, Mo. and had a balance of $694,000, or 72.7% of the total category. The sales of $1.3 million in the other residential category were from six additional properties that were part of the same condominium community which were sold during 2016. The larger amount of additions and sales under consumer loans are due to a higher volume of repossessions of automobiles, which generally are subject to a shorter repossession process. Compared to previous years, in 2016 the Company experienced increased levels of delinquencies and repossessions in consumer loans, primarily indirect used automobile loans.\nPotential Problem Loans. Potential problem loans decreased $5.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, from $12.8 million at December 31, 2015 to $7.0 million at December 31, 2016. This decrease was due to $6.0 million in loans transferred to the non-performing category, $2.6 million in loans removed from potential problem loans due to improvements in the credits, $2.2 million in charge-offs, $65,000 in loans transferred to foreclosed assets, and $3.4 million in payments on potential problem loans, partially offset by the addition of $8.5 million of loans to potential problem loans. Potential problem loans are loans which management has identified through routine internal review procedures as having possible credit problems that may cause the borrowers difficulty in complying with current repayment terms. These loans are not reflected in non-performing assets, but are considered in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Activity in the potential problem loans category during the year ended December 31, 2016, was as follows:\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Beginning\nBalance,\nJanuary 1\n</td> <td>

The largest loan in this category, which was added prior to 2016 and is collateralized by property in the Branson, Mo., area, totaled $3.8 million, or 92.9% of the total category. The commercial real estate category of potential problem loans included four loans, all of which were added prior to 2016. The largest relationship in this category contains two loans, with a total balance of $1.3 million, or 63.4% of the commercial real estate category. This relationship is collateralized by commercial entertainment property and other property in Branson, Mo. Two relationships made up $4.5 million in transfers to non-performing assets and $1.8 million in charge-offs in the commercial real estate category during 2016. These relationships are discussed above under non-performing loans. Of the $1.4 million in payments in this category, 95% was related to one loan, which was paid in full during 2016. The other residential category of potential problem loans has a balance of zero at December 31, 2016. During the year, payment was received in full on one loan which was previously included in the other residential category of potential problem loans totaling $2.0 million. This loan was to the same borrower that was referenced above in the land development category.\nNon-Interest Income\nNon-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $28.5 million compared with $13.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of $14.9 million, or 109.9 %, was primarily the result of the following items:\nAmortization of income related to business acquisitions: The net amortization expense related to business acquisitions was reduced to $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2016, consisted of the following items: $5.8 million of amortization expense related to the changes in cash flows expected to be collected from the FDIC-covered loan portfolios, $584,000 of impairment to certain indemnification assets and $1.4 million of amortization of the clawback liability. The impairment of the indemnification asset was recorded pursuant to the expected loss on the FDIC loss share termination agreements that occurred in April 2016, as discussed in the Company's March 31, 2016 Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Partially offsetting the expense was income from the accretion of the discount related to the indemnification asset for the InterBank acquisition of $896,000.\nNet realized gains on sales of available-for-sale securities: During 2016, the Company sold an investment held at the holding company level for a gain of $2.7 million. This investment, the original amount of which was $1.0 million, was made in a managed equity fund. The Company was required to divest this investment as a result of recent regulations enacted by the Federal Reserve Board. There were no material gains on sales of investments in 2015.\nService charges and ATM fees: Service charges and ATM fees increased $1.8 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to the additional accounts acquired in the Fifth Third Bank transaction in January 2016, which have had high levels of debit card activity, and overall higher levels of point-of-sale card activity.\nOther income: Other income decreased $918,000 compared to the prior year. During 2015, the Company recorded a $1.1 million gain when it redeemed the trust preferred securities previously issued by Great Southern Capital Trust III at a discount. Also in 2015,\nthe Company sold a banking center building in Nebraska at a net gain of $671,000. In addition, during 2015, the Company recognized a $300,000 gain on the sale of a non-marketable investment. The Company recognized a $257,000 gain on the sale of the Thayer, Mo., branch and deposits during the first quarter of 2016 and a $110,000 gain was recognized on the sale of the Buffalo, Mo., branch and deposits during the first quarter of 2016. In addition, in 2016, a gain of $238,000 was recognized on sales of fixed assets unrelated to the branch sales.\nNon-Interest Expense\nTotal non-interest expense increased $6.0 million, or 5.3%, from $114.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, to $120.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. The Company's efficiency ratio for the year ended December 31, 2016 was 62.86%, slightly higher than the 62.85% in 2015. The 2016 ratio was negatively affected by the increase in non-interest expense and the decrease in net interest income, offset by an increase in non-interest income. The Company's ratio of non-interest expense to average assets decreased from 2.81% for the year ended December 31, 2015, to 2.76% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in the current year ratio was due to the increase in average assets in 2016 compared to 2015, partially offset by the increase in non-interest expense. Average assets for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased $303.4 million, or 7.5%, from the year ended December 31, 2015. The following were key items related to the increase in non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015:\nFifth Third Bank branch acquisition expenses: The Company incurred approximately $1.4 million of expenses during 2016 related to the acquisition of certain branches of Fifth Third Bank, versus approximately $482,000 in acquisition related expenses in the prior year. Those expenses for 2016 (net of prior year expense, if applicable), included approximately $317,000 of legal, audit and other professional fees expense, approximately $294,000 of computer license and support expense, approximately $436,000 in charges to replace former Fifth Third Bank customer checks with Great Southern Bank checks, and approximately $54,000 of travel, meals and other expenses related to the transaction and similar costs incurred during the year. A number of these increases are discussed in the related categories below.\nSalaries and employee benefits: Salaries and employee benefits increased $1.7 million over the prior year period. Salaries increased due to additional employee costs related to the branches acquired from Fifth Third Bank during the first quarter of 2016 ($2.3 million during 2016), which was partially offset by the reduction in expenses related to the 16 banking centers which were closed or sold during the first quarter of 2016 ($1.7 million during the prior year). The remaining increase was due to increased staffing due to growth in lending and other operational areas.\nExpense on foreclosed assets: Expense on foreclosed assets increased $1.6 million compared to the prior year due to expenses and valuation write-downs of foreclosed assets, and the loss on final disposition of certain assets during the current year. During 2016, expenses and loss on final disposition of two related properties totaling $320,000 were incurred. In addition, approximately $912,000 in valuation write-downs, primarily related to these two properties, were taken during 2016. Collection expenses and losses on sales of non-real estate assets (primarily automobiles) increased $652,000 in 2016 compared to 2015. The Company has increased its consumer lending, primarily in indirect automobile lending, significantly in the past few years. The Company does not currently expect significant increases in this type of lending in future periods.\nOther operating expenses: Other operating expenses increased $1.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015. Of this amount, $436,000 relates to check charges to replace Fifth Third customer checks as part of the acquisition in the first quarter of 2016. There was also increased expense due to higher levels of debit card and check fraud losses in 2016. These losses totaled $1.9 million in 2016 compared to $619,000 in 2015. A large portion of the increase related to debit card fraud that resulted from a data security breach at a national retail merchant which operates stores in many of our markets, affecting some of our debit card customers who transacted business with the merchant. The losses incurred by the Company resulted from regulatory requirements that banks reimburse debit card customers for unauthorized transactions. In regard to this particular merchant breach, we currently believe that further loss exposure will not be significant.\nLegal, audit and other professional fees: Legal, audit and other professional fees increased $478,000 from the prior year due to legal and professional fees related to the Fifth Third transaction, legal fees related to the resolution of two large non-performing loan relationships, and increased audit and accounting fees.\nSupplies expense: Supplies expense increased $375,000 compared to the prior year primarily due to approximately $318,000 of one-time costs incurred to stock a supply of chip-enabled debit cards. In October 2016, the Company began mass issuing chip-enabled debit cards to its deposit customer base.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe Company's effective tax rate was 26.7% and 25.1% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which was lower than the statutory federal tax rate of 35%, due primarily to the utilization of certain investment tax credits and to tax-exempt investments and tax-exempt loans which reduced the Company's effective tax rate. In future periods, the Company expects its effective tax rate typically will be 26-28% of pre-tax net income, assuming it continues to maintain or increase its use of investment tax credits and maintain or increase its pre-tax net income. The Company's effective tax rate may fluctuate as it is impacted by the level and timing of the Company's utilization of tax credits and the level of tax-exempt investments and loans and the overall level of pretax income.\nAverage Balances, Interest Rates and Yields\nThe following table presents, for the periods indicated, the total dollar amount of interest income from average interest-earning assets and the resulting yields, as well as the interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities, expressed both in dollars and rates, and the net interest margin. Average balances of loans receivable include the average balances of non-accrual loans for each period. Interest income on loans includes interest received on non-accrual loans on a cash basis. Interest income on loans includes the amortization of net loan fees which were deferred in accordance with accounting standards. Fees included in interest income were $5.0 million, $4.4 million and $3.2 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Tax-exempt income was not calculated on a tax equivalent basis. The table does not reflect any effect of income taxes.\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Dec. 31, 2016(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n</td> <td>

increased $3.0 million, or 6.8%, during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Net income was $46.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $43.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was due to an increase in net interest income of $793,000, or 0.5% and a decrease in non-interest expense of $6.5 million, or 5.4%, partially offset by an increase in provision for income taxes of $1.8 million, or 13.2%, an increase in the provision for loan losses of $1.4 million, or 33.0% and a decrease in non-interest income of $1.2 million, or 7.8%. Non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2014 included a gain recognized on business acquisition of $10.8 million. Net income available to common shareholders was $45.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $43.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nTotal Interest Income\nTotal interest income increased $989,000, or 0.5%, during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was due to a $4.7 million, or 2.7%, increase in interest income on loans, partially offset by a $3.7 million, or 34.1%, decrease in interest income on investments and other interest-earning assets. Interest income on loans increased in 2015 due to higher average balances on loans, partially offset by lower average rates of interest. Interest income from investment securities and other interest-earning assets decreased during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to lower average balances. The lower average balances of investments were primarily due to the sale of certain mortgage-backed securities, and as a result of management's decision to not reinvest mortgage-backed securities' monthly cash flows and proceeds of sales back into investments, but to utilize the proceeds to fund a portion of our loan growth. Prepayments on the mortgages underlying these securities resulted in amortization of premiums\nwhich also reduced yields. Interest income on loans is affected by variations in the adjustments to accretable yield due to increases in expected cash flows to be received from the FDIC-acquired loan pools as discussed below in \"Interest Income - Loans\" and in Note 4 of the accompanying audited financial statements, which are included in Item 8 of this Report. In 2015, many higher yielding loans matured or were repaid. These loans were replaced with new loans that were generally at rates lower than those that repaid during the year, resulting in lower overall yields in the loan portfolio. Higher average balances of loans more than offset the lower interest yield on loans.\nInterest Income - Loans\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, interest income on loans increased due to higher average balances, partially offset by lower average interest rates. Interest income increased $26.1 million as a result of higher average loan balances which increased from $2.78 billion during the year ended December 31, 2014 to $3.24 billion during the year ended December 31, 2015. The higher average balances were primarily due to increases in commercial construction loans, consumer loans, commercial real estate loans, other residential loans and owner occupied one- to four-family residential loan categories. A portion of this average balance increase resulted from the Company acquiring $165.1 million in loans (net of discounts) as part of the Valley Bank FDIC-assisted transaction on June 20, 2014, the aggregate balance of which was $93.4 million (net of discounts) at December 31, 2015.\nInterest income decreased $21.4 million as the result of lower average interest rates on loans. The average yield on loans decreased from 6.20% during the year ended December 31, 2014 to 5.48% during the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was due to lower overall loan rates, and a lower amount of accretion income in the current year in conjunction with the fair value of the loan pools acquired in the FDIC-assisted transactions, as the additional yield accretion was lower in 2015 compared to 2014. On an on-going basis, the Company estimates the cash flows expected to be collected from the acquired loan pools. This cash flows estimate has increased, based on the payment histories and reduced loss expectations of the loan pools, resulting in adjustments to be spread on a level-yield basis over the remaining expected lives of the loan pools. For the loan pools acquired in the 2009, 2011 and 2012 FDIC-assisted transactions, the increases in expected cash flows also reduced the amount of expected reimbursements under the loss sharing agreements with the FDIC, which are recorded as indemnification assets. Therefore, the expected indemnification assets have also been reduced, resulting in adjustments to be amortized on a comparable basis over the remainder of the loss sharing agreements or the remaining expected life of the loan pools, whichever is shorter. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the adjustments increased interest income by $28.5 million and $35.0 million, respectively, and decreased non-interest income by $19.5 million and $28.7 million, respectively. The net impact to pre-tax income was $9.0 million and $6.2 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. As of December 31, 2015, the remaining accretable yield adjustment that will affect interest income is $12.0 million and the remaining adjustment to the indemnification assets, including the effects of the clawback liability related to InterBank, that will affect non-interest income (expense) is $(8.6) million. Of the remaining adjustments, we expect to recognize $9.1 million of interest income and $(6.0) million of non-interest income (expense) during 2016. Additional adjustments may be recorded in future periods from the FDIC-assisted transactions, as the Company continues to estimate expected cash flows from the acquired loan pools. Apart from the yield accretion, the average yield on loans was 4.60% for the year ended December 31, 2015, down from 4.94% for the year ended December 31, 2014, as a result of loan pay-offs and normal amortization of higher-rate loans and new loans that were made at current lower market rates.\nIn addition, the Company's net interest margin has been positively impacted by additional yield accretion recognized in conjunction with updated estimates of the fair value of the loan pools acquired in the June 2014 Valley Bank FDIC-assisted transaction. Beginning with the three months ended December 31, 2014, the cash flow estimates have increased for certain of the Valley Bank loan pools primarily based on significant loan repayments and also due to collection of certain loans, thereby reducing loss expectations on certain of the loan pools. This resulted in increased income that was spread on a level-yield basis over the remaining expected lives of these loan pools. The Valley Bank transaction does not include a loss sharing agreement with the FDIC. Therefore, there is no related indemnification asset. The entire amount of the discount adjustment will be accreted to interest income over time with no offsetting impact to non-interest income. The amount of the Valley Bank discount adjustment accreted to interest income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $5.7 million, and is included in the impact on net interest income/net interest margin amount discussed above. Based on current estimates, we anticipate recording additional interest income accretion of $3.0 million during 2016 related to these Valley Bank loan pools.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company collected $891,000 from customers on loans which had previously not been expected to be collectible. In accordance with the Company's accounting methodology, these collections were accounted for as increases in estimated cash flows and were recorded as interest income, thereby increasing net interest income and net interest margin. These collections related to acquired loans which were subject to loss sharing agreements with the FDIC; therefore, 80% of the amounts collected, or $713,000, was owed to the FDIC. This $713,000 of expense is included in non-interest income under \"accretion (amortization) of income related to business acquisitions.\"\nInterest Income - Investments and Other Interest-earning Assets\nInterest income on investments decreased $3.4 million as a result of a decrease in average balances from $495.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, to $330.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Average balances of securities decreased due to sales of certain mortgage-backed securities, normal monthly payments received related to the portfolio of mortgage-backed securities, and calls and maturities of maturities of municipal securities. The investment securities were reduced because they were no longer needed for pledging. Interest income on investments decreased $272,000 as a result of a decrease in average interest rates from 2.11% during the year ended December 31, 2014 to 2.06% during the year ended December 31, 2015. The majority of the Company's securities in 2014 and 2015 were mortgage-backed securities which are backed by hybrid ARMs that have fixed rates of interest for a period of time (generally one to ten years) and then adjust annually. The actual amount of securities that reprice and the actual interest rate changes on these securities are subject to the level of prepayments on these securities and the changes that actually occur in market interest rates (primarily treasury rates and LIBOR rates). Mortgage-backed securities are also subject to reduced yields due to more rapid prepayments in the underlying mortgages. As a result, premiums on these securities may be amortized against interest income more quickly, thereby reducing the yield recorded.\nInterest income on other interest-earning assets decreased $62,000 mainly due to lower average balances from $185.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, to $152.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Average balances of interest-earning deposits decreased primarily due to the use of excess liquidity to fund a portion of the Company's loan growth. The Company's interest-earning deposits and non-interest-earning cash equivalents currently earn very low or no yield and therefore negatively impact the Company's net interest margin. At December 31, 2015, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $199.2 million compared to $218.6 million at December 31, 2014. See \"Net Interest Income\" for additional information on the impact of this interest activity.\nTotal Interest Expense\nTotal interest expense increased $196,000, or 1.2%, during the year ended December 31, 2015, when compared with the year ended December 31, 2014, due to an increase in interest expense on deposits of $2.3 million, or 20.4% and an increase in interest expense on subordinated debentures issued to capital trust of $147,000, or 25.9%, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense on FHLBank advances of $1.2 million, or 41.3%, and a decrease in interest expense on short-term and structured repo borrowings of $1.0 million, or 94.1%.\nInterest Expense - Deposits\nInterest on demand deposits decreased $176,000 due to a decrease in average rates from 0.22% during the year ended December 31, 2014, to 0.20% during the year ended December 31, 2015. Interest on demand deposits decreased $54,000 due to a small decrease in average balances from $1.43 billion in the year ended December 31, 2014, to $1.40 billion in the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in average balances of interest-bearing demand deposits was primarily a result of a decrease in public funds deposits. Average noninterest-bearing demand balances increased from $535 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, to $542 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nInterest expense on time deposits increased $1.8 million due to an increase in average balances of time deposits from $1.04 billion during the year ended December 31, 2014, to $1.26 billion during the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in average balances of time deposits was primarily a result of increased balances of brokered deposits and time deposits opened through the Company's internet deposit acquisition channels. The increase in time deposit balances was also due to the deposits acquired in the Valley Bank transaction on June 20, 2014. Interest expense on time deposits increased $741,000 as a result of an increase in average rates of interest from 0.78% during the year ended December 31, 2014, to 0.85% during the year ended December 31, 2015. A large portion of the Company's certificate of deposit portfolio matures within six to eighteen months and therefore reprices fairly quickly; this is consistent with the portfolio over the past several years.\nInterest Expense - FHLBank Advances, Short-term Borrowings and Structured Repurchase Agreements and Subordinated Debentures Issued to Capital Trust\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, interest expense on FHLBank advances decreased due to lower average rates of interest, partially offset by slightly higher average balances. Interest expense on FHLBank advances decreased $1.3 million due to a decrease in average interest rates from 1.69% in the year ended December 31, 2014, to 0.97% in the year ended December 31, 2015. The significant decrease in the average rate was due to the repayment of $80 million of the Company's long-term higher-rate FHLBank advances in June 2014. As of December 31, 2015, $232 million of the Company's $264 million of total FHLBank advances are short-term advances with very low interest rates. Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in interest expense on FHLBank advances of $64,000 due to an increase in average balances from $172.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, to $175.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily due to additional short-term FHLBank advances obtained by the Company during 2015 to fund loan growth and for other short term funding needs.\nInterest expense on short-term and structured repo borrowings decreased $1.1 million due to a decrease in average rates on short-term borrowings from 0.58% in the year ended December 31, 2014, to 0.03% in the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company repaid $50 million of structured repurchase agreements in June 2014. As there were no higher-rate structured repurchase agreements during 2015, the average rate decreased significantly because the interest expense was all related to the lower-rate securities sold under repurchase agreements with customers. Partially offsetting that decrease, interest expense on short-term borrowings and structured repurchase agreements increased $18,000 due to an increase in average balances from $188.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, to $192.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, interest expense on subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts increased $189,000 due to higher average interest rates. The average interest rate was 1.83% in 2014, compared to 2.48% in 2015. The increase in the interest rate resulted from the amortization of the cost of interest rate caps the Company purchased in 2013 to limit the interest rate risk from rising LIBOR rates related to the Company's subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts. Interest expense on subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts decreased $42,000 due to a decrease in average balances from $30.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $28.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The average balance decreased because the Company redeemed $5.0 million of its subordinated debentures issued to capital trust during 2015. Additional information regarding this transaction is provided in Note 13 of the accompanying audited financial statements, which are included in Item 8 of this Report. The remaining debentures are variable-rate debentures which bear interest at an average rate of three-month LIBOR plus 1.60%, adjusting quarterly. The average interest rate will continue to be higher than this until the third quarter of 2017 as a result of the amortization of the cost of the interest rate cap.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $793,000 to $168.4 million compared to $167.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Net interest margin was 4.53% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 4.84% in 2014, a decrease of 31 basis points. The Company's net interest income and margin have been significantly impacted by additional yield accretion recognized in conjunction with updated estimates of the fair value of the loan pools acquired in the 2009, 2011 and 2012 FDIC-assisted transactions. The Company's margin was positively impacted in both years by the increases in expected cash flows to be received from the loan pools acquired in the FDIC-assisted transactions and the resulting increases to accretable yield which was discussed previously in \"Interest Income - Loans\" and is discussed in Note 4 of the accompanying audited financial statements, which are included in Item 8 of this Report. The impact of these changes on the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were increases in interest income of $28.5 million and $35.0 million, respectively, and increases in net interest margin of 77 basis points and 101 basis points, respectively. Excluding the positive impact of the additional yield accretion, net interest margin decreased 7 basis points during the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in net interest margin was primarily due to a decrease in average interest rate on loans and an increase in the average interest rate on time deposits.\nThe Company's overall interest rate spread decreased 30 basis points, or 6.3%, from 4.74% during the year ended December 31, 2014, to 4.44% during the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was due to a 33 basis point decrease in the weighted average yield on interest-earning assets, partially offset by a three basis point decrease in the weighted average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. In comparing the two years, the yield on loans decreased 72 basis points while the yield on investment securities and other interest-earning assets decreased 12 basis points. The rate paid on deposits increased six basis points, the rate paid on FHLBank advances decreased 72 basis points, the rate paid on short-term borrowings decreased 55 basis points and the rate paid on subordinated debentures issued to capital trust increased 65 basis points.\nFor additional information on net interest income components, refer to the \"Average Balances, Interest Rates and Yields\" table in this Report.\nProvision for Loan Losses and Allowance for Loan Losses\nThe provision for loan losses increased $1.4 million to $5.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, when compared with the year ended December 31, 2014. At December 31, 2015, the allowance for loan losses was $38.1 million, a decrease of $286,000 from December 31, 2014. Total net charge-offs were $5.8 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Excluding those related to loans covered by loss sharing agreements, five relationships made up $2.6 million of the total $5.8 million in net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2015. General market conditions and unique circumstances related to individual borrowers and projects also contributed to the level of provisions and charge-offs. As properties were categorized as potential problem loans, non-performing loans or foreclosed assets, evaluations were made of the values of these assets with corresponding charge-offs as appropriate.\nExcept for those loans acquired in the TeamBank and Vantus Bank transactions for which the loss sharing agreements have ended (i.e., non-single family real estate loans), loans acquired in the 2009, 2011 and 2012 FDIC-assisted transactions are covered by loss sharing agreements between the FDIC and Great Southern Bank which afford Great Southern Bank at least 80% protection from losses in the acquired portfolio of loans. The FDIC loss sharing agreements are subject to limitations on the types of losses covered and the length\nof time losses are covered and are conditioned upon the Bank complying with its requirements in the agreements with the FDIC. These limitations are described in detail in Note 4 of the accompanying audited financial statements, which are included in Item 8 of this Report. These acquired loans were grouped into pools based on common characteristics and were recorded at their estimated fair values, which incorporated estimated credit losses at the acquisition dates. These loan pools are systematically reviewed by the Company to determine the risk of losses that may exceed those identified at the time of the acquisition. Techniques used in determining risk of loss are similar to those used to determine the risk of loss for the legacy Great Southern Bank portfolio, with most focus being placed on those loan pools which include the larger loan relationships and those loan pools which exhibit higher risk characteristics. Review of the acquired loan portfolio also includes meetings with customers, review of financial information and collateral valuations to determine if any additional losses are apparent. Former Valley Bank loans, which were also acquired in an FDIC-assisted transaction, are accounted for in pools and were recorded at their fair value at the time of the acquisition as of June 20, 2014; therefore, these loan pools are analyzed rather than the individual loans.\nThe Bank's allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans, excluding loans covered by the FDIC loss sharing agreements, was 1.20% and 1.34% at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover losses inherent in the Company's loan portfolio at December 31, 2015, based on recent reviews of the Company's loan portfolio and current economic conditions. If economic conditions were to deteriorate or management's assessment of the loan portfolio were to change, it is possible that additional loan loss provisions would be required, thereby adversely affecting future results of operations and financial condition.\nNon-performing Assets\nFormer TeamBank, Vantus Bank, Sun Security Bank and InterBank non-performing assets, including foreclosed assets, are not included in the totals or in the discussion of non-performing loans, potential problem loans and foreclosed assets below as they are, or were, subject to loss sharing agreements with the FDIC, which cover at least 80% of principal losses that may be incurred in these portfolios for the applicable terms under the agreements. At December 31, 2015, there were no material non-performing assets that were previously covered, and are now not covered, under the TeamBank or Vantus Bank non-single-family loss sharing agreements. In addition, FDIC-supported TeamBank, Vantus Bank, Sun Security Bank and InterBank assets were initially recorded at their estimated fair values as of their acquisition dates of March 20, 2009, September 4, 2009, October 7, 2011, and April 27, 2012, respectively. The overall performance of the FDIC-covered loan pools acquired in 2009, 2011 and 2012 has been better than original expectations as of the acquisition dates. Former Valley Bank loans are also excluded from the totals and the discussion of non-performing loans, potential problem loans and foreclosed assets below, although they are not covered by a loss sharing agreement.\nThe loss sharing agreement for the non-single-family portion of the loans acquired in the TeamBank transaction ended on March 31, 2014. Any additional losses in that non-single-family portfolio will not be eligible for loss sharing coverage. At this time, the Company does not expect any material losses in this non-single-family loan portfolio, which totaled $16.2 million, net of discounts, at December 31, 2015.\nThe loss sharing agreement for the non-single-family portion of the loans acquired in the Vantus Bank transaction ended on September 30, 2014. Any additional losses in that non-single-family portfolio will not be eligible for loss sharing coverage. At this time, the Company does not expect any material losses in this non-single-family loan portfolio, which totaled $17.1 million, net of discounts, at December 31, 2015.\nAs a result of changes in balances and composition of the loan portfolio, changes in economic and market conditions that occur from time to time, and other factors specific to a borrower's circumstances, the level of non-performing assets will fluctuate.\nNon-performing assets, excluding FDIC-covered non-performing assets and other FDIC-assisted acquired assets, at December 31, 2015, were $44.0 million, an increase of $272,000 from $43.7 million at December 31, 2014. Non-performing assets, excluding FDIC-covered non-performing assets and other FDIC-assisted acquired assets, as a percentage of total assets were 1.07% at December 31, 2015, compared to 1.11% at December 31, 2014.\nCompared to December 31, 2014, non-performing loans increased $8.5 million to $16.6 million at December 31, 2015, and foreclosed assets decreased $8.1 million to $27.4 million at December 31, 2015. Non-performing commercial real estate loans comprised $13.5 million, or 81.4%, of the total of $16.6 million of non-performing loans at December 31, 2015. Non-performing one-to four-family residential loans comprised $1.4 million, or 8.2%, of the total non-performing loans at December 31, 2015. Non-performing consumer loans were $1.3 million, or 7.8%, of total non-performing loans at December 31, 2015. Non-performing commercial business loans were $288,000, or 1.7%, of total non-performing loans at December 31, 2015. Non-performing construction and land development loans were $139,000, or 0.8%, of total non-performing loans at December 31, 2015.\nNon-performing Loans.

potential problem loans during the current year and related to three relationships. The largest relationship in this category, which was transferred from potential problem loans to non-performing loans during the three months ended December 31, 2015, totaled $6.5 million, or 48.1% of the total category, and is collateralized by three operating long-term health care facilities in Missouri. This relationship with the Bank began in 2000 and has performed adequately until recently. A receiver was recently appointed to manage and stabilize the facilities. The second largest relationship in this category, which was also transferred from potential problem loans during the three months ended December 31, 2015, totaled $3.7 million, or 27.6%, of the total category, and is collateralized by property in the Branson, Mo., area, including a lakefront resort, marina and related amenities, condominiums and lots. This borrower has been in business for over 30 years and a bank customer since 1992. In 2015, the project experienced declining occupancy rates and entered bankruptcy in the latter part of 2015. Of the $1.5 million removed from non-performing commercial real estate loans during the year, $1.3 million was related to one loan, and was removed due to improvement in the credit and payment performance. The non-performing one- to four-family residential category included 27 loans, 16 of which were added during the year. The non-performing consumer category included 101 loans, 83 of which were added during the year.\nForeclosed Assets. Of the total $31.9 million of other real estate owned at December 31, 2015, $1.8 million represents the fair value of foreclosed assets covered by FDIC loss sharing agreements, $460,000 represents the fair value of foreclosed assets previously covered by FDIC loss sharing agreements, $995,000 represents foreclosed assets related to Valley Bank and not covered by loss sharing agreements, $25,000 represents other assets related to acquired loans, and $1.2 million represents properties which were not acquired through foreclosure. The foreclosed assets and other assets related to acquired loans and the properties not acquired through foreclosure are not included in the following table and discussion of foreclosed assets. Because sales of foreclosed properties exceeded additions, total foreclosed assets decreased.

Potential problem loans decreased $12.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, from $25.0 million at December 31, 2014 to $12.8 million at December 31, 2015. This decrease was due to $11.2 million in loans transferred to the non-performing category, $8.6 million in loans removed from potential problem loans due to improvements in the credits, $2.0 million in charge-offs, $157,000 in loans transferred to foreclosed assets, and $2.6 million in payments on potential problem loans, partially offset by the addition of $12.3 million of loans to potential problem loans. Potential problem loans are loans which management has identified through routine internal review procedures as having possible credit problems that may cause the borrowers difficulty in complying with current repayment terms. These loans are not reflected in non-performing assets, but are considered in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Activity in the potential problem loans category during the year ended December 31, 2015, was as follows:\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Beginning\nBalance,\nJanuary 1\n</td> <td>

were added during the current year. The largest relationship in this category, which was made up of five new loans added during the three months ended December 31, 2015, had a balance of $2.9 million, or 55.7% of the total category and is collateralized by various properties in the Branson, Mo., area., including commercial buildings, commercial land, residential lots and undeveloped land with clubhouse amenities and entertainment attractions. This relationship has been with the Bank for over 30 years. Of the $10.7 million of transfers to non-performing, $10.2 million were related to two relationships, which were discussed above in the non-performing loans section. All of the net charge-offs in the commercial real estate category related to these two relationships. The land development category of potential problem loans included one loan, which was added during a previous year and is collateralized by property in the Branson, Mo., area. The other residential category of potential problem loans included one loan which was added in a previous year, and is collateralized by properties located in the Branson, Mo., area. This loan was also to the same borrower that was referenced above in the land development category. The one- to four-family residential category of potential problem loans included 12 loans, two of which were added during the current year. The subdivision construction category of potential problem loans included three loans, two of which were added during the current year. Seven loans in this category were removed from potential problem loans during 2015, which included four loans to one borrower totaling $1.6 million. The loans were removed due to improvements in the credit and payment performance. The one-to four-family construction category of potential problem loans is zero at December 31, 2015, and three loans in this category, all of which were to the same borrower, were removed from potential problem loans during the year due to improvement in the borrower's financial performance. These loans were also to the same borrower that was referenced above in the loans which were removed from potential problem loans in the subdivision construction category.\nNon-Interest Income\nNon-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $13.6 million compared with $14.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease of $1.1 million, or 7.8%, was primarily the result of the following increases and decreases:\nInitial gain recognized on business acquisition: In 2014, the Company recognized a one-time gain of $10.8 million (pre-tax) on the FDIC-assisted acquisition of Valley Bank, which occurred on June 20, 2014.\nExcluding the gain referenced above, non-interest income increased $9.7 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily as a result of the following items:\nAmortization of income related to business acquisitions: The net amortization expense related to business acquisitions was $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $27.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2015, consisted of the following items: $18.0 million of amortization expense related to the changes in cash flows expected to be collected from the FDIC-covered loan portfolios and $1.6 million of amortization of the clawback liability. In addition, the Company collected amounts on various problem assets acquired from the FDIC totaling $892,000. Under the loss sharing agreements, 80% of these collected amounts must be remitted to the FDIC; therefore, the Company recorded a liability and related expense of $714,000. Partially offsetting the expense was income from the accretion of the discount related to the\nindemnification assets for the Sun Security Bank and InterBank acquisitions of $1.4 million. In addition, a charge-off on a loan pool which exceeded the remaining discount on the pool by $803,000 was recognized as a reduction to allowance for loan losses during the third quarter. The Bank expects to collect 80% of this amount as reimbursement from the FDIC, so income of $643,000 was recorded in non-interest income.\nService charges and ATM fees: Service charges and ATM fees increased $766,000 compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase in fee income from the additional accounts acquired in the Valley Bank transaction in June 2014.\nOther income: Other income increased $744,000 compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to a $1.1 million gain recognized when the Company redeemed the trust preferred securities previously issued by Great Southern Capital Trust III at a discount, as discussed in previous filings. This increase was offset by non-recurring debit card-related income of $1.0 million recognized during the 2014 period which was not repeated in the 2015 period. Other income increased $300,000 compared to the prior year due to a $300,000 gain recognized on the sale of a non-marketable investment.\nLate charges and fees on loans: Late charges and fees on loans increased $729,000 compared to the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to yield maintenance penalty payments received on 12 commercial loan prepayments, totaling $547,000 in 2015.\nNet realized gains on sales of available-for-sale securities: Gains on sales of available-for-sale securities decreased $2.1 million compared to the prior year. This was primarily due to the sale of securities in the prior year, which was not repeated in 2015. During 2014, the taxable municipal securities originally acquired in the Sun Security Bank acquisition were sold resulting in a gain of $1.2 million. All of the Company's Small Business Administration securities were sold in 2014, which produced a gain of $569,000. In addition, all of the mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations acquired in the Valley Bank acquisition were sold in 2014, and several additional securities were sold later in 2014, producing a gain of $227,000, and one municipal bond was sold at a gain of $95,000.\nNon-Interest Expense\nTotal non-interest expense decreased $6.5 million, or 5.4%, from $120.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, to $114.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company's efficiency ratio for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 62.85%, improving from 66.30% in 2014. The 2015 ratio was positively affected by the decrease in non-interest expense and the increase in net interest income, partially offset by a decrease in non-interest income. The Company's ratio of non-interest expense to average assets decreased from 3.16% for the year ended December 31, 2014, to 2.81% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in the current year ratio was primarily due to both the increase in average assets and the decrease in non-interest expense in 2015 compared to 2014. Average assets for the year ended December 31, 2015, increased $242.9 million, or 6.4%, from the year ended December 31, 2014. The following were key items related to the increase in non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014:\nOther Operating Expenses: Other operating expenses decreased $7.3 million, to $8.5 million, in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year primarily due to $7.4 million in prepayment penalties paid in 2014 as the Company elected to repay $130 million of its FHLB advances and structured repo borrowings prior to their maturity, which was not repeated in 2015.\nExpense on foreclosed assets: Expense on foreclosed assets decreased $3.1 million compared to the prior year primarily due to valuation write-downs of foreclosed assets during 2014 totaling $2.0 million. In addition, total foreclosed assets decreased from the prior year, further reducing the expenses.\nLegal, audit and other professional fees: Legal, audit and other professional fees decreased $1.2 million when compared to the prior year, primarily due to additional expenses in the prior year related to the Valley Bank acquisition, significant collection costs of a few large loans and foreclosed assets, as well as the reduction of the total amount of foreclosed assets in the current year compared to the prior year.\nPartially offsetting the decrease in non-interest expense was an increase in the following items:\nExpenses related to operations of new banking centers in 2015: The Company incurred approximately $245,000 and $144,000 of additional non-interest expenses during the year ended December 31, 2015, in connection with the operations of new banking centers in Overland Park, Kansas and Columbia, Missouri, respectively. The majority of these expenses related to salary and benefits and occupancy expenses.\nSalaries and employee benefits: Salaries and employee benefits increased $2.7 million over the prior year, primarily due to increased staffing due to growth in lending and other operational areas, as well as approximately $330,000 in retention payments and other acquisition-related salaries and benefits related to the Fifth Third Bank branch acquisition. In addition, the Company opened banking\ncenters in 2015 in Overland Park, Kansas and Columbia, Missouri, and operated the acquired Valley Bank for a full year in 2015 versus one-half year of operations in 2014.\nNet occupancy expense: Net occupancy expense increased $2.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014. In September 2015, the Company announced plans to consolidate operations of 16 banking centers into other nearby Great Southern banking center locations. The Company evaluated the carrying value of the affected premises (totaling approximately $7.5 million) to determine if any impairment of the value of these premises is warranted and has recorded a valuation allowance of $1.2 million related to certain affected premises, furniture, fixtures and equipment and leases in 2015. Occupancy expense also increased in 2015 as a result of the Valley Bank acquisition which occurred in June 2014, and due to the opening of the two branches in Overland Park and Columbia noted above.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nIn 2014, the Company elected to early-adopt FASB ASU No. 2014-01, which amends FASB ASC Topic 323, Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures. This Update impacted the Company's accounting for investments in flow-through limited liability entities which manage or invest in affordable housing projects that qualify for the low-income housing tax credit. The amendments in the Update permitted reporting entities to make an accounting policy election to account for their investments in qualified affordable housing projects using the proportional amortization method if certain conditions are met. Under the proportional amortization method, an entity amortizes the initial cost of the investment in proportion to the tax credits and other tax benefits received and recognizes the net investment performance in the income statement as a component of income tax expense (benefit). The Company has significant investments in such qualified affordable housing projects that meet the required conditions. The Company's adoption of this Update did not materially affect the Company's financial position or results of operations. There was no change in Net Income for the periods covered in this document and there was no cumulative effect adjustment to Retained Earnings.\nProvision for income taxes as a percentage of pre-tax income was 25.1% and 24.0% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which was lower than the statutory federal tax rate of 35%, due primarily to the effects of the tax credits utilized and to tax-exempt investments and tax-exempt loans which reduced the Company's effective tax rate. In future periods, the Company expects its effective tax rate typically will be 24-26% of pre-tax net income, assuming it continues to maintain or increase its use of investment tax credits. The Company's effective tax rate may fluctuate as it is impacted by the level and timing of the Company's utilization of tax credits and the level of tax-exempt investments and loans and the overall level of pretax income. At this time, the Company expects to continue to utilize a significant amount of tax credits in 2016.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity is a measure of the Company's ability to generate sufficient cash to meet present and future financial obligations in a timely manner through either the sale or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds through liability management. These obligations include the credit needs of customers, funding deposit withdrawals and the day-to-day operations of the Company. Liquid assets include cash, interest-bearing deposits with financial institutions and certain investment securities and loans. As a result of the Company's management of the ability to generate liquidity primarily through liability funding, management believes that the Company maintains overall liquidity sufficient to satisfy its depositors' requirements and meet its customers' credit needs. At December 31, 2016, the Company had commitments of approximately $142.0 million to fund loan originations, $781.8 million of unused lines of credit and unadvanced loans, and $26.4 million of outstanding letters of credit.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's fixed and determinable contractual obligations by payment date as of December 31, 2016. Additional information regarding these contractual obligations is discussed further in Notes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17 and 20 of the accompanying audited financial statements, which are included in Item 8 of this Report.\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Payments Due In:\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> One Year or\nLess\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Over One to\nFive\nYears\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Over Five\nYears\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (In Thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deposits without a stated maturity\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,192,504\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,192,504\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Time and brokered certificates of deposit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,036,958\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 443,944\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,824\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,484,726\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Federal Home Loan Bank advances\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 30,843\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 31,452\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Short-term borrowings\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 286,023\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 286,023\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subordinated debentures\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 25,774\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 25,774\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subordinated notes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 73,537\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 73,537\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,458\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,349\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dividends declared but not paid\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,073\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,073\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,550,220\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 445,511\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 103,707\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,099,438\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's primary sources of funds are customer deposits, FHLBank advances, other borrowings, loan repayments, unpledged securities, proceeds from sales of loans and available-for-sale securities and funds provided from operations. The Company utilizes particular sources of funds based on the comparative costs and availability at the time. The Company has from time to time chosen not to pay rates on deposits as high as the rates paid by certain of its competitors and, when believed to be appropriate, supplements deposits with less expensive alternative sources of funds.\nAt December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had these available secured lines and on-balance sheet liquidity:\nTable 105: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Federal Home Loan Bank line\n</td> <td> $551.0 million\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $505.5 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Federal Reserve Bank line\n</td> <td> 602.0 million\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 633.7 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest-Bearing and Non-Interest-Bearing\nDeposits\n</td> <td> 279.8 million\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 199.2 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unpledged Securities\n</td> <td> 50.7 million\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 59.8 million\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nStatements of Cash Flows. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company had positive cash flows from operating activities. The Company experienced negative cash flows from investing activities during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, and positive cash flows from investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2014. The Company experienced positive cash flows from financing activities during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, and negative cash flows from financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nCash flows from operating activities for the periods covered by the Statements of Cash Flows have been primarily related to changes in accrued and deferred assets, credits and other liabilities, the provision for loan losses, realized gains on the sale of investment securities and loans, depreciation and amortization, gains on the purchase of additional business units and the amortization of deferred loan origination fees and discounts (premiums) on loans and investments, all of which are non-cash or non-operating adjustments to operating cash flows. Net income adjusted for non-cash and non-operating items and the origination and sale of loans held-for-sale were the primary sources of cash flows from operating activities. Operating activities provided cash flows of $80.1 million, $71.4 million and $67.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, investing activities used cash of $198.1 million and $196.2 million, respectively, primarily due to the net increases and purchases of loans, partially offset by the net repayment or sales of investment securities. During the year ended December 31, 2014, investing activities provided cash of $35.9 million, primarily due to the cash received from the FDIC-assisted acquisitions and the net repayment or sales of investment securities, partially offset by increases in loans.\nChanges in cash flows from financing activities during the periods covered by the Statements of Cash Flows are primarily due to changes in deposits after interest credited, changes in FHLBank advances, changes in short-term borrowings and structured repurchase\nagreements, dividend payments to stockholders, issuance of subordinated notes (2016) and redemption of preferred stock (2015). Financing activities provided cash flows of $198.7 million and $105.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily due to increases in customer deposit balances, partially offset by net increases or decreases in various borrowings, dividend payments to stockholders, issuance of subordinated notes and redemption of preferred stock. Financing activities used cash flows of $112.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to reduction of customer deposit balances, net increases or decreases in various borrowings and dividend payments to stockholders.\nCapital Resources\nManagement continuously reviews the capital position of the Company and the Bank to ensure compliance with minimum regulatory requirements, as well as to explore ways to increase capital either by retained earnings or other means.\nAs of December 31, 2016, total stockholders' equity and common stockholders' equity were $429.8 million, or 9.4% of total assets, equivalent to a book value of $30.77 per common share. As of December 31, 2015, total stockholders' equity and common stockholders' equity were $398.2 million, or 9.7% of total assets, equivalent to a book value of $28.67 per common share. At December 31, 2016, the Company's tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 9.2% as compared to 9.6% at December 31, 2015.\nBanks are required to maintain minimum risk-based capital ratios. These ratios compare capital, as defined by the risk-based regulations, to assets adjusted for their relative risk as defined by the regulations. Under current guidelines, which became effective January 1, 2015, banks must have a minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.50%, a minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.00%, a minimum total risk-based capital ratio of 8.00%, and a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.00%. To be considered \"well capitalized,\" banks must have a minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.50%, a minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.00%, a minimum total risk-based capital ratio of 10.00%, and a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5.00%. On December 31, 2016, the Bank's common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.8%, its Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.8%, its total capital ratio was 12.7% and its Tier 1 leverage ratio was 10.8%. As a result, as of December 31, 2016, the Bank was well capitalized, with capital ratios in excess of those required to qualify as such. On December 31, 2015, the Bank's common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.0%, its Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.0%, its total capital ratio was 12.1% and its Tier 1 leverage ratio was 9.8%. As a result, as of December 31, 2015, the Bank was well capitalized, with capital ratios in excess of those required to qualify as such.\nThe FRB has established capital regulations for bank holding companies that generally parallel the capital regulations for banks. On December 31, 2016, the Company's common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 10.2%, its Tier 1 capital ratio was 10.8%, its total capital ratio was 13.6% and its Tier 1 leverage ratio was 9.9%. To be considered well capitalized, a bank holding company must have a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.00% and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.00%. As of December 31, 2016, the Company was considered well capitalized, with capital ratios in excess of those required to qualify as such. On December 31, 2015, the Company's common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 10.8%, its Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.5%, its total capital ratio was 12.6% and its Tier 1 leverage ratio was 10.2%. To be considered well capitalized, a bank holding company must have a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.00% and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.00%. As of December 31, 2015, the Company was considered well capitalized, with capital ratios in excess of those required to qualify as such.\nIn addition to the minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and total risk-based capital ratio, the Company and the Bank will have to maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional common equity Tier 1 capital greater than 2.5% of risk-weighted assets above the required minimum levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, repurchasing shares, and paying discretionary bonuses. The new capital conservation buffer requirement began phasing in beginning on January 1, 2016 when a buffer greater than 0.625% of risk-weighted assets was required, which amount will increase an equal amount each year until the buffer requirement of greater than 2.5% of risk-weighted assets is fully implemented on January 1, 2019.\nOn August 18, 2011, the Company entered into a Small Business Lending Fund-Securities Purchase Agreement (\"Purchase Agreement\") with the Secretary of the Treasury, pursuant to which the Company sold 57,943 shares of the Company's Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A (the \"SBLF Preferred Stock\") to the Secretary of the Treasury for a purchase price of $57.9 million. The SBLF Preferred Stock was issued pursuant to Treasury's SBLF program, a $30 billion fund established under the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 that was created to encourage lending to small businesses by providing Tier 1 capital to qualified community banks and holding companies with assets of less than $10 billion. As required by the SBLF Purchase Agreement, the proceeds from the sale of the SBLF Preferred Stock were used in connection with the redemption of all 58,000 shares of the Company's preferred stock, issued to Treasury in December 2008 pursuant to Treasury's TARP Capital Purchase Program (the \"CPP\"). The shares of CPP Preferred Stock were redeemed at their liquidation amount of $1,000 per share plus the accrued but unpaid dividends to the redemption date.\nThe SBLF Preferred Stock qualified as Tier 1 capital. The holders of SBLF Preferred Stock were entitled to receive noncumulative dividends, payable quarterly, on each January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1. The dividend rate, as a percentage of the liquidation\namount, could fluctuate between one percent (1%) and five percent (5%) per annum on a quarterly basis during the first 10 quarters during which the SBLF Preferred Stock was outstanding, based upon changes in the level of \"Qualified Small Business Lending\" or \"QSBL\" (as defined in the SBLF Purchase Agreement) by the Bank over the adjusted baseline level calculated under the terms of the SBLF Preferred Stock $(249.7 million). Based upon the increase in the Bank's level of QSBL over the adjusted baseline level, the dividend rate had been 1.0%. For the tenth calendar quarter through four and one-half years after issuance, the dividend rate was fixed at one percent (1%) based upon the level of qualifying loans. After four and one half years from issuance, the dividend rate would have increased to 9% (including a quarterly lending incentive fee of 0.5%).\nOn December 15, 2015, the Company (with the approval of its federal banking regulator) redeemed all 57,943 shares of the SBLF Preferred Stock at their liquidation amount of $1,000 per share plus accrued but unpaid dividends to the redemption date. The redemption of the SBLF Preferred Stock was completed using internally available funds.\nDividends. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company declared common stock cash dividends of $0.88 per share (27.4% of net income per common share) and paid common stock cash dividends of $0.88 per share. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company declared common stock cash dividends of $0.86 per share (26.2% of net income per common share) and paid common stock cash dividends of $0.84 per share. The Board of Directors meets regularly to consider the level and the timing of dividend payments. The $0.22 per share dividend declared but unpaid as of December 31, 2016, was paid to stockholders on January 13, 2017. In addition, the Company paid preferred dividends as described below in years prior to 2016.\nWhile the SBLF Preferred Stock was outstanding, the terms of the SBLF Preferred Stock limited the ability of the Company to pay dividends and repurchase shares of common stock. Under the terms of the SBLF Preferred Stock, no repurchases could be effected, and no dividends could be declared or paid on preferred shares ranking pari passu with the SBLF Preferred Stock, junior preferred shares, or other junior securities (including the common stock) during the current quarter and for the next three quarters following the failure to declare and pay dividends on the SBLF Preferred Stock, except that, in any such quarter in which the dividend is paid, dividend payments on shares ranking pari passu may be paid to the extent necessary to avoid any resulting material covenant breach.\nUnder the terms of the SBLF Preferred Stock, the Company could only declare and pay a dividend on the common stock or other stock junior to the SBLF Preferred Stock, or repurchase shares of any such class or series of stock, if, after payment of such dividend, or after giving effect to such repurchase, (i) the dollar amount of the Company's Tier 1 Capital would be at least equal to the \"Tier 1 Dividend Threshold\" and (ii) full dividends on all outstanding shares of SBLF Preferred Stock for the most recently completed dividend period have been or are contemporaneously declared and paid. We satisfied this condition through the redemption date of the SBLF Preferred Stock.\nCommon Stock Repurchases and Issuances. The Company has been in various buy-back programs since May 1990. Our ability to repurchase common stock was limited, but allowed, under the terms of the SBLF preferred stock as noted above, under \"-Dividends\" and was previously generally precluded due to our participation in the CPP from December 2008 through August 2011. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company issued 80,454 shares of stock at an average price of $26.47 per share and 133,126 shares of stock at an average price of $25.26 per share, respectively, to cover stock option exercises.\nManagement has historically utilized stock buy-back programs from time to time as long as management believed that repurchasing the stock would contribute to the overall growth of shareholder value. The number of shares of stock that will be repurchased at any particular time and the prices that will be paid are subject to many factors, several of which are outside of the control of the Company. The primary factors, however, are the number of shares available in the market from sellers at any given time, the price of the stock within the market as determined by the market and the projected impact on the Company's earnings per share and capital.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION\nForward-looking Statements\nWhen used in this Annual Report and in other documents filed or furnished by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), in the Company's press releases or other public or stockholder communications, and in oral statements made with the approval of an authorized executive officer, the words or phrases \"will likely result,\" \"are expected to,\" \"will continue,\" \"is anticipated,\" \"estimate,\" \"project,\" \"intends\" or similar expressions are intended to identify \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including, among other things, (i) non-interest expense reductions from Great Southern's banking center consolidations might be less than anticipated and the costs of the consolidation and impairment of the value of the affected premises might be greater than expected; (ii) expected revenues, cost savings, earnings accretion, synergies and other benefits from the Fifth Third Bank branch acquisition and the Company's other merger and acquisition activities might not be realized within the anticipated time frames or at all, and costs or difficulties relating to integration matters, including but not limited to customer and employee retention, might be greater than expected; (iii) changes in economic conditions, either nationally or in the Company's market areas; (iv) fluctuations in interest rates; (v) the risks of lending and investing activities, including changes in the level and direction of loan delinquencies and write-offs and changes in estimates of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses; (vi) the possibility of other-than-temporary impairments of securities held in the Company's securities portfolio; (vii) the Company's ability to access cost-effective funding; (viii) fluctuations in real estate values and both residential and commercial real estate market conditions; (ix) demand for loans and deposits in the Company's market areas; (x) the ability to adapt successfully to technological changes to meet customers' needs and developments in the marketplace; (xi) the possibility that security measures implemented might not be sufficient to mitigate the risk of a cyber attack or cyber theft, and that such security measures might not protect against systems failures or interruptions; (xii) legislative or regulatory changes that adversely affect the Company's business, including, without limitation, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and its implementing regulations, and the overdraft protection regulations and customers' responses thereto; (xiii) changes in accounting principles, policies or guidelines; (xiv) monetary and fiscal policies of the Federal Reserve Board and the U.S. Government and other governmental initiatives affecting the financial services industry; (xv) results of examinations of the Company and the Bank by their regulators, including the possibility that the regulators may, among other things, require the Company to increase its allowance for loan losses or to write-down assets; (xvi) costs and effects of litigation, including settlements and judgments; and (xvii) competition. The Company wishes to advise readers that the factors listed above and other risks described from time to time in documents filed or furnished by the Company with the SEC could affect the Company's financial performance and could cause the Company's actual results for future periods to differ materially from any opinions or statements expressed with respect to future periods in any current statements.\nThe Company does not undertake-and specifically declines any obligation- to publicly release the result of any revisions which may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.\nCritical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates\nThe accounting and reporting policies of the Company conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and general practices within the financial services industry. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nAllowance for Loan Losses and Valuation of Foreclosed Assets\nThe Company believes that the determination of the allowance for loan losses involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity than its other significant accounting policies. The allowance for loan losses is calculated with the objective of maintaining an allowance level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated loan losses. Management's determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio and other relevant factors. However, this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates of, among other things, expected default probabilities, loss once loans default, expected commitment usage, the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, value of collateral, estimated losses, and general amounts for historical loss experience.\nThe process also considers economic conditions, uncertainties in estimating losses and inherent risks in the loan portfolio. All of these factors may be susceptible to significant change. To the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates, additional provisions for loan losses may be required which would adversely impact earnings in future periods. In addition, the Bank's regulators could require additional provisions for loan losses as part of their examination process.\nAdditional discussion of the allowance for loan losses is included in \"Item 1. Business - Allowances for Losses on Loans and Foreclosed Assets.\" Inherent in this process is the evaluation of individual significant credit relationships. From time to time certain credit relationships may deteriorate due to payment performance, cash flow of the borrower, value of collateral, or other factors. In these instances, management may revise its loss estimates and assumptions for these specific credits due to changing circumstances. In some cases, additional losses may be realized; in other instances, the factors that led to the deterioration may improve or the credit may be refinanced elsewhere and allocated allowances may be released from the particular credit. In the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company began using a three-year average of historical losses for the general component of the allowance for loan loss calculation. The Company had previously used a five-year average. The Company believes that the three-year average provides a better representation of the current risks in the loan portfolio. This change was made after consultation with our regulators and third-party consultants, as well as a review of the practices used by the Company's peers. No other significant changes were made to management's overall methodology for evaluating the allowance for loan losses during the periods presented in the financial statements of this report.\nIn addition, the Company considers that the determination of the valuations of foreclosed assets held for sale involves a high degree of judgment and complexity. The carrying value of foreclosed assets reflects management's best estimate of the amount to be realized from the sales of the assets. While the estimate is generally based on a valuation by an independent appraiser or recent sales of similar properties, the amount that the Company realizes from the sales of the assets could differ materially from the carrying value reflected in the financial statements, resulting in losses that could adversely impact earnings in future periods.\nCarrying Value of Loans Acquired in FDIC-assisted Transactions and Indemnification Asset\nThe Company considers that the determination of the carrying value of loans acquired in the FDIC-assisted transactions and the carrying value of the related FDIC indemnification asset involves a high degree of judgment and complexity. The carrying value of the acquired loans and the FDIC indemnification asset reflect management's best ongoing estimates of the amounts to be realized on each of these assets. The Company determined initial fair value accounting estimates of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities in accordance with FASB ASC 805, Business Combinations. However, the amount that the Company realizes on these assets could differ materially from the carrying value reflected in its financial statements, based upon the timing of collections on the acquired loans in future periods. Because of the loss sharing agreements with the FDIC on certain of these assets, the Company should not incur any significant losses related to these assets. To the extent the actual values realized for the acquired loans are different from the estimates, the indemnification asset will generally be impacted in an offsetting manner due to the loss sharing support from the FDIC. Subsequent to the initial valuation, the Company continues to monitor identified loan pools and related loss sharing assets for changes in estimated cash flows projected for the loan pools, anticipated credit losses and changes in the accretable yield. Analysis of these variables requires significant estimates and a high degree of judgment. See Note 4 of the accompanying audited financial statements for additional information regarding the TeamBank, Vantus Bank, Sun Security Bank, InterBank and Valley Bank FDIC-assisted transactions.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are subject to an impairment test at least annually and more frequently if circumstances indicate their value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment using a process that estimates the fair value of each of the Company's reporting units compared with its carrying value. The Company defines reporting units as a level below each of its operating segments for which there is discrete financial information that is regularly reviewed. As of December 31, 2016, the Company has one reporting unit to which goodwill has been allocated - the Bank. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, then no impairment is recorded. If the carrying value amount exceeds the fair value of a reporting unit,\nfurther testing is completed comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill to its carrying value to measure the amount of impairment. Intangible assets that are not amortized will be tested for impairment at least annually by comparing the fair values of those assets to their carrying values. At December 31, 2016, goodwill consisted of $5.4 million at the Bank reporting unit, which included goodwill of $4.2 million that was recorded during 2016 related to the acquisition of 12 branches from Fifth Third Bank. Other identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization are amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of seven years. At December 31, 2016, the amortizable intangible assets consisted of core deposit intangibles of $7.1 million, including $3.8 million related to the Fifth Third Bank transaction in January 2016, $1.8 million related to the Valley Bank transaction in June 2014 and $519,000 related to the Boulevard Bank transaction in March 2014. These amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment if circumstances indicate their value may not be recoverable based on a comparison of fair value. See Note 1 of the accompanying audited financial statements for additional information.\nFor purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, the Company used a market approach to value its reporting unit. The market approach applies a market multiple, based on observed purchase transactions for each reporting unit, to the metrics appropriate for the valuation of the operating unit. Significant judgment is applied when goodwill is assessed for impairment. This judgment may include developing cash flow projections, selecting appropriate discount rates, identifying relevant market comparables and incorporating general economic and market conditions.\nBased on the Company's goodwill impairment testing, management does not believe any of its goodwill or other intangible assets are impaired as of December 31, 2016. While the Company believes no impairment existed at December 31, 2016, different conditions or assumptions used to measure fair value of the reporting unit, or changes in cash flows or profitability, if significantly negative or unfavorable, could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of the Company's impairment evaluation in the future.\nCurrent Economic Conditions\nChanges in economic conditions could cause the values of assets and liabilities recorded in the financial statements to change rapidly, resulting in material future adjustments in asset values, the allowance for loan losses, or capital that could negatively impact the Company's ability to meet regulatory capital requirements and maintain sufficient liquidity.\nFollowing the bursting of the housing bubble in mid-2007 and the subsequent housing market correction and subprime mortgage crisis, the United States entered into a significant prolonged economic downturn. Unemployment rose from 4.7% in November 2007 to peak at 10.0% in October 2009. The elevated unemployment levels negatively impacted consumer confidence, which had a detrimental impact on industry-wide performance nationally as well as in the Company's Midwest market area. Economic conditions have improved considerably over the past few years as indicated by increasing consumer confidence levels, increased economic activity and low unemployment levels.\nThe national unemployment rate decreased from 5.0% as of December 2015 to 4.7% as of December 2016. The labor force participation rate, which is the share of working-age Americans who are either employed or are actively looking for a job, remained level at 63%. The economy added 156,000 jobs in December 2016, with employment gains predominantly occurring in health care and social assistance. Job growth totaled 2.2 million in 2016, which was less than the 2.7 million increase in 2015. As of December 31, 2016, the unemployment rate for the Midwest, where most of the Company's business is conducted, was at 4.1% significantly lower than the 4.6% U.S. rate. Unemployment rates at December 31, 2016, were: Missouri at 4.4%, Arkansas at 3.9%, Kansas at 4.2%, Iowa at 3.6%, Nebraska at 3.4%, Minnesota at 3.9%, Oklahoma at 5.0% and Texas at 4.6%. A few state unemployment rates increased compared to December 2015 levels; however, Oklahoma was the only state with an unemployment rate greater than the national average. Oklahoma was affected by job losses in the manufacturing, mining and logging industries. Of the metropolitan areas in which Great Southern Bank does business, the Tulsa market area had the highest unemployment level at December 31, 2016 at 5.0%. The unemployment rate at 3.9 % for the Springfield market area was below the national average reported as of December 31, 2016. Metropolitan areas in Arkansas, Iowa, Nebraska and Minnesota boasted unemployment levels among the lowest in the nation.\nSales of newly built, single-family homes were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 536,000 units in December 2016, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the U.S. Census Bureau. This represents a 10.4% decrease since November 2016 and a 0.4% drop from the December 2015 rate of 538,000. The median sales price of new houses sold in December 2016 was $322,500, with an average sales price of $384,000. The seasonally adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of December 2016 was 259,000, which represented a supply of 5.8 months at the current sales rate. Sales of existing single-family homes closed out 2016 as the best year in a decade, even as sales declined in December as the result of ongoing affordability tensions and historically low supply levels. In December, existing sales decreased 2.8% resulting in sales only 0.7% higher than a year ago. First-time buyers made up 32% of those transactions, the biggest share in four years, easing concerns that a shortage of affordable houses has been pushing entry-level buyers out of the market. The median existing-home price for all housing types in December was $232,200, up 4% from December 2015 ($223,200). Total housing inventory at the end of December dropped 10.8% to 1.65 million existing homes available for sale, which is the lowest level since National Association of Realtors began tracking the supply of all housing types in 1999. Unsold inventory is at a 3.6 month supply at the current sales pace.\nDistressed sales, which include foreclosures and short sales, rose to 7% in December, down from 8% a year ago. Foreclosures sold for an average discount of 20% below market value, while short sales were discounted 10%.\nThe performance of commercial real estate markets has improved throughout the Company's market areas as shown by increased real estate sales and financing activity. According to real estate services firm CoStar Group, retail, office and industrial types of commercial real estate properties continue to improve or remain stable in occupancy, absorption and rental income, both nationally and in our market areas.\nWhile current economic indicators show improvement nationally in employment, housing starts and prices, commercial real estate occupancy, absorption and rental income, our management will continue to closely monitor regional, national and global economic conditions, as these could significantly impact our market areas.\nLoss Sharing Agreements\nOn April 26, 2016, Great Southern Bank executed an agreement with the FDIC to terminate the loss sharing agreements for Team Bank, Vantus Bank and Sun Security Bank, effective immediately. The agreement required the FDIC to pay $4.4 million to settle all outstanding items related to the terminated loss sharing agreements. As a result of entering into the agreement, assets that were covered by the terminated loss sharing agreements, including covered loans in the amount of $61.5 million and covered other real estate owned in the amount of $468,000 as of March 31, 2016, were reclassified as non-covered assets effective April 26, 2016. In anticipation of terminating the loss sharing agreements, an impairment of the related indemnification assets was recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2016 in the amount of $584,000. On the date of the termination, the indemnification asset balances (and certain other receivables from the FDIC) related to Team Bank, Vantus Bank and Sun Security Bank, which totaled $4.4 million at March 31, 2016, became $0 as a result of the receipt of funds from the FDIC as outlined in the termination agreement. There will be no future effects on non-interest income (expense) related to adjustments or amortization of the indemnification assets for Team Bank, Vantus Bank or Sun Security Bank; however, adjustments and amortization related to the InterBank indemnification asset and loss sharing agreement will continue. The remaining accretable yield adjustments that affect interest income are not changed by this transaction and continue to be recognized for all FDIC-assisted transactions in the same manner as they have been previously.\nThe termination of the loss sharing agreements for the TeamBank, Vantus Bank and Sun Security Bank transactions has had no impact on the yields for the loans that were previously covered under these agreements. All future recoveries, gains, losses and expenses related to these previously covered assets will now be recognized entirely by Great Southern Bank since the FDIC will no longer be sharing in such gains or losses. Accordingly, the Company's future earnings will be positively impacted to the extent the Company recognizes gains on any sales or recoveries in excess of the carrying value of such assets. Similarly, the Company's future earnings will be negatively impacted to the extent the Company recognizes expenses, losses or charge-offs related to such assets.\nGeneral\nThe profitability of the Company and, more specifically, the profitability of its primary subsidiary, the Bank, depends primarily on its net interest income, as well as provisions for loan losses and the level of non-interest income and non-interest expense. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income the Bank earns on its loans and investment portfolio, and the interest it pays on interest-bearing liabilities, which consists mainly of interest paid on deposits and borrowings. Net interest income is affected by the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on these balances. When interest-earning assets approximate or exceed interest-bearing liabilities, any positive interest rate spread will generate net interest income.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2016, Great Southern's total assets increased $446.5 million, or 10.9%, from $4.10 billion at December 31, 2015, to $4.55 billion at December 31, 2016. Full details of the current year changes in total assets are provided in the \"Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015\" section.\nLoans. In the year ended December 31, 2016, Great Southern's net loans increased $419.4 million, or 12.6%, from $3.34 billion at December 31, 2015, to $3.76 billion at December 31, 2016. Partially offsetting the increase in loans was a decrease of $79.7 million in the FDIC-acquired loan portfolios. Excluding previously acquired covered and non-covered loans and mortgage loans held for sale, but including the loans acquired from Fifth Third Bank, total loans increased $499.7 million from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016. The increases occurred across several loans types, primarily in other residential (multi-family) loans, commercial real estate loans, one- to four-family residential loans, consumer loans and home equity lines of credit. The increase was primarily due to loan growth in our existing banking center network, and also due to the loans acquired from Fifth Third Bank during the year. As loan demand is affected by a variety of factors, including general economic conditions, and because of the competition we face and our focus on pricing discipline and credit quality, we cannot be assured that our loan growth will match or exceed the level of increases achieved in 2016 or prior years. The Company's strategy continues to be focused on maintaining credit risk and interest rate risk at appropriate levels.\nLoan growth has occurred in most loan types and has come from most of Great Southern's primary lending locations, including Springfield, St. Louis, Kansas City, Des Moines, and Minneapolis, as well as the loan production offices in Dallas and Tulsa. Net loan balances have increased primarily in the areas of commercial construction, consumer, and commercial real estate (including multi-family). Generally, the Company considers these types of loans to involve a higher degree of risk compared to some other types of loans, such as first mortgage loans on one- to four-family, owner-occupied residential properties, and has established certain minimum underwriting standards to help assure portfolio quality. For commercial real estate and construction loans, these standards and procedures include, but are not limited to, an analysis of the borrower's financial condition, collateral, repayment ability, verification of liquid assets and credit history as required by loan type. In addition, geographic diversity of collateral, lower loan-to-value ratios and limitations on speculative construction projects help to mitigate overall risk in these loans. It has been, and continues to be, Great Southern's practice to verify information from potential borrowers regarding assets, income or payment ability and credit ratings as applicable and as required by the authority approving the loan. Underwriting standards also include loan-to-value ratios which vary depending on collateral type, debt service coverage ratios or debt payment to income ratios, where applicable, credit histories, use of guaranties and other recommended terms relating to equity requirements, amortization, and maturity. Great Southern's loan committee reviews and approves all new loan originations in excess of lender approval authorities. Consumer loans are primarily secured by new and used motor vehicles and these loans are also subject to certain minimum underwriting standards to assure portfolio quality. Great Southern's consumer underwriting and pricing standards have been fairly consistent over the past several years. The underwriting standards employed by Great Southern for consumer loans include a determination of the applicant's payment history on other debts, credit scores, employment history and an assessment of ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. Although creditworthiness of the applicant is of primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral, if any, in relation to the proposed loan amount.\nOf the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2016 and 2015, 75.9% and 73.5%, respectively, was secured by real estate, as this is the Bank's primary focus in its lending efforts. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, commercial real estate and commercial construction loans were 42.1% and 42.8% of the Bank's total loan portfolio (excluding loans acquired through FDIC-assisted transactions), respectively. Commercial real estate and commercial construction loans generally afford the Bank an opportunity to increase the yield on, and the proportion of interest rate sensitive loans in, its portfolio. They do, however, present somewhat greater risk to the Bank because they may be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the economy generally. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, loans made in the Springfield, Mo. metropolitan statistical area (Springfield MSA) were 12% and 15% of the Bank's total loan portfolio (excluding loans acquired through FDIC-assisted transactions), respectively. The Company's headquarters are located in Springfield and we have operated in this market since 1923. Because of our large presence and experience in the Springfield MSA, many lending opportunities exist. However, if the economic conditions of the Springfield MSA were worse than those of other market areas in which we operate or the national economy overall, the performance of these loans could decline comparatively. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, loans made in the St. Louis, Mo. metropolitan statistical area (St. Louis MSA) were 19% and 18% of the Bank's total loan portfolio (excluding loans acquired through FDIC-assisted transactions, but including loans acquired from Fifth Third Bank), respectively. The Company's expansion into the St. Louis MSA beginning in May 2009 has provided an opportunity to not only expand its markets and provide diversification from the Springfield MSA, but also has provided access to a larger economy with increased lending opportunities despite higher levels of competition. Loans made in the St. Louis MSA are primarily commercial real estate, commercial business and multi-family residential loans which are less likely to be impacted by the higher levels of unemployment rates, as mentioned above under \"Current Economic Conditions,\" than if the focus were on one- to four-family residential and consumer loans. For further discussions of the Bank's loan portfolio, and specifically, commercial real estate and commercial construction loans, see \"Item 1. Business - Lending Activities.\"\nThe percentage of fixed-rate loans in our loan portfolio has increased from 46% as of December 31, 2010 to 57% as of December 31, 2016 due to customer preference for fixed rate loans during this period of low interest rates. The majority of the increase in fixed rate loans was in commercial construction and consumer loans, both of which typically have loans with short durations. Of the total amount of fixed rate loans in our portfolio as of December 31, 2016, approximately 77% mature within one to five years and therefore are not considered to create significant long-term interest rate risk for the Company. Fixed rate loans make up only a portion of our balance sheet and our overall interest rate risk strategy. As of December 31, 2016, our interest rate risk models indicated a one-year interest rate earnings sensitivity position that is fairly neutral. For further discussion of our interest rate sensitivity gap and the processes used to manage our exposure to interest rate risk, see \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - How We Measure the Risks to Us Associated with Interest Rate Changes.\" For discussion of the risk factors associated with interest rate changes, see \"Risk Factors - We may be adversely affected by interest rate changes.\"\nWhile our policy allows us to lend up to 95% of the appraised value on one-to four-family residential properties, originations of loans with loan-to-value ratios at that level are minimal. Private mortgage insurance is typically required for loan amounts above the 80% level. Few exceptions occur and would be based on analyses which determined minimal transactional risk to be involved. We consider these lending practices to be consistent with or more conservative than what we believe to be the norm for banks our size. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, an estimated 0.2% and 0.2%, respectively, of total owner occupied one- to four-family\nresidential loans had loan-to-value ratios above 100% at origination. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, an estimated 1.3% and 2.1%, respectively, of total non-owner occupied one- to four-family residential loans had loan-to-value ratios above 100% at origination.\nAt December 31, 2016, troubled debt restructurings totaled $21.1 million, or 0.6% of total loans, down $23.9 million from $45.0 million, or 1.3% of total loans, at December 31, 2015. Concessions granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties may include a reduction in the interest rate on the loan, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance or other actions intended to maximize collection. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, no loans were restructured into multiple new loans. For further information on troubled debt restructurings, see Note 3 of the accompanying audited financial statements, which are included in Item 8 of this report.\nThe loss sharing agreement for InterBank with the FDIC is subject to limitations on the types of losses covered and the length of time losses are covered, and is conditioned upon the Bank complying with its requirements in the agreement with the FDIC, including requirements regarding servicing and other loan administration matters. The original terms of the loss sharing agreement extends for ten years for single family real estate loans and for five years for other loans. As noted above, the loss sharing agreements for Team Bank, Vantus Bank and Sun Security Bank were terminated on April 26, 2016.\nAt December 31, 2016, approximately five and one half years remained on the loss sharing agreement for single family real estate loans acquired from InterBank and the remaining loans had an estimated average life of four to twelve years. At December 31, 2016, approximately six months remained on the loss sharing agreement for non-single-family loans acquired from InterBank and the remaining loans had an estimated average life of one to two years. While the expected repayments for certain of the acquired loans extend beyond the terms of the loss sharing agreement, the Bank has identified and will continue to identify problem loans and will make every effort to resolve them within the time limits of the agreement. The Company may sell any loans remaining at the end of the loss sharing agreement subject to the approval of the FDIC.\nLoans that were acquired through FDIC-assisted transactions, which are accounted for in pools, are currently included in the analysis and estimation of the allowance for loan losses. If expected cash flows to be received on any given pool of loans decreases from previous estimates, then a determination is made as to whether the loan pool should be charged down or the allowance for loan losses should be increased (through a provision for loan losses). This is true of all acquired loan pools regardless of whether or not they are covered by a loss sharing agreement. If a charge down occurs to a loan pool that is covered by the loss sharing agreement, the full amount of the charge down will be reflected in the allowance for loan losses and a separate asset will be recorded for the amount to be recovered from the FDIC. The loss sharing agreements (both current and terminated) and their related limitations are described in detail in Note 4 of the accompanying audited financial statements, included in Item 8 of this Report. For acquired loan pools that currently are not covered by loss sharing agreements, the Company may allocate, and at December 31, 2016, has allocated, a portion of its allowance for loan losses related to these loan pools in a manner similar to how it allocates its allowance for loan losses to those loans which are collectively evaluated for impairment.\nThe level of non-performing loans and foreclosed assets affects our net interest income and net income. We generally do not accrue interest income on these loans and do not recognize interest income until the loans are repaid or interest payments have been made for a period of time sufficient to provide evidence of performance on the loans. Generally, the higher the level of non-performing assets, the greater the negative impact on interest income and net income.\nAvailable-for-sale Securities. In the year ended December 31, 2016, available-for-sale securities decreased $49.0 million, or 18.6%, from $262.9 million at December 31, 2015, to $213.9 million at December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to calls of municipal securities, sales of certain mortgage-backed securities, the sale of an investment in a managed equity fund held by the Company, and normal monthly payments received related to the portfolio of mortgage-backed securities, partially offset by the purchase of certain mortgage-backed securities. The Company was required to divest the investment it held in the managed equity fund as a result of regulations recently adopted by the Federal Reserve Board. Other investment securities were reduced because they were no longer needed for pledging for public fund deposits.\nPremises and Equipment, net. Great Southern had net premises and equipment of $140.6 million at December 31, 2016, an increase of $10.9 million, or 8.4%, from $129.7 million at December 31, 2015. The increase in premises and equipment was primarily due to the acquisition of 12 branches from Fifth Third Bank in January 2016. For further information on the acquisition, see the Company's March 31, 2016 Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The Company's goodwill and other intangible assets totaled $12.5 million at December 31, 2016, an increase of $6.7 million, or 117.1%, compared to $5.8 million at December 31, 2015. The increase was due to the goodwill and core deposit intangible amounts recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2016 related to the Fifth Third Bank branch acquisition, as discussed above in the \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets\" section of this report.\nDeposits. The Company attracts deposit accounts through its retail branch network, correspondent banking and corporate services areas, and brokered deposits. The Company then utilizes these deposit funds, along with FHLBank advances and other borrowings, to meet loan demand or otherwise fund its activities. In the year ended December 31, 2016, total deposit balances increased $408.6 million, or 12.5%. Transaction account balances increased $212.0 million, while retail certificates of deposit increased $156.1 million. These increases were primarily a result of the Bank's assumption of deposits as part of the Fifth Third Bank branch acquisition in January 2016, as well as growth at existing branches and new retail certificate of deposit product offerings. Great Southern Bank customer deposits totaling $14.0 million and $12.2 million, at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, were part of the CDARS program which allows bank customers to maintain balances in an insured manner that would otherwise exceed the FDIC deposit insurance limit. The FDIC counts these deposits as brokered, but these are deposit accounts that we generate with customers in our local markets. Brokered deposits, including CDARS program purchased funds, were $310.3 million at December 31, 2016, an increase of $38.8 million from $271.5 million at December 31, 2015.\nOur deposit balances may fluctuate depending on customer preferences and our relative need for funding. We do not consider our retail certificates of deposit to be guaranteed long-term funding because customers can withdraw their funds at any time with minimal interest penalty. When loan demand trends upward, we can increase rates paid on deposits to increase deposit balances and utilize brokered deposits to provide additional funding. The level of competition for deposits in our markets is high. It is our goal to gain deposit market share, particularly checking accounts, in our branch footprint. To accomplish this goal, increasing rates to attract deposits may be necessary, which could negatively impact the Company's net interest margin.\nOur ability to fund growth in future periods may also depend on our ability to continue to access brokered deposits and FHLBank advances. In times when our loan demand has outpaced our generation of new deposits, we have utilized brokered deposits and FHLBank advances to fund these loans. These funding sources have been attractive to us because we can create either fixed or variable rate funding, as desired, which more closely matches the interest rate nature of much of our loan portfolio. While we do not currently anticipate that our ability to access these sources will be reduced or eliminated in future periods, if this should happen, the limitation on our ability to fund additional loans could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nShort-term Borrowings and Federal Home Loan Bank Advances. Federal Home Loan Bank advances decreased $232.0 million from $263.5 million at December 31, 2015 to $31.5 million at December 31, 2016. The decreased advances were replaced with overnight fed funds borrowings through the FHLBank based on funding needs. As such, short-term borrowings increased by $171.0 million, from $1.3 million at December 31, 2015 to $172.3 million at December 31, 2016. The overnight fed funds borrowing rate was lower than the one week or longer term rates for FHLBank advances, so the Company elected to utilize the overnight borrowings.\nSubordinated Notes. In August 2016, the Company issued $75 million of 5.25% fixed-to-floating rate Subordinated Notes due August 15, 2026. The notes were sold at par, resulting in net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and commissions and other issuance costs, of approximately $73.5 million. The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes.\nNet Interest Income and Interest Rate Risk Management. Our net interest income may be affected positively or negatively by changes in market interest rates. A portion of our loan portfolio is tied to the \"prime rate\" and adjusts immediately when this rate adjusts (subject to the effect of loan interest rate floors, which are discussed below). We monitor our sensitivity to interest rate changes on an ongoing basis (see \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\"). In addition, our net interest income may be impacted by changes in the cash flows expected to be received from acquired loan pools. As described in Note 4 of the accompanying audited financial statements, which are included in Item 8 of this report, the Company's evaluation of cash flows expected to be received from acquired loan pools is on-going and increases in cash flow expectations are recognized as increases in accretable yield through interest income. Decreases in cash flow expectations are recognized as impairments through the allowance for loan losses.\nThe current level and shape of the interest rate yield curve poses challenges for interest rate risk management. Prior to its increases of 0.25% on December 16, 2015 and 0.25% on December 14, 2016, the FRB last changed interest rates on December 16, 2008. Great Southern has a substantial portion of its loan portfolio ($1.02 billion at December 31, 2016) which is tied to the one-month LIBOR index and will adjust at least once within 90 days after December 31, 2016. Of these loans, $471 million had interest rate floors.\nGreat Southern also has a significant portfolio of loans ($387 million at December 31, 2016) which are tied to a \"prime rate\" of interest and will adjust immediately with changes to the \"prime rate\" of interest. Most of these loans are tied to some national index of \"prime,\" while some are indexed to \"Great Southern Bank prime\" (GSB prime). The Company had elected to leave its GSB prime rate at 5.00%, but increased this rate to 5.25% in December 2015 following the FRB rate increase. The GSB prime rate was not changed following the FRB rate increase in December 2016. This does not affect a large number of customers, as there is no longer a significant portion of the loan portfolio indexed to the GSB prime rate. But for the interest rate floors, a rate cut by the FRB generally would have an anticipated immediate negative impact on the Company's net interest income due to the large total balance of loans which generally adjust immediately as the Federal Funds rate adjusts. Loans at their floor rates are, however, subject to the risk that\nborrowers will seek to refinance elsewhere at the lower market rate. Because the Federal Funds rate is already very low, there may also be a negative impact on the Company's net interest income due to the Company's inability to significantly lower its funding costs in the current competitive rate environment, although interest rates on assets may decline further. Conversely, interest rate increases would normally result in increased interest rates on our prime-based loans. The interest rate floors in effect may limit the immediate increase in interest rates on certain of these loans, until such time as rates rise above the floors. However, the Company may have to increase rates paid on deposits to maintain deposit balances and pay higher rates on borrowings. The impact of the low rate environment on our net interest margin in future periods is expected to be fairly neutral. Any margin gained by rate increases on loans may be somewhat offset by reduced yields from our investment securities and our existing loan portfolio as payments are made and the proceeds are potentially reinvested at lower rates. Interest rates on certain adjustable rate mortgage-backed securities and loans may reset lower according to their contractual terms and index rate to which they are tied and new loans may be originated at lower market rates than the overall portfolio rate. For further discussion of the processes used to manage our exposure to interest rate risk, see \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - How We Measure the Risks to Us Associated with Interest Rate Changes.\"\nThe negative impact of declining loan interest rates had been mitigated by the positive effects of the Company's loans which have interest rate floors. At December 31, 2016, the Company had a portfolio (excluding the loans acquired in the FDIC-assisted transactions) of prime-based loans totaling approximately $387 million with rates that change immediately with changes to the prime rate of interest. Of those loans, $382 million also had interest rate floors. These floors were at varying rates, with $8 million of these loans having floor rates of 7.0% or greater and another $76 million of these loans having floor rates between 5.0% and 7.0%. In addition, $298 million of these loans have floor rates between 2.75% and 5.0%. At December 31, 2016, $93 million of these loans were at their floor rates. Also included in these prime-based loans at December 31, 2016, the Company had a portfolio (excluding the loans acquired in the FDIC-assisted transactions) of GSB prime-based loans totaling approximately $60 million with rates that change immediately with changes to the GSB prime rate of interest. Of those loans, $58 million also had interest rate floors. At December 31, 2016, $16 million of the $58 million GSB prime rate loans with interest rate floors were at their floor rates. The loan yield for the total loan portfolio was approximately 83 basis points, 106 basis points and 141 basis points higher than the national \"prime rate of interest\" at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, partly because of these interest rate floors. While interest rate floors have had an overall positive effect on the Company's results during this period, they do subject the Company to the risk that borrowers will elect to refinance their loans with other lenders. To the extent economic conditions improve, the risk that borrowers will seek to refinance their loans increases.\nNon-Interest Income and Operating Expenses. The Company's profitability is also affected by the level of its non-interest income and operating expenses. Non-interest income consists primarily of service charges and ATM fees, accretion income (net of amortization) related to the FDIC-assisted acquisitions, late charges and prepayment fees on loans, gains on sales of loans and available-for-sale investments and other general operating income. In 2014, 2012, 2011 and 2009, non-interest income was also affected by the gains recognized on the FDIC-assisted transactions. In early 2016 and all of 2015 and 2014, increases in the cash flows expected to be collected from the FDIC-covered loan portfolios resulted in amortization (expense) recorded relating to reductions of expected reimbursements under the loss sharing agreements with the FDIC, which are recorded as indemnification assets. This is no longer the case for the TeamBank, Vantus Bank and Sun Security Bank transactions, subsequent to April 26, 2016 (due to the termination of the related loss sharing agreements effective as of that date). It is still the case for InterBank loans. Non-interest income may also be affected by the Company's interest rate derivative activities, if the Company chooses to implement derivatives.\nOperating expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits, occupancy-related expenses, expenses related to foreclosed assets, postage, FDIC deposit insurance, advertising and public relations, telephone, professional fees, office expenses and other general operating expenses. Details of the current period changes in non-interest income and non-interest expense are provided under \"Results of Operations and Comparison for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\"\nBusiness Initiatives\nThe Company completed several initiatives to expand and enhance the franchise in 2016.\nDuring 2016, the Company decreased its banking center network from 110 to 104 full-service retail offices. The Company regularly evaluates its banking center network and lines of business to ensure that it is serving customers in the best way possible. The banking center network constantly evolves with changes in customer needs and preferences, emerging technology and local market developments. In response to these changes, the Company opens banking centers and invests resources where customer demand leads, and from time to time, consolidates banking centers when market conditions dictate.\nOn January 29, 2016, Great Southern completed the acquisition of 12 branches and related deposits and loans from Cincinnati-based Fifth Third Bank in the St. Louis market area. This acquisition increased Great Southern's St. Louis-area banking center total from eight to ultimately 19 offices and doubled its customer deposit base in this market. The deposits assumed totaled approximately $228 million and the loans acquired totaled approximately $159 million.\nThroughout 2016, the Company consolidated operations of 16 banking centers into other nearby Great Southern offices. Each consolidated office was evaluated on a number of criteria, including access and availability of services to affected customers, the proximity of other Great Southern banking centers, profitability and transaction volumes and market dynamics. Of these 16 consolidated banking centers, eleven were in Missouri, four in Iowa and one was in Kansas. Nine of these banking centers were acquired as part of various FDIC-assisted acquisitions. In addition, the Company also sold two Missouri banking centers, with associated deposits, to separate buyers in early 2016. The Great Southern banking center located in Thayer, Mo., was sold on February 19, 2016, and the office in Buffalo, Mo., was sold on March 18, 2016.\nIn addition, in January 2017, two leased banking centers were replaced by two new owned offices in the Omaha, Neb., metropolitan market area. Both new locations offer better convenience and access to area customers. Great Southern operates four offices in the Omaha market area.\nThe Company executed an agreement with the FDIC to terminate loss sharing agreements related to the FDIC-assisted acquisitions of TeamBank, Vantus Bank and Sun Security Bank in April 2016. The agreement required the FDIC to pay $4.4 million to settle all outstanding items related to the terminated loss sharing agreements. As a result of entering into the agreement, assets that were covered by the terminated loss sharing agreements, including covered loans in the amount of $61.5 million and covered other real estate owned in the amount of $468,000 as of March 31, 2016, were reclassified as non-covered assets effective April 26, 2016. More information about this agreement can be found in the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016.\nIn July 2016, the Company filed a universal shelf registration statement (Form S-3) with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This registration allows the Company to expeditiously offer investors up to a total of $250 million in common stock, preferred stock, trust preferred securities or debt obligations. With the Board's prior approval, public offerings can be made at various times and for various amounts depending on the needs of the Company.\nIn August 2016, utilizing the shelf registration statement, the Company completed the public offering and sale of $75 million of its 5.25% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due August 15, 2026. The Notes were sold at par, resulting in net proceeds, after underwriting discounts, commissions and expenses, of approximately $73.5 million. The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes.\nIn October 2016, the Company began mass issuing chip-enabled debit cards in phases to its deposit customer base. The mass issuance was completed in February 2017. Chip debit cards offer customers an added layer of security, providing enhanced protection against fraud. Chip debit cards are also available instantly at all Great Southern banking centers.\nThe Company expects to open a commercial loan production office in downtown Chicago in the first quarter of 2017. A local and highly experienced commercial lender has been hired to manage that office. The Company also operates commercial loan production offices in Tulsa, Okla., and Dallas.\nA person-to-person (P2P) electronic payment service was introduced in early February 2017. Available for retail customers through the Company's smartphone mobile banking applications, the P2P service allows Great Southern debit card customers to send one-time transfers to recipients at any financial institution.\nThe Company's chief lending officer, Steve Mitchem, previously announced his plans to retire from the Company in April 2017. Mr. Mitchem joined Great Southern in 1990. During his tenure, the Company's loan portfolio grew from $360 million, with lending operations primarily in the southwest Missouri region, to $3.8 billion with lending operations in eight states. Mr. Mitchem and the Company began planning for his pending retirement more than a year ago to ensure a smooth management transition. At that time, the Company restructured the lending division to better reflect the Company's size and scope. The lending division now has two separate areas of responsibility - loan production led by John Bugh and credit administration led by Kevin Baker. Mr. Bugh and Mr. Baker are long-term Great Southern lenders, who each have more than 27 years of banking experience.\nEffect of Federal Laws and Regulations\nGeneral. Federal legislation and regulation significantly affect the operations of the Company and the Bank, and have increased competition among commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking enterprises and other financial institutions. In particular, the capital requirements and operations of regulated banking organizations such as the Company and the Bank have been and will be subject to changes in applicable statutes and regulations from time to time, which changes could, under certain circumstances, adversely affect the Company or the Bank.\nSignificant Legislation Impacting the Financial Services Industry. On July 21, 2010, sweeping financial regulatory reform legislation entitled the \"Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act\" (the \"Dodd-Frank Act\") was signed into law. The Dodd-\nFrank Act implements far-reaching changes across the financial regulatory landscape, including provisions that, among other things, centralize responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating a new agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, with broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks, require new capital rules (discussed below), change the assessment base for federal deposit insurance, repeal the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits, amend the account balance limit for federal deposit insurance protection, and increase the authority of the Federal Reserve Board to examine the Company and its non-bank subsidiaries.\nMany aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to rulemaking and will take effect over a number of years, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on the Company and the financial services industry more generally. Provisions in the legislation that affect deposit insurance assessments and payment of interest on demand deposits could increase the costs associated with deposits. Provisions in the legislation that require revisions to the capital requirements of the Company and the Bank could require the Company and the Bank to seek additional sources of capital in the future.\nA provision of the Dodd-Frank Act, commonly referred to as the \"Durbin Amendment,\" directed the FRB to analyze the debit card payments system and fix the interchange rates based upon their estimate of actual costs. The FRB has established the interchange rate for all debit transactions for issuers with over $10 billion in assets at $0.21 per transaction. An additional five basis points of the transaction amount and an additional $0.01 may be collected by the issuer for fraud prevention and recovery, provided the issuer performs certain actions. The Bank is currently exempt from the rule on the basis of asset size.\nNew Capital Rules. The federal banking agencies have adopted new regulatory capital rules that substantially amend the risk-based capital rules applicable to the Bank and the Company. The new rules implement the \"Basel III\" regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. \"Basel III\" refers to various documents released by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. For the Company and the Bank, the general effective date of the new rules was January 1, 2015, and, for certain provisions, various phase-in periods and later effective dates apply. The chief features of the new rules are summarized below.\nThe new rules refine the definitions of what constitutes regulatory capital and add a new regulatory capital element, common equity Tier 1 capital. The minimum capital ratios are (i) a common equity Tier 1 (\"CET1\") risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6%; (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 8%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. In addition to the minimum capital ratios, the new rules include a capital conservation buffer, under which a banking organization must have CET1 more than 2.5% above each of its minimum risk-based capital ratios in order to avoid restrictions on paying dividends, repurchasing shares, and paying certain discretionary bonuses. The new capital conservation buffer requirement began phasing in beginning on January 1, 2016 when a buffer greater than 0.625% of risk-weighted assets was required, which amount will increase an equal amount each year until the buffer requirement of greater than 2.5% of risk-weighted assets is fully implemented on January 1, 2019.\nEffective January 1, 2015, the new rules also revised the prompt corrective action framework, which is designed to place restrictions on insured depository institutions if their capital levels show signs of weakness. Under the new prompt corrective action requirements, insured depository institutions are required to meet the following in order to qualify as \"well capitalized:\" (i) a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.5%, (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%, (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10% and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5%, and must not be subject to an order, agreement or directive mandating a specific capital level.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 to the accompanying audited financial statements, which are included in Item 8 of this Report, for a description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective dates of adoption and expected effects on the Company's financial position and results of operations.\nComparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, total assets increased by $446.5 million to $4.55 billion. The increase was primarily attributable to the loan, premises and equipment and intangible assets related to the Fifth Third Bank branch acquisition, as well as an increase in loans originated by the Bank and cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by reductions in available-for-sale investment securities and the FDIC indemnification asset.\nNet loans increased $419.4 million to $3.76 billion at December 31, 2016. Outstanding and undisbursed balances of other residential (multi-family) loans increased $243.8 million, or 58.1%, commercial construction loans increased $179.8 million, or 29.9%, commercial real estate loans increased $143.4 million, or 13.7%, owner occupied one- to four-family residential loans increased $90.1 million, or 81.7%, and consumer auto loans increased $54.3 million, or 12.4%. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in net loans acquired through the FDIC-assisted transactions of $79.7 million, or 22.0%, primarily because of loan repayments.\nRelated to the loans purchased in the 2012, 2011 and 2009 FDIC-assisted transactions, the Company originally recorded indemnification assets which represented payments expected to be received from the FDIC through loss sharing agreements. As noted previously, the loss sharing agreements for Team Bank, Vantus Bank and Sun Security Bank, and the related remaining indemnification assets were terminated during 2016. The remaining balance of the FDIC indemnification is related to InterBank, and the total amount at December 31, 2016 was $13.1 million, a decrease of $11.0 million from $24.1 million at December 31, 2015, $21.1 million of which related to InterBank. The 2014 Valley Bank acquisition did not include a loss sharing agreement with the FDIC; therefore, no indemnification asset was recorded as part of the transaction.\nSecurities available for sale decreased $49.0 million, or 18.6%, as compared to December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to calls of municipal securities and U. S. government agency securities, sales of certain mortgage-backed securities, the sale of an investment in a managed equity fund held by the Company, and normal monthly payments received related to the portfolio of mortgage-backed securities, partially offset by the purchase of certain mortgage-backed securities. The Company was required to divest the investment it held in the managed equity fund as a result of regulations recently adopted by the Federal Reserve Board. Other investment securities were reduced because they were no longer needed for pledging for public fund deposits. The available-for-sale securities portfolio was 4.7% and 6.4% of total assets at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nCash and cash equivalents were $279.8 million at December 31, 2016, an increase of $80.6 million, or 40.5%, from $199.2 million at December 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2016, cash and cash equivalents increased primarily due to the cash received in the Fifth Third Bank transaction, sales of and payments received on available-for-sale securities, increases in deposits and the net proceeds of the issuance of $75.0 million of subordinated notes. This increase in cash and cash equivalents was partially offset by using a portion of the cash to fund loan growth.\nNet premises and equipment increased $10.9 million from December 31, 2015, primarily due to the branches acquired in the Fifth Third Bank transaction, partially offset by the transfer of branch properties closed in January 2016 to other real estate owned and the sale of two branches.\nThe Company's goodwill and other intangible assets totaled $12.5 million at December 31, 2016, an increase of $6.7 million, or 117.1%, compared to $5.8 million at December 31, 2015. The increase was due to the goodwill and core deposit intangible amounts recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2016 related to the Fifth Third Bank branch acquisition, as discussed above in the \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets\" section of this report.\nTotal liabilities increased $414.9 million from $3.71 billion at December 31, 2015 to $4.12 billion at December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in deposits and the issuance of subordinated notes. Deposits increased due to the deposits assumed in the Fifth Third Bank branch transaction, as well as growth in the Company's existing deposits and brokered deposits. In the year ended December 31, 2016, total deposit balances increased $408.6 million, or 12.5%. Transaction account balances increased $212.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, while retail certificates of deposit increased $156.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nFederal Home Loan Bank advances decreased $232.0 million, from $263.5 million at December 31, 2015 to $31.5 million at December 31, 2016. The decreased advances were replaced with overnight fed funds borrowings through the FHLBank based on funding needs. As such, short-term borrowings increased by $171.0 million, from $1.3 million at December 31, 2015 to $172.3 million at December 31, 2016. The overnight fed funds borrowing rate was lower than the one week or longer term rates for FHLBank advances, so the Company elected to utilize the overnight borrowings.\nIn August 2016, the Company issued $75 million of 5.25% fixed-to-floating rate Subordinated Notes due August 15, 2026. The notes were sold at par, resulting in net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and commissions and other issuance costs, of approximately $73.5 million. The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes.\nTotal stockholders' equity increased $31.6 million from $398.2 million at December 31, 2015 to $429.8 million at December 31, 2016. The Company recorded net income of $45.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and dividends declared on common stock were $12.2 million. Accumulated other comprehensive income decreased $4.1 million. The decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income resulted from decreases in the fair value of the Company's available-for-sale investment securities. In addition, total stockholders' equity increased $2.6 million due to stock option exercises.\nResults of Operations and Comparison for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nGeneral\nNet income decreased $1.2 million, or 2.5%, during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Net income was $45.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $46.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was due to an increase in non-interest expense of $6.1 million, or 5.3%, a decrease in net interest income of $5.3 million, or 3.1%, an increase in the provision for loan losses of $3.8 million, or 68.2% and an increase in provision for income taxes of $952,000, or 6.1%, partially offset by an increase in non-interest income of $14.9 million, or 109.9%. Net income available to common shareholders was $45.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $45.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nTotal Interest Income\nTotal interest income increased $824,000, or 0.4%, during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was due to a $1.6 million, or 0.9%, increase in interest income on loans, partially offset by an $819,000, or 11.5%, decrease in interest income on investment securities and other interest-earning assets. Interest income on loans increased in 2016 due to higher average balances on loans, partially offset by lower average rates of interest. Interest income from investment securities and other interest-earning assets decreased during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to lower average balances, partially offset by higher average rates of interest.\nInterest Income - Loans\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, interest income on loans increased due to higher average balances, partially offset by lower average interest rates. Interest income increased $21.8 million as the result of higher average loan balances, which increased from $3.24 billion during the year ended December 31, 2015, to $3.66 billion during the year ended December 31, 2016. The higher average balances were primarily due to organic loan growth, in addition to the loans obtained as part of the Fifth Third Bank branch acquisition. Interest income decreased $20.2 million as the result of lower average interest rates on loans. The average yield on loans decreased from 5.48% during the year ended December 31, 2015 to 4.89% during the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was due to lower overall loan rates, and a lower amount of accretion income in the current year resulting from the increases in expected cash flows to be received from the FDIC-acquired loan pools, which is discussed in Note 4 of the accompanying audited financial statements, which are included in Item 8 of this report.\nOn an on-going basis, the Company estimates the cash flows expected to be collected from the acquired loan pools. This cash flows estimate has increased, based on the payment histories and the collection of certain loans, thereby reducing loss expectations of certain loan pools, resulting in adjustments to be spread on a level-yield basis over the remaining expected lives of the loan pools. The loss sharing agreements for the Team Bank, Vantus Bank and Sun Security Bank transactions were terminated in April 2016, and the related indemnification assets were reduced to $-0- at that time. The Valley Bank transaction does not include a loss sharing agreement with the FDIC. Therefore, for these four acquisition transactions, there is no related indemnification asset. The entire amount of the discount adjustment has been and will be accreted to interest income over time with no offsetting impact to non-interest income. For the loan pools acquired in the InterBank transaction, the increases in expected cash flows also reduce the amount of expected reimbursements under the loss sharing agreement with the FDIC, which is recorded as an indemnification asset. Therefore, the expected indemnification asset has also been reduced, resulting in adjustments to be amortized on a comparable basis over the remainder of the loss sharing agreement or the remaining expected life of the loan pools, whichever is shorter. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the adjustments increased interest income by $16.4 million and $28.5 million, respectively, and decreased non-interest income by $7.0 million and $19.5 million, respectively. The net impact to pre-tax income was $9.4 million and $9.0 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the remaining accretable yield adjustment that will affect interest income is $6.3 million and the remaining adjustment to the indemnification assets related to InterBank, including the effects of the clawback liability, that will affect non-interest income (expense) is $(2.5) million. The $6.3 million of accretable yield adjustment relates to Team Bank, Vantus Bank, Sun Security Bank, InterBank and Valley Bank. The expense, as noted, is only related to InterBank, as there is no longer, nor will there be in the future, indemnification asset amortization expense related to Team Bank, Vantus Bank or Sun Security Bank due to the early termination of the remaining related loss sharing agreements for those transactions in April 2016. Of the remaining adjustments, we expect to recognize $4.3 million of interest income and $(1.7) million of non-interest income (expense) during 2017. Additional adjustments may be recorded in future periods from the FDIC-assisted acquisitions, as the Company continues to estimate expected cash flows from the acquired loan pools. Apart from the yield accretion, the average yield on loans was 4.44% during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 4.60% during the year ended December 31, 2015, as a result of loan pay-offs, normal amortization of higher-rate loans and new loans that were made at current lower market rates. Interest income also decreased due to significant interest recoveries in the prior year period, as discussed in the paragraph below.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company collected $891,000 on certain acquired loans which had previously not been expected to be collectible. These collections were recorded as interest income in 2015 and had a positive impact on the net interest margin in that year of approximately three basis points. As the loans were subject to loss sharing agreements at that time, 80% of the amounts collected, or $713,000, was recorded in 2015 and included in non-interest income under \"accretion (amortization) of income related to business acquisitions.\"\nInterest Income - Investments and Other Interest-earning Assets\nInterest income on investments and other interest-earning assets decreased $819,000 in the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Interest income decreased $1.9 million as a result of a decrease in average balances from $483.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, to $366.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. Average balances of securities decreased due to certain U. S. government agency securities and municipal securities being called, the sale of certain mortgage-backed securities, normal monthly payments received related to the portfolio of mortgage-backed securities, and the sale during the year of an investment in a managed equity fund held by the Company. Interest income increased $1.1 million due to an increase in average interest rates from 1.47% during the year ended December 31, 2015 to 1.72% during the year ended December 31, 2016, due to a higher portion of the investment portfolio in tax-exempt municipal bonds and higher market rates of interest on other interest-bearing deposits in financial institutions.\nThe Company's interest-earning deposits and non-interest-earning cash equivalents currently earn very low or no yield and therefore negatively impact the Company's net interest margin. At December 31, 2016, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $279.8 million compared to $199.2 million at December 31, 2015. See \"Net Interest Income\" for additional information on the impact of this interest activity.\nTotal Interest Expense\nTotal interest expense increased $6.1 million, or 38.3%, during the year ended December 31, 2016, when compared with the year ended December 31, 2015, due to an increase in interest expense on deposits of $3.9 million, or 28.7%, an increase in interest expense on the newly issued subordinated notes of $1.6 million, an increase in interest expense on short-term and structured repo borrowings of $1.1 million, or 1,649.2%, and an increase in interest expense on subordinated debentures issued to capital trust of $89,000, or 12.5%, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense on FHLBank advances of $493,000, or 28.9%.\nInterest Expense - Deposits\nInterest on demand deposits increased $832,000 due to an increase in average rates from 0.20% during the year ended December 31, 2015, to 0.26% during the year ended December 31, 2016. Interest on demand deposits increased $198,000 due to an increase in average balances from $1.40 billion in the year ended December 31, 2015, to $1.50 billion in the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in average balances of interest-bearing demand deposits was primarily a result of the deposits assumed as part of the Fifth Third Bank branch acquisition, partially offset by decreases in certain deposit types, such as public funds.\nInterest expense on time deposits increased $1.8 million as a result of an increase in average rates of interest from 0.85% during the year ended December 31, 2015, to 0.98% during the year ended December 31, 2016. Interest expense on time deposits increased $1.0 million due to an increase in average balances of time deposits from $1.26 billion during the year ended December 31, 2015, to $1.37 billion during the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in average balances of time deposits was primarily a result of increased balances of brokered deposits and time deposits opened through the Company's internet deposit acquisition channels. A large portion of the Company's certificate of deposit portfolio matures within six to eighteen months and therefore reprices fairly quickly; this is consistent with the portfolio over the past several years.\nInterest Expense - FHLBank Advances, Short-term Borrowings and Structured Repurchase Agreements, Subordinated Debentures Issued to Capital Trust and Subordinated Notes\nInterest expense on FHLBank advances decreased due to lower average balances, partially offset by higher average rates of interest. Interest expense on FHLBank advances decreased $1.4 million due to a decrease in average balances from $175.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, to $68.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily due to the paydown and partial replacement of short-term FHLBank advances with overnight fed funds borrowings from the FHLBank. Partially offsetting the decrease due to reduced average balances was an increase in interest expense of $919,000 due to an increase in average interest rates from 0.97% in the year ended December 31, 2015, to 1.78% in the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in the average rate was due to a change in the mix of advances compared to the prior year. Short-term advances with very low interest rates were utilized more significantly in the prior year, which caused the overall average rate to be lower. In the current year, the Company utilized more overnight borrowings from the FHLBank which are included in short-term borrowings, with the remaining balance of FHLBank advances being longer term at a higher rate.\nInterest expense on short-term borrowings and repurchase agreements increased $996,000 due to average rates that increased from 0.03% in the year ended December 31, 2015, to 0.35% in the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was due to a change in the mix of borrowings in the current period, during which overnight fed funds borrowings from the FHLBank were increased, which are at a higher interest rate than customer repurchase agreements. Interest expense on short-term borrowings and repurchase agreements increased $76,000 due to an increase in average balances from $192.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, to $327.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, which is primarily due to an increase in short-term borrowings from the FHLBank.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, interest expense on subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts increased $168,000 due to higher average interest rates. The average interest rate was 2.48% in 2015, compared to 3.12% in 2016. The increase in the interest rate resulted from the amortization of the cost of interest rate caps the Company purchased in 2013 to limit the interest rate risk from rising LIBOR rates related to the Company's subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts. Interest expense on subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts decreased $79,000 due to a decrease in average balances from $28.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $25.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. The average balance decreased because the Company redeemed $5.0 million of its subordinated debentures issued to capital trust during 2015. The remaining debentures are variable-rate debentures which bear interest at an average rate of three-month LIBOR plus 1.60%, adjusting quarterly. The average interest rate will continue to be higher than this until the third quarter of 2017 as a result of the amortization of the cost of the interest rate cap.\nIn August 2016, the Company issued $75 million of 5.25% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due August 15, 2026. The notes were sold at par, resulting in net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and commissions and other issuance costs, of approximately $73.5 million. Interest expense on the subordinated notes for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $1.6 million.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased $5.3 million to $163.1 million compared to $168.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net interest margin was 4.05% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 4.53% in 2015, a decrease of 48 basis points. In both years, the Company's net interest income and margin have been significantly impacted by the increases in expected cash flows to be received from the FDIC-acquired loan pools and the resulting increase to accretable yield, which was discussed previously in \"Interest Income - Loans\" and is discussed in Note 4 of the accompanying audited financial statements, which are included in Item 8 of this Report. The positive impact of these changes on the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were increases in interest income of $16.4 million and $28.5 million, respectively, and increases in net interest margin of 41 basis points and 77 basis points, respectively. Excluding the positive impact of the additional yield accretion, net interest margin decreased 12 basis points during the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in net interest margin was primarily due to a decrease in average interest rate on loans (primarily due to decreased interest income on loans acquired in the FDIC-assisted transactions) and an increase in the average interest rate on time deposits and borrowings, partially offset by an increase in the average interest rate on investment securities.\nThe Company's overall interest rate spread decreased 51 basis points, or 11.5%, from 4.44% during the year ended December 31, 2015, to 3.93% during the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was due to a 36 basis point decrease in the weighted average yield on interest-earning assets and a 15 basis point increase in the weighted average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. In comparing the two years, the yield on loans decreased 59 basis points while the yield on investment securities and other interest-earning assets increased 25 basis points. The rate paid on deposits increased 10 basis points, the rate paid on FHLBank advances increased 81 basis points, the rate paid on short-term borrowings increased 32 basis points and the rate paid on subordinated debentures issued to capital trust increased 64 basis points. In addition, the new subordinated notes paid interest at an average rate of 553 basis points.\nFor additional information on net interest income components, refer to the \"Average Balances, Interest Rates and Yields\" table in this Report.\nProvision for Loan Losses and Allowance for Loan Losses\nManagement records a provision for loan losses in an amount it believes sufficient to result in an allowance for loan losses that will cover current net charge-offs as well as risks believed to be inherent in the loan portfolio of the Bank. The amount of provision charged against current income is based on several factors, including, but not limited to, past loss experience, current portfolio mix, actual and potential losses identified in the loan portfolio, economic conditions, and internal as well as external reviews. The levels of non-performing assets, potential problem loans, loan loss provisions and net charge-offs fluctuate from period to period and are difficult to predict.\nWeak economic conditions, higher inflation or interest rates, or other factors may lead to increased losses in the portfolio and/or requirements for an increase in loan loss provision expense. Management maintains various controls in an attempt to limit future losses, such as a watch list of possible problem loans, documented loan administration policies and a loan review staff to review the quality and anticipated collectability of the portfolio. Additional procedures provide for frequent management review of the loan portfolio based on loan size, loan type, delinquencies, financial analysis, on-going correspondence with borrowers and problem loan work-outs. Management determines which loans are potentially uncollectible, or represent a greater risk of loss, and makes additional provisions to expense, if necessary, to maintain the allowance at a satisfactory level.\nThe provision for loan losses increased $3.8 million, to $9.3 million, during the year ended December 31, 2016, when compared with the year ended December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016, the allowance for loan losses was $37.4 million, a decrease of $749,000 from December 31, 2015. Total net charge-offs were $10.0 million and $5.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Excluding those related to loans covered by loss sharing agreements, six relationships made up $5.5 million of the total $10.0 million in net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2016. Gross charge-offs for the year were partially offset by recoveries, including recoveries on two separate relationships totaling $1.1 million, which had previously been charged off. During the year ended December 31, 2016, $3.8 million of the $10.0 million of net charge-offs were in the consumer auto category. General market conditions and unique circumstances related to individual borrowers and projects contributed to the level of provisions and charge-offs. As properties were categorized as potential problem loans, non-performing loans or foreclosed assets, evaluations were made of the values of these assets with corresponding charge-offs as appropriate.\nAt December 31, 2016, loans acquired in the InterBank FDIC-assisted transaction were covered by a loss sharing agreement between the FDIC and Great Southern Bank, which affords Great Southern Bank at least 80% protection from losses in the acquired portfolio of loans. The FDIC loss sharing agreement is subject to limitations on the types of losses covered and the length of time losses are covered and is conditioned upon the Bank complying with its requirements in the agreement with the FDIC. These limitations are described in detail in Note 4 of the accompanying financial statements, which are included in Item 8 of this report. In April 2016, the loss sharing agreements for Team Bank, Vantus Bank and Sun Security Bank were terminated. Loans acquired from the FDIC related to Valley Bank did not have a loss sharing agreement. All acquired loans were grouped into pools based on common characteristics and were recorded at their estimated fair values, which incorporated estimated credit losses at the acquisition date. These loan pools are systematically reviewed by the Company to determine the risk of losses that may exceed those identified at the time of the acquisition. Techniques used in determining risk of loss are similar to those used to determine the risk of loss for the legacy Great Southern Bank portfolio, with most focus being placed on those loan pools which include the larger loan relationships and those loan pools which exhibit higher risk characteristics. Review of the acquired loan portfolio also includes meetings with customers, review of financial information and collateral valuations to determine if any additional losses are apparent.\nThe allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans, excluding acquired covered and non-covered loans, was 1.04% and 1.20% at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover losses inherent in the Company's loan portfolio at December 31, 2016, based on recent reviews of the Company's loan portfolio and current economic conditions. If economic conditions were to deteriorate or management's assessment of the loan portfolio were to change, it is possible that additional loan loss provisions would be required, thereby adversely affecting future results of operations and financial condition.\nNon-performing Assets\nFormer TeamBank, Vantus Bank, Sun Security Bank and InterBank non-performing assets, including foreclosed assets and potential problem loans, are not included in the totals or in the discussion of non-performing loans, potential problem loans and foreclosed assets below as they are, or were, subject to loss sharing agreements with the FDIC, which cover at least 80% of principal losses that may be incurred in these portfolios for the applicable terms under the agreements. In addition, these assets were initially recorded at their estimated fair values as of their acquisition dates. The overall performance of the loan pools acquired in 2009, 2011 and 2012 in FDIC-assisted transactions has been better than original expectations as of the acquisition dates. Former Valley Bank loans are also excluded from the totals and the discussion of non-performing loans, potential problem loans and foreclosed assets below, although they are not covered by a loss sharing agreement. Former Valley Bank loans are accounted for in pools and were recorded at their fair value at the time of the acquisition; therefore, these loan pools are analyzed rather than the individual loans.\nAs previously discussed, the remaining loss sharing agreements for Team Bank, Vantus Bank and Sun Security Bank were terminated in April 2016. Loss sharing agreements covering single-family loans and foreclosed assets and non-single-family loans and foreclosed assets related to the Inter Savings Bank FDIC-assisted acquisition are still in place in accordance with their contractual terms.\nAs a result of changes in balances and composition of the loan portfolio, changes in economic and market conditions that occur from time to time, and other factors specific to a borrower's circumstances, the level of non-performing assets will fluctuate.\nNon-performing assets, excluding FDIC-covered and formerly covered non-performing assets and other FDIC-assisted acquired assets, at December 31, 2016, were $39.3 million, a decrease of $4.7 from $44.0 million at December 31, 2015. Non-performing assets, excluding FDIC-covered and formerly covered non-performing assets and other FDIC-assisted acquired assets, as a percentage of total assets were 0.86% at December 31, 2016, compared to 1.07% at December 31, 2015.\nCompared to December 31, 2015, non-performing loans decreased $2.5 million to $14.1 million at December 31, 2016, and foreclosed assets decreased $2.1 million to $25.2 million at December 31, 2016. Non-performing commercial real estate loans comprised $4.4 million, or 31.3%, of the total of $14.1 million of non-performing loans at December 31, 2016. The majority of the decrease in the commercial real estate category was due to one relationship where the notes were sold and the loans paid off after charge-offs of $2.0 million during 2016. Another relationship totaling $982,000 was transferred to foreclosed assets. In addition, $3.1 million of the transfers to foreclosed assets in the commercial real estate category and approximately $670,000 of the charge-offs were related to another relationship. Non-performing commercial business loans were $3.1 million, or 21.9%, of total non-performing loans at December 31, 2016. The increase in non-performing commercial business loans was primarily due to the addition of one relationship in 2016. Non-performing consumer loans were $2.6 million, or 18.7%, of total non-performing loans at December 31, 2016. Non-performing one-to four-family residential loans comprised $2.0 million, or 13.9%, of the total non-performing loans at December 31, 2016. Non-performing land development loans were $1.7 million, or 12.2%, of total non-performing loans at December 31, 2016. The increase in non-performing land development loans was primarily due to the addition of one relationship in 2016.\nNon-performing Loans. Activity in the non-performing loans category during the year ended December 31, 2016, was as follows:\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Beginning\nBalance,\nJanuary 1\n</td> <td>

year. The largest relationship in this category, which was added prior to 2016, totaled $1.7 million, or 38.5% of the total category, and is collateralized by a theatre property in Branson, Mo. One relationship in this category, which had a balance of $6.5 million at December 31, 2015, had $2.0 million in charge-offs and $5.1 million in payments (net of operating funds advanced) during the year. The relationship was collateralized by three operating long-term health care facilities in Missouri. These related notes were sold during 2016 for payment of the amount of the remaining balances after the charge-offs, resulting in a balance of zero at December 31, 2016. During 2016, $3.1 million of the transfers to foreclosed assets in the commercial real estate category and approximately $670,000 of the charge-offs were related to another relationship. This relationship is secured by property located in the Branson, Mo., area, and includes a lakefront resort, marina and related amenities, condominiums and lots. In addition to those relationships already discussed, $3.8 million of the transfers to foreclosed assets in the commercial real estate category during the year related to three additional relationships. The non-performing commercial business category included five loans, four of which were added during 2016. The largest loan in this category, which was added in 2016, totaled $3.0 million, or 95.6% of the total category, and is secured by the borrower's interest in a condo project in Branson, Mo. The Bank's lending involvement with this project dates back to 2005. This project had experienced some performance difficulties in the past and a new borrower became involved in this project during 2013. The non-performing one- to four-family residential category included 38 loans, 27 of which were added during 2016. The non-performing land development category included two loans. The largest loan in this category, which was originated in 2007, totaled $1.6 million, or 95.1% of the total category, and was collateralized by land in the St. Louis, Mo. area. The non-performing consumer category included 188 loans, 174 of which were added during 2016.\nForeclosed Assets. Of the total $32.7 million of other real estate owned at December 31, 2016, $1.4 million represents the fair value of foreclosed assets covered by FDIC loss sharing agreements, $316,000 represents the fair value of foreclosed assets previously covered by FDIC loss sharing agreements, $2.0 million represents foreclosed assets related to Valley Bank and not covered by loss sharing agreements, $9,000 represents other repossessed assets related to acquired loans, and $3.7 million represents properties which were not acquired through foreclosure, including former branch locations that have been closed and are held for sale and land which\nwas acquired for a potential branch location . The acquired loss share covered and non-covered foreclosed and other assets acquired in the FDIC-assisted transactions and the properties not acquired through foreclosure are not included in the following table and discussion of other real estate owned. Because sales of foreclosed properties exceeded additions, total foreclosed assets decreased. Activity in foreclosed assets during the year ended December 31, 2016, was as follows:\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Beginning\nBalance,\nJanuary 1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Additions\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Proceeds\nfrom Sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Capitalized\nCosts\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> ORE Expense\nWrite-Downs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Ending\nBalance,\nDecember 31\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (In Thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> One- to four-family construction\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subdivision construction\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7,016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (362\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (294\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,360\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Land development\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12,133\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1,247\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10,886\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial construction\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> One- to four-family residential\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,375\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (435\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (200\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,217\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other residential\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,150\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1,252\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (90\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial real estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,608\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7,094\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (6,170\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (691\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,841\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial business\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,109\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 13,332\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (12,450\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,991\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 27,391\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,903\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (21,916\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,275\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,249\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2016, the land development category of foreclosed assets included 22 properties, the largest of which was located in northwest Arkansas and had a balance of $1.4 million, or 12.6% of the total category. Of the total dollar amount in the land development category of foreclosed assets, 39.1% and 33.1% was located in the Branson, Mo. area and in the northwest Arkansas area, respectively, including the largest property previously mentioned. The subdivision construction category of foreclosed assets included 27 properties, the largest of which was located in the Springfield, Mo. metropolitan area and had a balance of $1.2 million, or 19.4% of the total category. Of the total dollar amount in the subdivision construction category of foreclosed assets, 29.4% and 19.4% is located in Branson, Mo. and Springfield, Mo., respectively, including the largest property previously mentioned. The commercial real estate category of foreclosed assets included six properties. The largest relationship in the commercial real estate category, which includes two properties which were added during 2016, totaled $1.5 million, or 39.6% of the total category, and is made up of commercial retail property in Texas and Georgia, which was previously in non-performing loans. The second largest relationship in the commercial real estate category, which was added during 2016, totaled $1.3 million, or 33.3% of the total category, and is a hotel located in the western United States, which was previously in non-performing loans. The $6.2 million in sales in the commercial real estate category of foreclosed assets was primarily from three properties. Sales of $2.1 million related to a property which is located in southeast Missouri and was added in 2015. Sales of $2.9 million related to a property located in the Branson, Mo., area, and included a lakefront resort, marina and related amenities, condominiums and lots. Sales of $982,000 related to a motel property located in Springfield, Mo. The one-to four-family residential category of foreclosed assets included nine properties, of which the largest relationship, with one property in the southwest Missouri area, had a balance of $421,000, or 34.6% of the total category. Of the total dollar amount in the one-to- four-family category of foreclosed assets, 44.4% is located in the Branson, Mo., area. The other residential category of foreclosed assets included five properties, four of which were part of the same condominium community, located in Branson, Mo. and had a balance of $694,000, or 72.7% of the total category. The sales of $1.3 million in the other residential category were from six additional properties that were part of the same condominium community which were sold during 2016. The larger amount of additions and sales under consumer loans are due to a higher volume of repossessions of automobiles, which generally are subject to a shorter repossession process. Compared to previous years, in 2016 the Company experienced increased levels of delinquencies and repossessions in consumer loans, primarily indirect used automobile loans.\nPotential Problem Loans. Potential problem loans decreased $5.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, from $12.8 million at December 31, 2015 to $7.0 million at December 31, 2016. This decrease was due to $6.0 million in loans transferred to the non-performing category, $2.6 million in loans removed from potential problem loans due to improvements in the credits, $2.2 million in charge-offs, $65,000 in loans transferred to foreclosed assets, and $3.4 million in payments on potential problem loans, partially offset by the addition of $8.5 million of loans to potential problem loans. Potential problem loans are loans which management has identified through routine internal review procedures as having possible credit problems that may cause the borrowers difficulty in complying with current repayment terms. These loans are not reflected in non-performing assets, but are considered in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Activity in the potential problem loans category during the year ended December 31, 2016, was as follows:\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Beginning\nBalance,\nJanuary 1\n</td> <td>

These relationships are discussed above under non-performing loans. Of the $1.4 million in payments in this category, 95% was related to one loan, which was paid in full during 2016. The other residential category of potential problem loans has a balance of zero at December 31, 2016. During the year, payment was received in full on one loan which was previously included in the other residential category of potential problem loans totaling $2.0 million. This loan was to the same borrower that was referenced above in the land development category.\nNon-Interest Income\nNon-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $28.5 million compared with $13.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of $14.9 million, or 109.9 %, was primarily the result of the following items:\nAmortization of income related to business acquisitions: The net amortization expense related to business acquisitions was reduced to $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2016, consisted of the following items: $5.8 million of amortization expense related to the changes in cash flows expected to be collected from the FDIC-covered loan portfolios, $584,000 of impairment to certain indemnification assets and $1.4 million of amortization of the clawback liability. The impairment of the indemnification asset was recorded pursuant to the expected loss on the FDIC loss share termination agreements that occurred in April 2016, as discussed in the Company's March 31, 2016 Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Partially offsetting the expense was income from the accretion of the discount related to the indemnification asset for the InterBank acquisition of $896,000.\nNet realized gains on sales of available-for-sale securities: During 2016, the Company sold an investment held at the holding company level for a gain of $2.7 million. This investment, the original amount of which was $1.0 million, was made in a managed equity fund. The Company was required to divest this investment as a result of recent regulations enacted by the Federal Reserve Board. There were no material gains on sales of investments in 2015.\nService charges and ATM fees: Service charges and ATM fees increased $1.8 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to the additional accounts acquired in the Fifth Third Bank transaction in January 2016, which have had high levels of debit card activity, and overall higher levels of point-of-sale card activity.\nOther income: Other income decreased $918,000 compared to the prior year. During 2015, the Company recorded a $1.1 million gain when it redeemed the trust preferred securities previously issued by Great Southern Capital Trust III at a discount. Also in 2015,\nthe Company sold a banking center building in Nebraska at a net gain of $671,000. In addition, during 2015, the Company recognized a $300,000 gain on the sale of a non-marketable investment. The Company recognized a $257,000 gain on the sale of the Thayer, Mo., branch and deposits during the first quarter of 2016 and a $110,000 gain was recognized on the sale of the Buffalo, Mo., branch and deposits during the first quarter of 2016. In addition, in 2016, a gain of $238,000 was recognized on sales of fixed assets unrelated to the branch sales.\nNon-Interest Expense\nTotal non-interest expense increased $6.0 million, or 5.3%, from $114.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, to $120.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. The Company's efficiency ratio for the year ended December 31, 2016 was 62.86%, slightly higher than the 62.85% in 2015. The 2016 ratio was negatively affected by the increase in non-interest expense and the decrease in net interest income, offset by an increase in non-interest income. The Company's ratio of non-interest expense to average assets decreased from 2.81% for the year ended December 31, 2015, to 2.76% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in the current year ratio was due to the increase in average assets in 2016 compared to 2015, partially offset by the increase in non-interest expense. Average assets for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased $303.4 million, or 7.5%, from the year ended December 31, 2015. The following were key items related to the increase in non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015:\nFifth Third Bank branch acquisition expenses: The Company incurred approximately $1.4 million of expenses during 2016 related to the acquisition of certain branches of Fifth Third Bank, versus approximately $482,000 in acquisition related expenses in the prior year. Those expenses for 2016 (net of prior year expense, if applicable), included approximately $317,000 of legal, audit and other professional fees expense, approximately $294,000 of computer license and support expense, approximately $436,000 in charges to replace former Fifth Third Bank customer checks with Great Southern Bank checks, and approximately $54,000 of travel, meals and other expenses related to the transaction and similar costs incurred during the year. A number of these increases are discussed in the related categories below.\nSalaries and employee benefits: Salaries and employee benefits increased $1.7 million over the prior year period. Salaries increased due to additional employee costs related to the branches acquired from Fifth Third Bank during the first quarter of 2016 ($2.3 million during 2016), which was partially offset by the reduction in expenses related to the 16 banking centers which were closed or sold during the first quarter of 2016 ($1.7 million during the prior year). The remaining increase was due to increased staffing due to growth in lending and other operational areas.\nExpense on foreclosed assets: Expense on foreclosed assets increased $1.6 million compared to the prior year due to expenses and valuation write-downs of foreclosed assets, and the loss on final disposition of certain assets during the current year. During 2016, expenses and loss on final disposition of two related properties totaling $320,000 were incurred. In addition, approximately $912,000 in valuation write-downs, primarily related to these two properties, were taken during 2016. Collection expenses and losses on sales of non-real estate assets (primarily automobiles) increased $652,000 in 2016 compared to 2015. The Company has increased its consumer lending, primarily in indirect automobile lending, significantly in the past few years. The Company does not currently expect significant increases in this type of lending in future periods.\nOther operating expenses: Other operating expenses increased $1.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015. Of this amount, $436,000 relates to check charges to replace Fifth Third customer checks as part of the acquisition in the first quarter of 2016. There was also increased expense due to higher levels of debit card and check fraud losses in 2016. These losses totaled $1.9 million in 2016 compared to $619,000 in 2015. A large portion of the increase related to debit card fraud that resulted from a data security breach at a national retail merchant which operates stores in many of our markets, affecting some of our debit card customers who transacted business with the merchant. The losses incurred by the Company resulted from regulatory requirements that banks reimburse debit card customers for unauthorized transactions. In regard to this particular merchant breach, we currently believe that further loss exposure will not be significant.\nLegal, audit and other professional fees: Legal, audit and other professional fees increased $478,000 from the prior year due to legal and professional fees related to the Fifth Third transaction, legal fees related to the resolution of two large non-performing loan relationships, and increased audit and accounting fees.\nSupplies expense: Supplies expense increased $375,000 compared to the prior year primarily due to approximately $318,000 of one-time costs incurred to stock a supply of chip-enabled debit cards. In October 2016, the Company began mass issuing chip-enabled debit cards to its deposit customer base.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe Company's effective tax rate was 26.7% and 25.1% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which was lower than the statutory federal tax rate of 35%, due primarily to the utilization of certain investment tax credits and to tax-exempt investments and tax-exempt loans which reduced the Company's effective tax rate. In future periods, the Company expects its effective tax rate typically will be 26-28% of pre-tax net income, assuming it continues to maintain or increase its use of investment tax credits and maintain or increase its pre-tax net income. The Company's effective tax rate may fluctuate as it is impacted by the level and timing of the Company's utilization of tax credits and the level of tax-exempt investments and loans and the overall level of pretax income.\nAverage Balances, Interest Rates and Yields\nThe following table presents, for the periods indicated, the total dollar amount of interest income from average interest-earning assets and the resulting yields, as well as the interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities, expressed both in dollars and rates, and the net interest margin. Average balances of loans receivable include the average balances of non-accrual loans for each period. Interest income on loans includes interest received on non-accrual loans on a cash basis. Interest income on loans includes the amortization of net loan fees which were deferred in accordance with accounting standards. Fees included in interest income were $5.0 million, $4.4 million and $3.2 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Tax-exempt income was not calculated on a tax equivalent basis. The table does not reflect any effect of income taxes.\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Dec. 31, 2016(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n</td> <td>

(1) Of the total average balances of investment securities, average tax-exempt investment securities were $72.0 million, $79.9 million and $87.9 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In addition, average tax-exempt industrial revenue bonds were $32.0 million, $36.1 million and $38.5 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Interest income on tax-exempt assets included in this table was $3.8 million, $4.4 million and $5.2 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Interest income net of disallowed interest expense related to tax-exempt assets was $3.7 million, $4.2 million and $5.0 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. (2) The yield/rate on loans at December 31, 2016 does not include the impact of the accretable yield (income) on loans acquired in the FDIC-assisted transactions. See \"Net Interest Income\" for a discussion of the effect on 2016 results of operations. \nRate/Volume Analysis\nThe following table presents the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for major components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for the periods shown. For each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, information is provided on changes attributable to (i) changes in rate (i.e., changes in rate multiplied by old volume) and (ii) changes in volume (i.e., changes in volume multiplied by old rate). For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately to volume and rate.

increased $3.0 million, or 6.8%, during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Net income was $46.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $43.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was due to an increase in net interest income of $793,000, or 0.5% and a decrease in non-interest expense of $6.5 million, or 5.4%, partially offset by an increase in provision for income taxes of $1.8 million, or 13.2%, an increase in the provision for loan losses of $1.4 million, or 33.0% and a decrease in non-interest income of $1.2 million, or 7.8%. Non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2014 included a gain recognized on business acquisition of $10.8 million. Net income available to common shareholders was $45.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $43.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nTotal Interest Income\nTotal interest income increased $989,000, or 0.5%, during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was due to a $4.7 million, or 2.7%, increase in interest income on loans, partially offset by a $3.7 million, or 34.1%, decrease in interest income on investments and other interest-earning assets. Interest income on loans increased in 2015 due to higher average balances on loans, partially offset by lower average rates of interest. Interest income from investment securities and other interest-earning assets decreased during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to lower average balances. The lower average balances of investments were primarily due to the sale of certain mortgage-backed securities, and as a result of management's decision to not reinvest mortgage-backed securities' monthly cash flows and proceeds of sales back into investments, but to utilize the proceeds to fund a portion of our loan growth. Prepayments on the mortgages underlying these securities resulted in amortization of premiums\nwhich also reduced yields. Interest income on loans is affected by variations in the adjustments to accretable yield due to increases in expected cash flows to be received from the FDIC-acquired loan pools as discussed below in \"Interest Income - Loans\" and in Note 4 of the accompanying audited financial statements, which are included in Item 8 of this Report. In 2015, many higher yielding loans matured or were repaid. These loans were replaced with new loans that were generally at rates lower than those that repaid during the year, resulting in lower overall yields in the loan portfolio. Higher average balances of loans more than offset the lower interest yield on loans.\nInterest Income - Loans\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, interest income on loans increased due to higher average balances, partially offset by lower average interest rates. Interest income increased $26.1 million as a result of higher average loan balances which increased from $2.78 billion during the year ended December 31, 2014 to $3.24 billion during the year ended December 31, 2015. The higher average balances were primarily due to increases in commercial construction loans, consumer loans, commercial real estate loans, other residential loans and owner occupied one- to four-family residential loan categories. A portion of this average balance increase resulted from the Company acquiring $165.1 million in loans (net of discounts) as part of the Valley Bank FDIC-assisted transaction on June 20, 2014, the aggregate balance of which was $93.4 million (net of discounts) at December 31, 2015.\nInterest income decreased $21.4 million as the result of lower average interest rates on loans. The average yield on loans decreased from 6.20% during the year ended December 31, 2014 to 5.48% during the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was due to lower overall loan rates, and a lower amount of accretion income in the current year in conjunction with the fair value of the loan pools acquired in the FDIC-assisted transactions, as the additional yield accretion was lower in 2015 compared to 2014. On an on-going basis, the Company estimates the cash flows expected to be collected from the acquired loan pools. This cash flows estimate has increased, based on the payment histories and reduced loss expectations of the loan pools, resulting in adjustments to be spread on a level-yield basis over the remaining expected lives of the loan pools. For the loan pools acquired in the 2009, 2011 and 2012 FDIC-assisted transactions, the increases in expected cash flows also reduced the amount of expected reimbursements under the loss sharing agreements with the FDIC, which are recorded as indemnification assets. Therefore, the expected indemnification assets have also been reduced, resulting in adjustments to be amortized on a comparable basis over the remainder of the loss sharing agreements or the remaining expected life of the loan pools, whichever is shorter. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the adjustments increased interest income by $28.5 million and $35.0 million, respectively, and decreased non-interest income by $19.5 million and $28.7 million, respectively. The net impact to pre-tax income was $9.0 million and $6.2 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. As of December 31, 2015, the remaining accretable yield adjustment that will affect interest income is $12.0 million and the remaining adjustment to the indemnification assets, including the effects of the clawback liability related to InterBank, that will affect non-interest income (expense) is $(8.6) million. Of the remaining adjustments, we expect to recognize $9.1 million of interest income and $(6.0) million of non-interest income (expense) during 2016. Additional adjustments may be recorded in future periods from the FDIC-assisted transactions, as the Company continues to estimate expected cash flows from the acquired loan pools. Apart from the yield accretion, the average yield on loans was 4.60% for the year ended December 31, 2015, down from 4.94% for the year ended December 31, 2014, as a result of loan pay-offs and normal amortization of higher-rate loans and new loans that were made at current lower market rates.\nIn addition, the Company's net interest margin has been positively impacted by additional yield accretion recognized in conjunction with updated estimates of the fair value of the loan pools acquired in the June 2014 Valley Bank FDIC-assisted transaction. Beginning with the three months ended December 31, 2014, the cash flow estimates have increased for certain of the Valley Bank loan pools primarily based on significant loan repayments and also due to collection of certain loans, thereby reducing loss expectations on certain of the loan pools. This resulted in increased income that was spread on a level-yield basis over the remaining expected lives of these loan pools. The Valley Bank transaction does not include a loss sharing agreement with the FDIC. Therefore, there is no related indemnification asset. The entire amount of the discount adjustment will be accreted to interest income over time with no offsetting impact to non-interest income. The amount of the Valley Bank discount adjustment accreted to interest income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $5.7 million, and is included in the impact on net interest income/net interest margin amount discussed above. Based on current estimates, we anticipate recording additional interest income accretion of $3.0 million during 2016 related to these Valley Bank loan pools.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company collected $891,000 from customers on loans which had previously not been expected to be collectible. In accordance with the Company's accounting methodology, these collections were accounted for as increases in estimated cash flows and were recorded as interest income, thereby increasing net interest income and net interest margin. These collections related to acquired loans which were subject to loss sharing agreements with the FDIC; therefore, 80% of the amounts collected, or $713,000, was owed to the FDIC. This $713,000 of expense is included in non-interest income under \"accretion (amortization) of income related to business acquisitions.\"\nInterest Income - Investments and Other Interest-earning Assets\nInterest income on investments decreased $3.4 million as a result of a decrease in average balances from $495.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, to $330.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Average balances of securities decreased due to sales of certain mortgage-backed securities, normal monthly payments received related to the portfolio of mortgage-backed securities, and calls and maturities of maturities of municipal securities. The investment securities were reduced because they were no longer needed for pledging. Interest income on investments decreased $272,000 as a result of a decrease in average interest rates from 2.11% during the year ended December 31, 2014 to 2.06% during the year ended December 31, 2015. The majority of the Company's securities in 2014 and 2015 were mortgage-backed securities which are backed by hybrid ARMs that have fixed rates of interest for a period of time (generally one to ten years) and then adjust annually. The actual amount of securities that reprice and the actual interest rate changes on these securities are subject to the level of prepayments on these securities and the changes that actually occur in market interest rates (primarily treasury rates and LIBOR rates). Mortgage-backed securities are also subject to reduced yields due to more rapid prepayments in the underlying mortgages. As a result, premiums on these securities may be amortized against interest income more quickly, thereby reducing the yield recorded.\nInterest income on other interest-earning assets decreased $62,000 mainly due to lower average balances from $185.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, to $152.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Average balances of interest-earning deposits decreased primarily due to the use of excess liquidity to fund a portion of the Company's loan growth. The Company's interest-earning deposits and non-interest-earning cash equivalents currently earn very low or no yield and therefore negatively impact the Company's net interest margin. At December 31, 2015, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $199.2 million compared to $218.6 million at December 31, 2014. See \"Net Interest Income\" for additional information on the impact of this interest activity.\nTotal Interest Expense\nTotal interest expense increased $196,000, or 1.2%, during the year ended December 31, 2015, when compared with the year ended December 31, 2014, due to an increase in interest expense on deposits of $2.3 million, or 20.4% and an increase in interest expense on subordinated debentures issued to capital trust of $147,000, or 25.9%, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense on FHLBank advances of $1.2 million, or 41.3%, and a decrease in interest expense on short-term and structured repo borrowings of $1.0 million, or 94.1%.\nInterest Expense - Deposits\nInterest on demand deposits decreased $176,000 due to a decrease in average rates from 0.22% during the year ended December 31, 2014, to 0.20% during the year ended December 31, 2015. Interest on demand deposits decreased $54,000 due to a small decrease in average balances from $1.43 billion in the year ended December 31, 2014, to $1.40 billion in the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in average balances of interest-bearing demand deposits was primarily a result of a decrease in public funds deposits. Average noninterest-bearing demand balances increased from $535 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, to $542 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nInterest expense on time deposits increased $1.8 million due to an increase in average balances of time deposits from $1.04 billion during the year ended December 31, 2014, to $1.26 billion during the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in average balances of time deposits was primarily a result of increased balances of brokered deposits and time deposits opened through the Company's internet deposit acquisition channels. The increase in time deposit balances was also due to the deposits acquired in the Valley Bank transaction on June 20, 2014. Interest expense on time deposits increased $741,000 as a result of an increase in average rates of interest from 0.78% during the year ended December 31, 2014, to 0.85% during the year ended December 31, 2015. A large portion of the Company's certificate of deposit portfolio matures within six to eighteen months and therefore reprices fairly quickly; this is consistent with the portfolio over the past several years.\nInterest Expense - FHLBank Advances, Short-term Borrowings and Structured Repurchase Agreements and Subordinated Debentures Issued to Capital Trust\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, interest expense on FHLBank advances decreased due to lower average rates of interest, partially offset by slightly higher average balances. Interest expense on FHLBank advances decreased $1.3 million due to a decrease in average interest rates from 1.69% in the year ended December 31, 2014, to 0.97% in the year ended December 31, 2015. The significant decrease in the average rate was due to the repayment of $80 million of the Company's long-term higher-rate FHLBank advances in June 2014. As of December 31, 2015, $232 million of the Company's $264 million of total FHLBank advances are short-term advances with very low interest rates. Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in interest expense on FHLBank advances of $64,000 due to an increase in average balances from $172.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, to $175.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily due to additional short-term FHLBank advances obtained by the Company during 2015 to fund loan growth and for other short term funding needs.\nInterest expense on short-term and structured repo borrowings decreased $1.1 million due to a decrease in average rates on short-term borrowings from 0.58% in the year ended December 31, 2014, to 0.03% in the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company repaid $50 million of structured repurchase agreements in June 2014. As there were no higher-rate structured repurchase agreements during 2015, the average rate decreased significantly because the interest expense was all related to the lower-rate securities sold under repurchase agreements with customers. Partially offsetting that decrease, interest expense on short-term borrowings and structured repurchase agreements increased $18,000 due to an increase in average balances from $188.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, to $192.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, interest expense on subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts increased $189,000 due to higher average interest rates. The average interest rate was 1.83% in 2014, compared to 2.48% in 2015. The increase in the interest rate resulted from the amortization of the cost of interest rate caps the Company purchased in 2013 to limit the interest rate risk from rising LIBOR rates related to the Company's subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts. Interest expense on subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts decreased $42,000 due to a decrease in average balances from $30.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $28.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The average balance decreased because the Company redeemed $5.0 million of its subordinated debentures issued to capital trust during 2015. Additional information regarding this transaction is provided in Note 13 of the accompanying audited financial statements, which are included in Item 8 of this Report. The remaining debentures are variable-rate debentures which bear interest at an average rate of three-month LIBOR plus 1.60%, adjusting quarterly. The average interest rate will continue to be higher than this until the third quarter of 2017 as a result of the amortization of the cost of the interest rate cap.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $793,000 to $168.4 million compared to $167.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Net interest margin was 4.53% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 4.84% in 2014, a decrease of 31 basis points. The Company's net interest income and margin have been significantly impacted by additional yield accretion recognized in conjunction with updated estimates of the fair value of the loan pools acquired in the 2009, 2011 and 2012 FDIC-assisted transactions. The Company's margin was positively impacted in both years by the increases in expected cash flows to be received from the loan pools acquired in the FDIC-assisted transactions and the resulting increases to accretable yield which was discussed previously in \"Interest Income - Loans\" and is discussed in Note 4 of the accompanying audited financial statements, which are included in Item 8 of this Report. The impact of these changes on the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were increases in interest income of $28.5 million and $35.0 million, respectively, and increases in net interest margin of 77 basis points and 101 basis points, respectively. Excluding the positive impact of the additional yield accretion, net interest margin decreased 7 basis points during the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in net interest margin was primarily due to a decrease in average interest rate on loans and an increase in the average interest rate on time deposits.\nThe Company's overall interest rate spread decreased 30 basis points, or 6.3%, from 4.74% during the year ended December 31, 2014, to 4.44% during the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was due to a 33 basis point decrease in the weighted average yield on interest-earning assets, partially offset by a three basis point decrease in the weighted average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. In comparing the two years, the yield on loans decreased 72 basis points while the yield on investment securities and other interest-earning assets decreased 12 basis points. The rate paid on deposits increased six basis points, the rate paid on FHLBank advances decreased 72 basis points, the rate paid on short-term borrowings decreased 55 basis points and the rate paid on subordinated debentures issued to capital trust increased 65 basis points.\nFor additional information on net interest income components, refer to the \"Average Balances, Interest Rates and Yields\" table in this Report.\nProvision for Loan Losses and Allowance for Loan Losses\nThe provision for loan losses increased $1.4 million to $5.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, when compared with the year ended December 31, 2014. At December 31, 2015, the allowance for loan losses was $38.1 million, a decrease of $286,000 from December 31, 2014. Total net charge-offs were $5.8 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Excluding those related to loans covered by loss sharing agreements, five relationships made up $2.6 million of the total $5.8 million in net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2015. General market conditions and unique circumstances related to individual borrowers and projects also contributed to the level of provisions and charge-offs. As properties were categorized as potential problem loans, non-performing loans or foreclosed assets, evaluations were made of the values of these assets with corresponding charge-offs as appropriate.\nExcept for those loans acquired in the TeamBank and Vantus Bank transactions for which the loss sharing agreements have ended (i.e., non-single family real estate loans), loans acquired in the 2009, 2011 and 2012 FDIC-assisted transactions are covered by loss sharing agreements between the FDIC and Great Southern Bank which afford Great Southern Bank at least 80% protection from losses in the acquired portfolio of loans. The FDIC loss sharing agreements are subject to limitations on the types of losses covered and the length\nof time losses are covered and are conditioned upon the Bank complying with its requirements in the agreements with the FDIC. These limitations are described in detail in Note 4 of the accompanying audited financial statements, which are included in Item 8 of this Report. These acquired loans were grouped into pools based on common characteristics and were recorded at their estimated fair values, which incorporated estimated credit losses at the acquisition dates. These loan pools are systematically reviewed by the Company to determine the risk of losses that may exceed those identified at the time of the acquisition. Techniques used in determining risk of loss are similar to those used to determine the risk of loss for the legacy Great Southern Bank portfolio, with most focus being placed on those loan pools which include the larger loan relationships and those loan pools which exhibit higher risk characteristics. Review of the acquired loan portfolio also includes meetings with customers, review of financial information and collateral valuations to determine if any additional losses are apparent. Former Valley Bank loans, which were also acquired in an FDIC-assisted transaction, are accounted for in pools and were recorded at their fair value at the time of the acquisition as of June 20, 2014; therefore, these loan pools are analyzed rather than the individual loans.\nThe Bank's allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans, excluding loans covered by the FDIC loss sharing agreements, was 1.20% and 1.34% at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover losses inherent in the Company's loan portfolio at December 31, 2015, based on recent reviews of the Company's loan portfolio and current economic conditions. If economic conditions were to deteriorate or management's assessment of the loan portfolio were to change, it is possible that additional loan loss provisions would be required, thereby adversely affecting future results of operations and financial condition.\nNon-performing Assets\nFormer TeamBank, Vantus Bank, Sun Security Bank and InterBank non-performing assets, including foreclosed assets, are not included in the totals or in the discussion of non-performing loans, potential problem loans and foreclosed assets below as they are, or were, subject to loss sharing agreements with the FDIC, which cover at least 80% of principal losses that may be incurred in these portfolios for the applicable terms under the agreements. At December 31, 2015, there were no material non-performing assets that were previously covered, and are now not covered, under the TeamBank or Vantus Bank non-single-family loss sharing agreements. In addition, FDIC-supported TeamBank, Vantus Bank, Sun Security Bank and InterBank assets were initially recorded at their estimated fair values as of their acquisition dates of March 20, 2009, September 4, 2009, October 7, 2011, and April 27, 2012, respectively. The overall performance of the FDIC-covered loan pools acquired in 2009, 2011 and 2012 has been better than original expectations as of the acquisition dates. Former Valley Bank loans are also excluded from the totals and the discussion of non-performing loans, potential problem loans and foreclosed assets below, although they are not covered by a loss sharing agreement.\nThe loss sharing agreement for the non-single-family portion of the loans acquired in the TeamBank transaction ended on March 31, 2014. Any additional losses in that non-single-family portfolio will not be eligible for loss sharing coverage. At this time, the Company does not expect any material losses in this non-single-family loan portfolio, which totaled $16.2 million, net of discounts, at December 31, 2015.\nThe loss sharing agreement for the non-single-family portion of the loans acquired in the Vantus Bank transaction ended on September 30, 2014. Any additional losses in that non-single-family portfolio will not be eligible for loss sharing coverage. At this time, the Company does not expect any material losses in this non-single-family loan portfolio, which totaled $17.1 million, net of discounts, at December 31, 2015.\nAs a result of changes in balances and composition of the loan portfolio, changes in economic and market conditions that occur from time to time, and other factors specific to a borrower's circumstances, the level of non-performing assets will fluctuate.\nNon-performing assets, excluding FDIC-covered non-performing assets and other FDIC-assisted acquired assets, at December 31, 2015, were $44.0 million, an increase of $272,000 from $43.7 million at December 31, 2014. Non-performing assets, excluding FDIC-covered non-performing assets and other FDIC-assisted acquired assets, as a percentage of total assets were 1.07% at December 31, 2015, compared to 1.11% at December 31, 2014.\nCompared to December 31, 2014, non-performing loans increased $8.5 million to $16.6 million at December 31, 2015, and foreclosed assets decreased $8.1 million to $27.4 million at December 31, 2015. Non-performing commercial real estate loans comprised $13.5 million, or 81.4%, of the total of $16.6 million of non-performing loans at December 31, 2015. Non-performing one-to four-family residential loans comprised $1.4 million, or 8.2%, of the total non-performing loans at December 31, 2015. Non-performing consumer loans were $1.3 million, or 7.8%, of total non-performing loans at December 31, 2015. Non-performing commercial business loans were $288,000, or 1.7%, of total non-performing loans at December 31, 2015. Non-performing construction and land development loans were $139,000, or 0.8%, of total non-performing loans at December 31, 2015.\nNon-performing Loans. Activity in the non-performing loans category during the year ended December 31, 2015, was as follows:\nTable 101: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Beginning\nBalance,\nJanuary 1\n</td> <td>

potential problem loans during the current year and related to three relationships. The largest relationship in this category, which was transferred from potential problem loans to non-performing loans during the three months ended December 31, 2015, totaled $6.5 million, or 48.1% of the total category, and is collateralized by three operating long-term health care facilities in Missouri. This relationship with the Bank began in 2000 and has performed adequately until recently. A receiver was recently appointed to manage and stabilize the facilities. The second largest relationship in this category, which was also transferred from potential problem loans during the three months ended December 31, 2015, totaled $3.7 million, or 27.6%, of the total category, and is collateralized by property in the Branson, Mo., area, including a lakefront resort, marina and related amenities, condominiums and lots. This borrower has been in business for over 30 years and a bank customer since 1992. In 2015, the project experienced declining occupancy rates and entered bankruptcy in the latter part of 2015. Of the $1.5 million removed from non-performing commercial real estate loans during the year, $1.3 million was related to one loan, and was removed due to improvement in the credit and payment performance. The non-performing one- to four-family residential category included 27 loans, 16 of which were added during the year. The non-performing consumer category included 101 loans, 83 of which were added during the year.\nForeclosed Assets. Of the total $31.9 million of other real estate owned at December 31, 2015, $1.8 million represents the fair value of foreclosed assets covered by FDIC loss sharing agreements, $460,000 represents the fair value of foreclosed assets previously covered by FDIC loss sharing agreements, $995,000 represents foreclosed assets related to Valley Bank and not covered by loss sharing agreements, $25,000 represents other assets related to acquired loans, and $1.2 million represents properties which were not acquired through foreclosure. The foreclosed assets and other assets related to acquired loans and the properties not acquired through foreclosure are not included in the following table and discussion of foreclosed assets. Because sales of foreclosed properties exceeded additions, total foreclosed assets decreased. Activity in foreclosed assets during the year ended December 31, 2015, was as follows:\nTable 102: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Beginning\nBalance,\nJanuary 1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Arkansas and had a balance of $1.4 million, or 11.3% of the total category. Of the total dollar amount in the land development category of foreclosed assets, 35.4% and 36.2% was located in northwest Arkansas and in the Branson, Mo., area, respectively, including the $1.4 million property previously mentioned. Of the $5.0 million in proceeds from sales in the category, $2.9 million related to the sale of six properties, which included one property located in northwest Arkansas which was sold during the three months ended December 31, 2015, totaling $1.2 million. In addition, two properties totaling $1.6 million in the Branson, Mo., area were sold, two properties in northwest Arkansas totaling $1.3 million were sold and one property in southwest Missouri totaling $585,000 was sold. The subdivision construction category of foreclosed assets included 25 properties, the largest of which was located in the Springfield, Mo. metropolitan area and had a balance of $1.2 million, or 17.6% of the total category. Of the total dollar amount in the subdivision construction category of foreclosed assets, 32.2% and 17.6% is located in Branson, Mo. and Springfield, Mo., respectively. Of the $2.4 million in sales in this category, $2.3 million was from the sale of two properties. One subdivision property totaling $1.3 million in the Kansas City, Mo. metropolitan area was sold and one subdivision property in the St. Louis, Mo. metropolitan area totaling $931,000 was sold. The commercial real estate category of foreclosed assets included eight properties, three of which were related to the same borrower. The largest property in the commercial real estate category of foreclosed assets, which was located in southeast Missouri and was added during the three months ended March 31, 2015, totaled $2.0 million, or 56.0% of the total category. The other residential category of foreclosed assets included 11 properties, 10 of which were all part of the same condominium community, which was located in Branson, Mo. and had a balance of $1.8 million, or 83.7% of the total category. The one-to four-family residential category of foreclosed assets included seven properties, of which the largest relationship, with two properties in the southwest Missouri area, had a balance of $554,000, or 40.3% of the total category. Of the total dollar amount in the one-to- four-family category of foreclosed assets, 38.2% is located in Branson, Mo.\nPotential Problem Loans. Potential problem loans decreased $12.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, from $25.0 million at December 31, 2014 to $12.8 million at December 31, 2015. This decrease was due to $11.2 million in loans transferred to the non-performing category, $8.6 million in loans removed from potential problem loans due to improvements in the credits, $2.0 million in charge-offs, $157,000 in loans transferred to foreclosed assets, and $2.6 million in payments on potential problem loans, partially offset by the addition of $12.3 million of loans to potential problem loans. Potential problem loans are loans which management has identified through routine internal review procedures as having possible credit problems that may cause the borrowers difficulty in complying with current repayment terms. These loans are not reflected in non-performing assets, but are considered in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Activity in the potential problem loans category during the year ended December 31, 2015, was as follows:\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Beginning\nBalance,\nJanuary 1\n</td> <td>

were added during the current year. The largest relationship in this category, which was made up of five new loans added during the three months ended December 31, 2015, had a balance of $2.9 million, or 55.7% of the total category and is collateralized by various properties in the Branson, Mo., area., including commercial buildings, commercial land, residential lots and undeveloped land with clubhouse amenities and entertainment attractions. This relationship has been with the Bank for over 30 years. Of the $10.7 million of transfers to non-performing, $10.2 million were related to two relationships, which were discussed above in the non-performing loans section. All of the net charge-offs in the commercial real estate category related to these two relationships. The land development category of potential problem loans included one loan, which was added during a previous year and is collateralized by property in the Branson, Mo., area. The other residential category of potential problem loans included one loan which was added in a previous year, and is collateralized by properties located in the Branson, Mo., area. This loan was also to the same borrower that was referenced above in the land development category. The one- to four-family residential category of potential problem loans included 12 loans, two of which were added during the current year. The subdivision construction category of potential problem loans included three loans, two of which were added during the current year. Seven loans in this category were removed from potential problem loans during 2015, which included four loans to one borrower totaling $1.6 million. The loans were removed due to improvements in the credit and payment performance. The one-to four-family construction category of potential problem loans is zero at December 31, 2015, and three loans in this category, all of which were to the same borrower, were removed from potential problem loans during the year due to improvement in the borrower's financial performance. These loans were also to the same borrower that was referenced above in the loans which were removed from potential problem loans in the subdivision construction category.\nNon-Interest Income\nNon-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $13.6 million compared with $14.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease of $1.1 million, or 7.8%, was primarily the result of the following increases and decreases:\nInitial gain recognized on business acquisition: In 2014, the Company recognized a one-time gain of $10.8 million (pre-tax) on the FDIC-assisted acquisition of Valley Bank, which occurred on June 20, 2014.\nExcluding the gain referenced above, non-interest income increased $9.7 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily as a result of the following items:\nAmortization of income related to business acquisitions: The net amortization expense related to business acquisitions was $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $27.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2015, consisted of the following items: $18.0 million of amortization expense related to the changes in cash flows expected to be collected from the FDIC-covered loan portfolios and $1.6 million of amortization of the clawback liability. In addition, the Company collected amounts on various problem assets acquired from the FDIC totaling $892,000. Under the loss sharing agreements, 80% of these collected amounts must be remitted to the FDIC; therefore, the Company recorded a liability and related expense of $714,000. Partially offsetting the expense was income from the accretion of the discount related to the\nindemnification assets for the Sun Security Bank and InterBank acquisitions of $1.4 million. In addition, a charge-off on a loan pool which exceeded the remaining discount on the pool by $803,000 was recognized as a reduction to allowance for loan losses during the third quarter. The Bank expects to collect 80% of this amount as reimbursement from the FDIC, so income of $643,000 was recorded in non-interest income.\nService charges and ATM fees: Service charges and ATM fees increased $766,000 compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase in fee income from the additional accounts acquired in the Valley Bank transaction in June 2014.\nOther income: Other income increased $744,000 compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to a $1.1 million gain recognized when the Company redeemed the trust preferred securities previously issued by Great Southern Capital Trust III at a discount, as discussed in previous filings. This increase was offset by non-recurring debit card-related income of $1.0 million recognized during the 2014 period which was not repeated in the 2015 period. Other income increased $300,000 compared to the prior year due to a $300,000 gain recognized on the sale of a non-marketable investment.\nLate charges and fees on loans: Late charges and fees on loans increased $729,000 compared to the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to yield maintenance penalty payments received on 12 commercial loan prepayments, totaling $547,000 in 2015.\nNet realized gains on sales of available-for-sale securities: Gains on sales of available-for-sale securities decreased $2.1 million compared to the prior year. This was primarily due to the sale of securities in the prior year, which was not repeated in 2015. During 2014, the taxable municipal securities originally acquired in the Sun Security Bank acquisition were sold resulting in a gain of $1.2 million. All of the Company's Small Business Administration securities were sold in 2014, which produced a gain of $569,000. In addition, all of the mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations acquired in the Valley Bank acquisition were sold in 2014, and several additional securities were sold later in 2014, producing a gain of $227,000, and one municipal bond was sold at a gain of $95,000.\nNon-Interest Expense\nTotal non-interest expense decreased $6.5 million, or 5.4%, from $120.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, to $114.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company's efficiency ratio for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 62.85%, improving from 66.30% in 2014. The 2015 ratio was positively affected by the decrease in non-interest expense and the increase in net interest income, partially offset by a decrease in non-interest income. The Company's ratio of non-interest expense to average assets decreased from 3.16% for the year ended December 31, 2014, to 2.81% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in the current year ratio was primarily due to both the increase in average assets and the decrease in non-interest expense in 2015 compared to 2014. Average assets for the year ended December 31, 2015, increased $242.9 million, or 6.4%, from the year ended December 31, 2014. The following were key items related to the increase in non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014:\nOther Operating Expenses: Other operating expenses decreased $7.3 million, to $8.5 million, in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year primarily due to $7.4 million in prepayment penalties paid in 2014 as the Company elected to repay $130 million of its FHLB advances and structured repo borrowings prior to their maturity, which was not repeated in 2015.\nExpense on foreclosed assets: Expense on foreclosed assets decreased $3.1 million compared to the prior year primarily due to valuation write-downs of foreclosed assets during 2014 totaling $2.0 million. In addition, total foreclosed assets decreased from the prior year, further reducing the expenses.\nLegal, audit and other professional fees: Legal, audit and other professional fees decreased $1.2 million when compared to the prior year, primarily due to additional expenses in the prior year related to the Valley Bank acquisition, significant collection costs of a few large loans and foreclosed assets, as well as the reduction of the total amount of foreclosed assets in the current year compared to the prior year.\nPartially offsetting the decrease in non-interest expense was an increase in the following items:\nExpenses related to operations of new banking centers in 2015: The Company incurred approximately $245,000 and $144,000 of additional non-interest expenses during the year ended December 31, 2015, in connection with the operations of new banking centers in Overland Park, Kansas and Columbia, Missouri, respectively. The majority of these expenses related to salary and benefits and occupancy expenses.\nSalaries and employee benefits: Salaries and employee benefits increased $2.7 million over the prior year, primarily due to increased staffing due to growth in lending and other operational areas, as well as approximately $330,000 in retention payments and other acquisition-related salaries and benefits related to the Fifth Third Bank branch acquisition. In addition, the Company opened banking\ncenters in 2015 in Overland Park, Kansas and Columbia, Missouri, and operated the acquired Valley Bank for a full year in 2015 versus one-half year of operations in 2014.\nNet occupancy expense: Net occupancy expense increased $2.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014. In September 2015, the Company announced plans to consolidate operations of 16 banking centers into other nearby Great Southern banking center locations. The Company evaluated the carrying value of the affected premises (totaling approximately $7.5 million) to determine if any impairment of the value of these premises is warranted and has recorded a valuation allowance of $1.2 million related to certain affected premises, furniture, fixtures and equipment and leases in 2015. Occupancy expense also increased in 2015 as a result of the Valley Bank acquisition which occurred in June 2014, and due to the opening of the two branches in Overland Park and Columbia noted above.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nIn 2014, the Company elected to early-adopt FASB ASU No. 2014-01, which amends FASB ASC Topic 323, Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures. This Update impacted the Company's accounting for investments in flow-through limited liability entities which manage or invest in affordable housing projects that qualify for the low-income housing tax credit. The amendments in the Update permitted reporting entities to make an accounting policy election to account for their investments in qualified affordable housing projects using the proportional amortization method if certain conditions are met. Under the proportional amortization method, an entity amortizes the initial cost of the investment in proportion to the tax credits and other tax benefits received and recognizes the net investment performance in the income statement as a component of income tax expense (benefit). The Company has significant investments in such qualified affordable housing projects that meet the required conditions. The Company's adoption of this Update did not materially affect the Company's financial position or results of operations. There was no change in Net Income for the periods covered in this document and there was no cumulative effect adjustment to Retained Earnings.\nProvision for income taxes as a percentage of pre-tax income was 25.1% and 24.0% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which was lower than the statutory federal tax rate of 35%, due primarily to the effects of the tax credits utilized and to tax-exempt investments and tax-exempt loans which reduced the Company's effective tax rate. In future periods, the Company expects its effective tax rate typically will be 24-26% of pre-tax net income, assuming it continues to maintain or increase its use of investment tax credits. The Company's effective tax rate may fluctuate as it is impacted by the level and timing of the Company's utilization of tax credits and the level of tax-exempt investments and loans and the overall level of pretax income. At this time, the Company expects to continue to utilize a significant amount of tax credits in 2016.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity is a measure of the Company's ability to generate sufficient cash to meet present and future financial obligations in a timely manner through either the sale or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds through liability management. These obligations include the credit needs of customers, funding deposit withdrawals and the day-to-day operations of the Company. Liquid assets include cash, interest-bearing deposits with financial institutions and certain investment securities and loans. As a result of the Company's management of the ability to generate liquidity primarily through liability funding, management believes that the Company maintains overall liquidity sufficient to satisfy its depositors' requirements and meet its customers' credit needs. At December 31, 2016, the Company had commitments of approximately $142.0 million to fund loan originations, $781.8 million of unused lines of credit and unadvanced loans, and $26.4 million of outstanding letters of credit.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's fixed and determinable contractual obligations by payment date as of December 31, 2016. Additional information regarding these contractual obligations is discussed further in Notes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17 and 20 of the accompanying audited financial statements, which are included in Item 8 of this Report.\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Payments Due In:\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> One Year or\nLess\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Over One to\nFive\nYears\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Over Five\nYears\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (In Thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deposits without a stated maturity\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,192,504\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,192,504\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Time and brokered certificates of deposit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,036,958\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 443,944\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,824\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,484,726\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Federal Home Loan Bank advances\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 30,843\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 31,452\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Short-term borrowings\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 286,023\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 286,023\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subordinated debentures\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 25,774\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 25,774\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subordinated notes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 73,537\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 73,537\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,458\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,349\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dividends declared but not paid\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,073\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,073\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,550,220\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 445,511\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 103,707\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,099,438\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's primary sources of funds are customer deposits, FHLBank advances, other borrowings, loan repayments, unpledged securities, proceeds from sales of loans and available-for-sale securities and funds provided from operations. The Company utilizes particular sources of funds based on the comparative costs and availability at the time. The Company has from time to time chosen not to pay rates on deposits as high as the rates paid by certain of its competitors and, when believed to be appropriate, supplements deposits with less expensive alternative sources of funds.\nAt December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had these available secured lines and on-balance sheet liquidity:\nTable 105: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Federal Home Loan Bank line\n</td> <td> $551.0 million\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $505.5 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Federal Reserve Bank line\n</td> <td> 602.0 million\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 633.7 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest-Bearing and Non-Interest-Bearing\nDeposits\n</td> <td> 279.8 million\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 199.2 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unpledged Securities\n</td> <td> 50.7 million\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 59.8 million\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nStatements of Cash Flows. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company had positive cash flows from operating activities. The Company experienced negative cash flows from investing activities during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, and positive cash flows from investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2014. The Company experienced positive cash flows from financing activities during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, and negative cash flows from financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nCash flows from operating activities for the periods covered by the Statements of Cash Flows have been primarily related to changes in accrued and deferred assets, credits and other liabilities, the provision for loan losses, realized gains on the sale of investment securities and loans, depreciation and amortization, gains on the purchase of additional business units and the amortization of deferred loan origination fees and discounts (premiums) on loans and investments, all of which are non-cash or non-operating adjustments to operating cash flows. Net income adjusted for non-cash and non-operating items and the origination and sale of loans held-for-sale were the primary sources of cash flows from operating activities. Operating activities provided cash flows of $80.1 million, $71.4 million and $67.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, investing activities used cash of $198.1 million and $196.2 million, respectively, primarily due to the net increases and purchases of loans, partially offset by the net repayment or sales of investment securities. During the year ended December 31, 2014, investing activities provided cash of $35.9 million, primarily due to the cash received from the FDIC-assisted acquisitions and the net repayment or sales of investment securities, partially offset by increases in loans.\nChanges in cash flows from financing activities during the periods covered by the Statements of Cash Flows are primarily due to changes in deposits after interest credited, changes in FHLBank advances, changes in short-term borrowings and structured repurchase\nagreements, dividend payments to stockholders, issuance of subordinated notes (2016) and redemption of preferred stock (2015). Financing activities provided cash flows of $198.7 million and $105.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily due to increases in customer deposit balances, partially offset by net increases or decreases in various borrowings, dividend payments to stockholders, issuance of subordinated notes and redemption of preferred stock. Financing activities used cash flows of $112.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to reduction of customer deposit balances, net increases or decreases in various borrowings and dividend payments to stockholders.\nCapital Resources\nManagement continuously reviews the capital position of the Company and the Bank to ensure compliance with minimum regulatory requirements, as well as to explore ways to increase capital either by retained earnings or other means.\nAs of December 31, 2016, total stockholders' equity and common stockholders' equity were $429.8 million, or 9.4% of total assets, equivalent to a book value of $30.77 per common share. As of December 31, 2015, total stockholders' equity and common stockholders' equity were $398.2 million, or 9.7% of total assets, equivalent to a book value of $28.67 per common share. At December 31, 2016, the Company's tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 9.2% as compared to 9.6% at December 31, 2015.\nBanks are required to maintain minimum risk-based capital ratios. These ratios compare capital, as defined by the risk-based regulations, to assets adjusted for their relative risk as defined by the regulations. Under current guidelines, which became effective January 1, 2015, banks must have a minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.50%, a minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.00%, a minimum total risk-based capital ratio of 8.00%, and a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.00%. To be considered \"well capitalized,\" banks must have a minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.50%, a minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.00%, a minimum total risk-based capital ratio of 10.00%, and a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5.00%. On December 31, 2016, the Bank's common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.8%, its Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.8%, its total capital ratio was 12.7% and its Tier 1 leverage ratio was 10.8%. As a result, as of December 31, 2016, the Bank was well capitalized, with capital ratios in excess of those required to qualify as such. On December 31, 2015, the Bank's common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.0%, its Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.0%, its total capital ratio was 12.1% and its Tier 1 leverage ratio was 9.8%. As a result, as of December 31, 2015, the Bank was well capitalized, with capital ratios in excess of those required to qualify as such.\nThe FRB has established capital regulations for bank holding companies that generally parallel the capital regulations for banks. On December 31, 2016, the Company's common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 10.2%, its Tier 1 capital ratio was 10.8%, its total capital ratio was 13.6% and its Tier 1 leverage ratio was 9.9%. To be considered well capitalized, a bank holding company must have a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.00% and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.00%. As of December 31, 2016, the Company was considered well capitalized, with capital ratios in excess of those required to qualify as such. On December 31, 2015, the Company's common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 10.8%, its Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.5%, its total capital ratio was 12.6% and its Tier 1 leverage ratio was 10.2%. To be considered well capitalized, a bank holding company must have a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.00% and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.00%. As of December 31, 2015, the Company was considered well capitalized, with capital ratios in excess of those required to qualify as such.\nIn addition to the minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and total risk-based capital ratio, the Company and the Bank will have to maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional common equity Tier 1 capital greater than 2.5% of risk-weighted assets above the required minimum levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, repurchasing shares, and paying discretionary bonuses. The new capital conservation buffer requirement began phasing in beginning on January 1, 2016 when a buffer greater than 0.625% of risk-weighted assets was required, which amount will increase an equal amount each year until the buffer requirement of greater than 2.5% of risk-weighted assets is fully implemented on January 1, 2019.\nOn August 18, 2011, the Company entered into a Small Business Lending Fund-Securities Purchase Agreement (\"Purchase Agreement\") with the Secretary of the Treasury, pursuant to which the Company sold 57,943 shares of the Company's Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A (the \"SBLF Preferred Stock\") to the Secretary of the Treasury for a purchase price of $57.9 million. The SBLF Preferred Stock was issued pursuant to Treasury's SBLF program, a $30 billion fund established under the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 that was created to encourage lending to small businesses by providing Tier 1 capital to qualified community banks and holding companies with assets of less than $10 billion. As required by the SBLF Purchase Agreement, the proceeds from the sale of the SBLF Preferred Stock were used in connection with the redemption of all 58,000 shares of the Company's preferred stock, issued to Treasury in December 2008 pursuant to Treasury's TARP Capital Purchase Program (the \"CPP\"). The shares of CPP Preferred Stock were redeemed at their liquidation amount of $1,000 per share plus the accrued but unpaid dividends to the redemption date.\nThe SBLF Preferred Stock qualified as Tier 1 capital. The holders of SBLF Preferred Stock were entitled to receive noncumulative dividends, payable quarterly, on each January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1. The dividend rate, as a percentage of the liquidation\namount, could fluctuate between one percent (1%) and five percent (5%) per annum on a quarterly basis during the first 10 quarters during which the SBLF Preferred Stock was outstanding, based upon changes in the level of \"Qualified Small Business Lending\" or \"QSBL\" (as defined in the SBLF Purchase Agreement) by the Bank over the adjusted baseline level calculated under the terms of the SBLF Preferred Stock $(249.7 million). Based upon the increase in the Bank's level of QSBL over the adjusted baseline level, the dividend rate had been 1.0%. For the tenth calendar quarter through four and one-half years after issuance, the dividend rate was fixed at one percent (1%) based upon the level of qualifying loans. After four and one half years from issuance, the dividend rate would have increased to 9% (including a quarterly lending incentive fee of 0.5%).\nOn December 15, 2015, the Company (with the approval of its federal banking regulator) redeemed all 57,943 shares of the SBLF Preferred Stock at their liquidation amount of $1,000 per share plus accrued but unpaid dividends to the redemption date. The redemption of the SBLF Preferred Stock was completed using internally available funds.\nDividends. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company declared common stock cash dividends of $0.88 per share (27.4% of net income per common share) and paid common stock cash dividends of $0.88 per share. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company declared common stock cash dividends of $0.86 per share (26.2% of net income per common share) and paid common stock cash dividends of $0.84 per share. The Board of Directors meets regularly to consider the level and the timing of dividend payments. The $0.22 per share dividend declared but unpaid as of December 31, 2016, was paid to stockholders on January 13, 2017. In addition, the Company paid preferred dividends as described below in years prior to 2016.\nWhile the SBLF Preferred Stock was outstanding, the terms of the SBLF Preferred Stock limited the ability of the Company to pay dividends and repurchase shares of common stock. Under the terms of the SBLF Preferred Stock, no repurchases could be effected, and no dividends could be declared or paid on preferred shares ranking pari passu with the SBLF Preferred Stock, junior preferred shares, or other junior securities (including the common stock) during the current quarter and for the next three quarters following the failure to declare and pay dividends on the SBLF Preferred Stock, except that, in any such quarter in which the dividend is paid, dividend payments on shares ranking pari passu may be paid to the extent necessary to avoid any resulting material covenant breach.\nUnder the terms of the SBLF Preferred Stock, the Company could only declare and pay a dividend on the common stock or other stock junior to the SBLF Preferred Stock, or repurchase shares of any such class or series of stock, if, after payment of such dividend, or after giving effect to such repurchase, (i) the dollar amount of the Company's Tier 1 Capital would be at least equal to the \"Tier 1 Dividend Threshold\" and (ii) full dividends on all outstanding shares of SBLF Preferred Stock for the most recently completed dividend period have been or are contemporaneously declared and paid. We satisfied this condition through the redemption date of the SBLF Preferred Stock.\nCommon Stock Repurchases and Issuances. The Company has been in various buy-back programs since May 1990. Our ability to repurchase common stock was limited, but allowed, under the terms of the SBLF preferred stock as noted above, under \"-Dividends\" and was previously generally precluded due to our participation in the CPP from December 2008 through August 2011. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company issued 80,454 shares of stock at an average price of $26.47 per share and 133,126 shares of stock at an average price of $25.26 per share, respectively, to cover stock option exercises.\nManagement has historically utilized stock buy-back programs from time to time as long as management believed that repurchasing the stock would contribute to the overall growth of shareholder value. The number of shares of stock that will be repurchased at any particular time and the prices that will be paid are subject to many factors, several of which are outside of the control of the Company. The primary factors, however, are the number of shares available in the market from sellers at any given time, the price of the stock within the market as determined by the market and the projected impact on the Company's earnings per share and capital.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION\nForward-looking Statements\nWhen used in this Annual Report and in other documents filed or furnished by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), in the Company's press releases or other public or stockholder communications, and in oral statements made with the approval of an authorized executive officer, the words or phrases \"will likely result,\" \"are expected to,\" \"will continue,\" \"is anticipated,\" \"estimate,\" \"project,\" \"intends\" or similar expressions are intended to identify \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including, among other things, (i) non-interest expense reductions from Great Southern's banking center consolidations might be less than anticipated and the costs of the consolidation and impairment of the value of the affected premises might be greater than expected; (ii) expected revenues, cost savings, earnings accretion, synergies and other benefits from the Fifth Third Bank branch acquisition and the Company's other merger and acquisition activities might not be realized within the anticipated time frames or at all, and costs or difficulties relating to integration matters, including but not limited to customer and employee retention, might be greater than expected; (iii) changes in economic conditions, either nationally or in the Company's market areas; (iv) fluctuations in interest rates; (v) the risks of lending and investing activities, including changes in the level and direction of loan delinquencies and write-offs and changes in estimates of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses; (vi) the possibility of other-than-temporary impairments of securities held in the Company's securities portfolio; (vii) the Company's ability to access cost-effective funding; (viii) fluctuations in real estate values and both residential and commercial real estate market conditions; (ix) demand for loans and deposits in the Company's market areas; (x) the ability to adapt successfully to technological changes to meet customers' needs and developments in the marketplace; (xi) the possibility that security measures implemented might not be sufficient to mitigate the risk of a cyber attack or cyber theft, and that such security measures might not protect against systems failures or interruptions; (xii) legislative or regulatory changes that adversely affect the Company's business, including, without limitation, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and its implementing regulations, and the overdraft protection regulations and customers' responses thereto; (xiii) changes in accounting principles, policies or guidelines; (xiv) monetary and fiscal policies of the Federal Reserve Board and the U.S. Government and other governmental initiatives affecting the financial services industry; (xv) results of examinations of the Company and the Bank by their regulators, including the possibility that the regulators may, among other things, require the Company to increase its allowance for loan losses or to write-down assets; (xvi) costs and effects of litigation, including settlements and judgments; and (xvii) competition. The Company wishes to advise readers that the factors listed above and other risks described from time to time in documents filed or furnished by the Company with the SEC could affect the Company's financial performance and could cause the Company's actual results for future periods to differ materially from any opinions or statements expressed with respect to future periods in any current statements.\nThe Company does not undertake-and specifically declines any obligation- to publicly release the result of any revisions which may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.\nCritical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates\nThe accounting and reporting policies of the Company conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and general practices within the financial services industry. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nAllowance for Loan Losses and Valuation of Foreclosed Assets\nThe Company believes that the determination of the allowance for loan losses involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity than its other significant accounting policies. The allowance for loan losses is calculated with the objective of maintaining an allowance level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated loan losses. Management's determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio and other relevant factors. However, this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates of, among other things, expected default probabilities, loss once loans default, expected commitment usage, the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, value of collateral, estimated losses, and general amounts for historical loss experience.\nThe process also considers economic conditions, uncertainties in estimating losses and inherent risks in the loan portfolio. All of these factors may be susceptible to significant change. To the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates, additional provisions for loan losses may be required which would adversely impact earnings in future periods. In addition, the Bank's regulators could require additional provisions for loan losses as part of their examination process.\nAdditional discussion of the allowance for loan losses is included in \"Item 1. Business - Allowances for Losses on Loans and Foreclosed Assets.\" Inherent in this process is the evaluation of individual significant credit relationships. From time to time certain credit relationships may deteriorate due to payment performance, cash flow of the borrower, value of collateral, or other factors. In these instances, management may revise its loss estimates and assumptions for these specific credits due to changing circumstances. In some cases, additional losses may be realized; in other instances, the factors that led to the deterioration may improve or the credit may be refinanced elsewhere and allocated allowances may be released from the particular credit. In the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company began using a three-year average of historical losses for the general component of the allowance for loan loss calculation. The Company had previously used a five-year average. The Company believes that the three-year average provides a better representation of the current risks in the loan portfolio. This change was made after consultation with our regulators and third-party consultants, as well as a review of the practices used by the Company's peers. No other significant changes were made to management's overall methodology for evaluating the allowance for loan losses during the periods presented in the financial statements of this report.\nIn addition, the Company considers that the determination of the valuations of foreclosed assets held for sale involves a high degree of judgment and complexity. The carrying value of foreclosed assets reflects management's best estimate of the amount to be realized from the sales of the assets. While the estimate is generally based on a valuation by an independent appraiser or recent sales of similar properties, the amount that the Company realizes from the sales of the assets could differ materially from the carrying value reflected in the financial statements, resulting in losses that could adversely impact earnings in future periods.\nCarrying Value of Loans Acquired in FDIC-assisted Transactions and Indemnification Asset\nThe Company considers that the determination of the carrying value of loans acquired in the FDIC-assisted transactions and the carrying value of the related FDIC indemnification asset involves a high degree of judgment and complexity. The carrying value of the acquired loans and the FDIC indemnification asset reflect management's best ongoing estimates of the amounts to be realized on each of these assets. The Company determined initial fair value accounting estimates of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities in accordance with FASB ASC 805, Business Combinations. However, the amount that the Company realizes on these assets could differ materially from the carrying value reflected in its financial statements, based upon the timing of collections on the acquired loans in future periods. Because of the loss sharing agreements with the FDIC on certain of these assets, the Company should not incur any significant losses related to these assets. To the extent the actual values realized for the acquired loans are different from the estimates, the indemnification asset will generally be impacted in an offsetting manner due to the loss sharing support from the FDIC. Subsequent to the initial valuation, the Company continues to monitor identified loan pools and related loss sharing assets for changes in estimated cash flows projected for the loan pools, anticipated credit losses and changes in the accretable yield. Analysis of these variables requires significant estimates and a high degree of judgment. See Note 4 of the accompanying audited financial statements for additional information regarding the TeamBank, Vantus Bank, Sun Security Bank, InterBank and Valley Bank FDIC-assisted transactions.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are subject to an impairment test at least annually and more frequently if circumstances indicate their value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment using a process that estimates the fair value of each of the Company's reporting units compared with its carrying value. The Company defines reporting units as a level below each of its operating segments for which there is discrete financial information that is regularly reviewed. As of December 31, 2016, the Company has one reporting unit to which goodwill has been allocated - the Bank. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, then no impairment is recorded. If the carrying value amount exceeds the fair value of a reporting unit,\nfurther testing is completed comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill to its carrying value to measure the amount of impairment. Intangible assets that are not amortized will be tested for impairment at least annually by comparing the fair values of those assets to their carrying values. At December 31, 2016, goodwill consisted of $5.4 million at the Bank reporting unit, which included goodwill of $4.2 million that was recorded during 2016 related to the acquisition of 12 branches from Fifth Third Bank. Other identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization are amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of seven years. At December 31, 2016, the amortizable intangible assets consisted of core deposit intangibles of $7.1 million, including $3.8 million related to the Fifth Third Bank transaction in January 2016, $1.8 million related to the Valley Bank transaction in June 2014 and $519,000 related to the Boulevard Bank transaction in March 2014. These amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment if circumstances indicate their value may not be recoverable based on a comparison of fair value. See Note 1 of the accompanying audited financial statements for additional information.\nFor purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, the Company used a market approach to value its reporting unit. The market approach applies a market multiple, based on observed purchase transactions for each reporting unit, to the metrics appropriate for the valuation of the operating unit. Significant judgment is applied when goodwill is assessed for impairment. This judgment may include developing cash flow projections, selecting appropriate discount rates, identifying relevant market comparables and incorporating general economic and market conditions.\nBased on the Company's goodwill impairment testing, management does not believe any of its goodwill or other intangible assets are impaired as of December 31, 2016. While the Company believes no impairment existed at December 31, 2016, different conditions or assumptions used to measure fair value of the reporting unit, or changes in cash flows or profitability, if significantly negative or unfavorable, could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of the Company's impairment evaluation in the future.\nCurrent Economic Conditions\nChanges in economic conditions could cause the values of assets and liabilities recorded in the financial statements to change rapidly, resulting in material future adjustments in asset values, the allowance for loan losses, or capital that could negatively impact the Company's ability to meet regulatory capital requirements and maintain sufficient liquidity.\nFollowing the bursting of the housing bubble in mid-2007 and the subsequent housing market correction and subprime mortgage crisis, the United States entered into a significant prolonged economic downturn. Unemployment rose from 4.7% in November 2007 to peak at 10.0% in October 2009. The elevated unemployment levels negatively impacted consumer confidence, which had a detrimental impact on industry-wide performance nationally as well as in the Company's Midwest market area. Economic conditions have improved considerably over the past few years as indicated by increasing consumer confidence levels, increased economic activity and low unemployment levels.\nThe national unemployment rate decreased from 5.0% as of December 2015 to 4.7% as of December 2016. The labor force participation rate, which is the share of working-age Americans who are either employed or are actively looking for a job, remained level at 63%. The economy added 156,000 jobs in December 2016, with employment gains predominantly occurring in health care and social assistance. Job growth totaled 2.2 million in 2016, which was less than the 2.7 million increase in 2015. As of December 31, 2016, the unemployment rate for the Midwest, where most of the Company's business is conducted, was at 4.1% significantly lower than the 4.6% U.S. rate. Unemployment rates at December 31, 2016, were: Missouri at 4.4%, Arkansas at 3.9%, Kansas at 4.2%, Iowa at 3.6%, Nebraska at 3.4%, Minnesota at 3.9%, Oklahoma at 5.0% and Texas at 4.6%. A few state unemployment rates increased compared to December 2015 levels; however, Oklahoma was the only state with an unemployment rate greater than the national average. Oklahoma was affected by job losses in the manufacturing, mining and logging industries. Of the metropolitan areas in which Great Southern Bank does business, the Tulsa market area had the highest unemployment level at December 31, 2016 at 5.0%. The unemployment rate at 3.9 % for the Springfield market area was below the national average reported as of December 31, 2016. Metropolitan areas in Arkansas, Iowa, Nebraska and Minnesota boasted unemployment levels among the lowest in the nation.\nSales of newly built, single-family homes were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 536,000 units in December 2016, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the U.S. Census Bureau. This represents a 10.4% decrease since November 2016 and a 0.4% drop from the December 2015 rate of 538,000. The median sales price of new houses sold in December 2016 was $322,500, with an average sales price of $384,000. The seasonally adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of December 2016 was 259,000, which represented a supply of 5.8 months at the current sales rate. Sales of existing single-family homes closed out 2016 as the best year in a decade, even as sales declined in December as the result of ongoing affordability tensions and historically low supply levels. In December, existing sales decreased 2.8% resulting in sales only 0.7% higher than a year ago. First-time buyers made up 32% of those transactions, the biggest share in four years, easing concerns that a shortage of affordable houses has been pushing entry-level buyers out of the market. The median existing-home price for all housing types in December was $232,200, up 4% from December 2015 ($223,200). Total housing inventory at the end of December dropped 10.8% to 1.65 million existing homes available for sale, which is the lowest level since National Association of Realtors began tracking the supply of all housing types in 1999. Unsold inventory is at a 3.6 month supply at the current sales pace.\nDistressed sales, which include foreclosures and short sales, rose to 7% in December, down from 8% a year ago. Foreclosures sold for an average discount of 20% below market value, while short sales were discounted 10%.\nThe performance of commercial real estate markets has improved throughout the Company's market areas as shown by increased real estate sales and financing activity. According to real estate services firm CoStar Group, retail, office and industrial types of commercial real estate properties continue to improve or remain stable in occupancy, absorption and rental income, both nationally and in our market areas.\nWhile current economic indicators show improvement nationally in employment, housing starts and prices, commercial real estate occupancy, absorption and rental income, our management will continue to closely monitor regional, national and global economic conditions, as these could significantly impact our market areas.\nLoss Sharing Agreements\nOn April 26, 2016, Great Southern Bank executed an agreement with the FDIC to terminate the loss sharing agreements for Team Bank, Vantus Bank and Sun Security Bank, effective immediately. The agreement required the FDIC to pay $4.4 million to settle all outstanding items related to the terminated loss sharing agreements. As a result of entering into the agreement, assets that were covered by the terminated loss sharing agreements, including covered loans in the amount of $61.5 million and covered other real estate owned in the amount of $468,000 as of March 31, 2016, were reclassified as non-covered assets effective April 26, 2016. In anticipation of terminating the loss sharing agreements, an impairment of the related indemnification assets was recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2016 in the amount of $584,000. On the date of the termination, the indemnification asset balances (and certain other receivables from the FDIC) related to Team Bank, Vantus Bank and Sun Security Bank, which totaled $4.4 million at March 31, 2016, became $0 as a result of the receipt of funds from the FDIC as outlined in the termination agreement. There will be no future effects on non-interest income (expense) related to adjustments or amortization of the indemnification assets for Team Bank, Vantus Bank or Sun Security Bank; however, adjustments and amortization related to the InterBank indemnification asset and loss sharing agreement will continue. The remaining accretable yield adjustments that affect interest income are not changed by this transaction and continue to be recognized for all FDIC-assisted transactions in the same manner as they have been previously.\nThe termination of the loss sharing agreements for the TeamBank, Vantus Bank and Sun Security Bank transactions has had no impact on the yields for the loans that were previously covered under these agreements. All future recoveries, gains, losses and expenses related to these previously covered assets will now be recognized entirely by Great Southern Bank since the FDIC will no longer be sharing in such gains or losses. Accordingly, the Company's future earnings will be positively impacted to the extent the Company recognizes gains on any sales or recoveries in excess of the carrying value of such assets. Similarly, the Company's future earnings will be negatively impacted to the extent the Company recognizes expenses, losses or charge-offs related to such assets.\nGeneral\nThe profitability of the Company and, more specifically, the profitability of its primary subsidiary, the Bank, depends primarily on its net interest income, as well as provisions for loan losses and the level of non-interest income and non-interest expense. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income the Bank earns on its loans and investment portfolio, and the interest it pays on interest-bearing liabilities, which consists mainly of interest paid on deposits and borrowings. Net interest income is affected by the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on these balances. When interest-earning assets approximate or exceed interest-bearing liabilities, any positive interest rate spread will generate net interest income.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2016, Great Southern's total assets increased $446.5 million, or 10.9%, from $4.10 billion at December 31, 2015, to $4.55 billion at December 31, 2016. Full details of the current year changes in total assets are provided in the \"Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015\" section.\nLoans. In the year ended December 31, 2016, Great Southern's net loans increased $419.4 million, or 12.6%, from $3.34 billion at December 31, 2015, to $3.76 billion at December 31, 2016. Partially offsetting the increase in loans was a decrease of $79.7 million in the FDIC-acquired loan portfolios. Excluding previously acquired covered and non-covered loans and mortgage loans held for sale, but including the loans acquired from Fifth Third Bank, total loans increased $499.7 million from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016. The increases occurred across several loans types, primarily in other residential (multi-family) loans, commercial real estate loans, one- to four-family residential loans, consumer loans and home equity lines of credit. The increase was primarily due to loan growth in our existing banking center network, and also due to the loans acquired from Fifth Third Bank during the year. As loan demand is affected by a variety of factors, including general economic conditions, and because of the competition we face and our focus on pricing discipline and credit quality, we cannot be assured that our loan growth will match or exceed the level of increases achieved in 2016 or prior years. The Company's strategy continues to be focused on maintaining credit risk and interest rate risk at appropriate levels.\nLoan growth has occurred in most loan types and has come from most of Great Southern's primary lending locations, including Springfield, St. Louis, Kansas City, Des Moines, and Minneapolis, as well as the loan production offices in Dallas and Tulsa. Net loan balances have increased primarily in the areas of commercial construction, consumer, and commercial real estate (including multi-family). Generally, the Company considers these types of loans to involve a higher degree of risk compared to some other types of loans, such as first mortgage loans on one- to four-family, owner-occupied residential properties, and has established certain minimum underwriting standards to help assure portfolio quality. For commercial real estate and construction loans, these standards and procedures include, but are not limited to, an analysis of the borrower's financial condition, collateral, repayment ability, verification of liquid assets and credit history as required by loan type. In addition, geographic diversity of collateral, lower loan-to-value ratios and limitations on speculative construction projects help to mitigate overall risk in these loans. It has been, and continues to be, Great Southern's practice to verify information from potential borrowers regarding assets, income or payment ability and credit ratings as applicable and as required by the authority approving the loan. Underwriting standards also include loan-to-value ratios which vary depending on collateral type, debt service coverage ratios or debt payment to income ratios, where applicable, credit histories, use of guaranties and other recommended terms relating to equity requirements, amortization, and maturity. Great Southern's loan committee reviews and approves all new loan originations in excess of lender approval authorities. Consumer loans are primarily secured by new and used motor vehicles and these loans are also subject to certain minimum underwriting standards to assure portfolio quality. Great Southern's consumer underwriting and pricing standards have been fairly consistent over the past several years. The underwriting standards employed by Great Southern for consumer loans include a determination of the applicant's payment history on other debts, credit scores, employment history and an assessment of ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. Although creditworthiness of the applicant is of primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral, if any, in relation to the proposed loan amount.\nOf the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2016 and 2015, 75.9% and 73.5%, respectively, was secured by real estate, as this is the Bank's primary focus in its lending efforts. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, commercial real estate and commercial construction loans were 42.1% and 42.8% of the Bank's total loan portfolio (excluding loans acquired through FDIC-assisted transactions), respectively. Commercial real estate and commercial construction loans generally afford the Bank an opportunity to increase the yield on, and the proportion of interest rate sensitive loans in, its portfolio. They do, however, present somewhat greater risk to the Bank because they may be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the economy generally. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, loans made in the Springfield, Mo. metropolitan statistical area (Springfield MSA) were 12% and 15% of the Bank's total loan portfolio (excluding loans acquired through FDIC-assisted transactions), respectively. The Company's headquarters are located in Springfield and we have operated in this market since 1923. Because of our large presence and experience in the Springfield MSA, many lending opportunities exist. However, if the economic conditions of the Springfield MSA were worse than those of other market areas in which we operate or the national economy overall, the performance of these loans could decline comparatively. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, loans made in the St. Louis, Mo. metropolitan statistical area (St. Louis MSA) were 19% and 18% of the Bank's total loan portfolio (excluding loans acquired through FDIC-assisted transactions, but including loans acquired from Fifth Third Bank), respectively. The Company's expansion into the St. Louis MSA beginning in May 2009 has provided an opportunity to not only expand its markets and provide diversification from the Springfield MSA, but also has provided access to a larger economy with increased lending opportunities despite higher levels of competition. Loans made in the St. Louis MSA are primarily commercial real estate, commercial business and multi-family residential loans which are less likely to be impacted by the higher levels of unemployment rates, as mentioned above under \"Current Economic Conditions,\" than if the focus were on one- to four-family residential and consumer loans. For further discussions of the Bank's loan portfolio, and specifically, commercial real estate and commercial construction loans, see \"Item 1. Business - Lending Activities.\"\nThe percentage of fixed-rate loans in our loan portfolio has increased from 46% as of December 31, 2010 to 57% as of December 31, 2016 due to customer preference for fixed rate loans during this period of low interest rates. The majority of the increase in fixed rate loans was in commercial construction and consumer loans, both of which typically have loans with short durations. Of the total amount of fixed rate loans in our portfolio as of December 31, 2016, approximately 77% mature within one to five years and therefore are not considered to create significant long-term interest rate risk for the Company. Fixed rate loans make up only a portion of our balance sheet and our overall interest rate risk strategy. As of December 31, 2016, our interest rate risk models indicated a one-year interest rate earnings sensitivity position that is fairly neutral. For further discussion of our interest rate sensitivity gap and the processes used to manage our exposure to interest rate risk, see \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - How We Measure the Risks to Us Associated with Interest Rate Changes.\" For discussion of the risk factors associated with interest rate changes, see \"Risk Factors - We may be adversely affected by interest rate changes.\"\nWhile our policy allows us to lend up to 95% of the appraised value on one-to four-family residential properties, originations of loans with loan-to-value ratios at that level are minimal. Private mortgage insurance is typically required for loan amounts above the 80% level. Few exceptions occur and would be based on analyses which determined minimal transactional risk to be involved. We consider these lending practices to be consistent with or more conservative than what we believe to be the norm for banks our size. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, an estimated 0.2% and 0.2%, respectively, of total owner occupied one- to four-family\nresidential loans had loan-to-value ratios above 100% at origination. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, an estimated 1.3% and 2.1%, respectively, of total non-owner occupied one- to four-family residential loans had loan-to-value ratios above 100% at origination.\nAt December 31, 2016, troubled debt restructurings totaled $21.1 million, or 0.6% of total loans, down $23.9 million from $45.0 million, or 1.3% of total loans, at December 31, 2015. Concessions granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties may include a reduction in the interest rate on the loan, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance or other actions intended to maximize collection. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, no loans were restructured into multiple new loans. For further information on troubled debt restructurings, see Note 3 of the accompanying audited financial statements, which are included in Item 8 of this report.\nThe loss sharing agreement for InterBank with the FDIC is subject to limitations on the types of losses covered and the length of time losses are covered, and is conditioned upon the Bank complying with its requirements in the agreement with the FDIC, including requirements regarding servicing and other loan administration matters. The original terms of the loss sharing agreement extends for ten years for single family real estate loans and for five years for other loans. As noted above, the loss sharing agreements for Team Bank, Vantus Bank and Sun Security Bank were terminated on April 26, 2016.\nAt December 31, 2016, approximately five and one half years remained on the loss sharing agreement for single family real estate loans acquired from InterBank and the remaining loans had an estimated average life of four to twelve years. At December 31, 2016, approximately six months remained on the loss sharing agreement for non-single-family loans acquired from InterBank and the remaining loans had an estimated average life of one to two years. While the expected repayments for certain of the acquired loans extend beyond the terms of the loss sharing agreement, the Bank has identified and will continue to identify problem loans and will make every effort to resolve them within the time limits of the agreement. The Company may sell any loans remaining at the end of the loss sharing agreement subject to the approval of the FDIC.\nLoans that were acquired through FDIC-assisted transactions, which are accounted for in pools, are currently included in the analysis and estimation of the allowance for loan losses. If expected cash flows to be received on any given pool of loans decreases from previous estimates, then a determination is made as to whether the loan pool should be charged down or the allowance for loan losses should be increased (through a provision for loan losses). This is true of all acquired loan pools regardless of whether or not they are covered by a loss sharing agreement. If a charge down occurs to a loan pool that is covered by the loss sharing agreement, the full amount of the charge down will be reflected in the allowance for loan losses and a separate asset will be recorded for the amount to be recovered from the FDIC. The loss sharing agreements (both current and terminated) and their related limitations are described in detail in Note 4 of the accompanying audited financial statements, included in Item 8 of this Report. For acquired loan pools that currently are not covered by loss sharing agreements, the Company may allocate, and at December 31, 2016, has allocated, a portion of its allowance for loan losses related to these loan pools in a manner similar to how it allocates its allowance for loan losses to those loans which are collectively evaluated for impairment.\nThe level of non-performing loans and foreclosed assets affects our net interest income and net income. We generally do not accrue interest income on these loans and do not recognize interest income until the loans are repaid or interest payments have been made for a period of time sufficient to provide evidence of performance on the loans. Generally, the higher the level of non-performing assets, the greater the negative impact on interest income and net income.\nAvailable-for-sale Securities. In the year ended December 31, 2016, available-for-sale securities decreased $49.0 million, or 18.6%, from $262.9 million at December 31, 2015, to $213.9 million at December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to calls of municipal securities, sales of certain mortgage-backed securities, the sale of an investment in a managed equity fund held by the Company, and normal monthly payments received related to the portfolio of mortgage-backed securities, partially offset by the purchase of certain mortgage-backed securities. The Company was required to divest the investment it held in the managed equity fund as a result of regulations recently adopted by the Federal Reserve Board. Other investment securities were reduced because they were no longer needed for pledging for public fund deposits.\nPremises and Equipment, net. Great Southern had net premises and equipment of $140.6 million at December 31, 2016, an increase of $10.9 million, or 8.4%, from $129.7 million at December 31, 2015. The increase in premises and equipment was primarily due to the acquisition of 12 branches from Fifth Third Bank in January 2016. For further information on the acquisition, see the Company's March 31, 2016 Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The Company's goodwill and other intangible assets totaled $12.5 million at December 31, 2016, an increase of $6.7 million, or 117.1%, compared to $5.8 million at December 31, 2015. The increase was due to the goodwill and core deposit intangible amounts recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2016 related to the Fifth Third Bank branch acquisition, as discussed above in the \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets\" section of this report.\nDeposits. The Company attracts deposit accounts through its retail branch network, correspondent banking and corporate services areas, and brokered deposits. The Company then utilizes these deposit funds, along with FHLBank advances and other borrowings, to meet loan demand or otherwise fund its activities. In the year ended December 31, 2016, total deposit balances increased $408.6 million, or 12.5%. Transaction account balances increased $212.0 million, while retail certificates of deposit increased $156.1 million. These increases were primarily a result of the Bank's assumption of deposits as part of the Fifth Third Bank branch acquisition in January 2016, as well as growth at existing branches and new retail certificate of deposit product offerings. Great Southern Bank customer deposits totaling $14.0 million and $12.2 million, at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, were part of the CDARS program which allows bank customers to maintain balances in an insured manner that would otherwise exceed the FDIC deposit insurance limit. The FDIC counts these deposits as brokered, but these are deposit accounts that we generate with customers in our local markets. Brokered deposits, including CDARS program purchased funds, were $310.3 million at December 31, 2016, an increase of $38.8 million from $271.5 million at December 31, 2015.\nOur deposit balances may fluctuate depending on customer preferences and our relative need for funding. We do not consider our retail certificates of deposit to be guaranteed long-term funding because customers can withdraw their funds at any time with minimal interest penalty. When loan demand trends upward, we can increase rates paid on deposits to increase deposit balances and utilize brokered deposits to provide additional funding. The level of competition for deposits in our markets is high. It is our goal to gain deposit market share, particularly checking accounts, in our branch footprint. To accomplish this goal, increasing rates to attract deposits may be necessary, which could negatively impact the Company's net interest margin.\nOur ability to fund growth in future periods may also depend on our ability to continue to access brokered deposits and FHLBank advances. In times when our loan demand has outpaced our generation of new deposits, we have utilized brokered deposits and FHLBank advances to fund these loans. These funding sources have been attractive to us because we can create either fixed or variable rate funding, as desired, which more closely matches the interest rate nature of much of our loan portfolio. While we do not currently anticipate that our ability to access these sources will be reduced or eliminated in future periods, if this should happen, the limitation on our ability to fund additional loans could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nShort-term Borrowings and Federal Home Loan Bank Advances. Federal Home Loan Bank advances decreased $232.0 million from $263.5 million at December 31, 2015 to $31.5 million at December 31, 2016. The decreased advances were replaced with overnight fed funds borrowings through the FHLBank based on funding needs. As such, short-term borrowings increased by $171.0 million, from $1.3 million at December 31, 2015 to $172.3 million at December 31, 2016. The overnight fed funds borrowing rate was lower than the one week or longer term rates for FHLBank advances, so the Company elected to utilize the overnight borrowings.\nSubordinated Notes. In August 2016, the Company issued $75 million of 5.25% fixed-to-floating rate Subordinated Notes due August 15, 2026. The notes were sold at par, resulting in net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and commissions and other issuance costs, of approximately $73.5 million. The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes.\nNet Interest Income and Interest Rate Risk Management. Our net interest income may be affected positively or negatively by changes in market interest rates. A portion of our loan portfolio is tied to the \"prime rate\" and adjusts immediately when this rate adjusts (subject to the effect of loan interest rate floors, which are discussed below). We monitor our sensitivity to interest rate changes on an ongoing basis (see \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\"). In addition, our net interest income may be impacted by changes in the cash flows expected to be received from acquired loan pools. As described in Note 4 of the accompanying audited financial statements, which are included in Item 8 of this report, the Company's evaluation of cash flows expected to be received from acquired loan pools is on-going and increases in cash flow expectations are recognized as increases in accretable yield through interest income. Decreases in cash flow expectations are recognized as impairments through the allowance for loan losses.\nThe current level and shape of the interest rate yield curve poses challenges for interest rate risk management. Prior to its increases of 0.25% on December 16, 2015 and 0.25% on December 14, 2016, the FRB last changed interest rates on December 16, 2008. Great Southern has a substantial portion of its loan portfolio ($1.02 billion at December 31, 2016) which is tied to the one-month LIBOR index and will adjust at least once within 90 days after December 31, 2016. Of these loans, $471 million had interest rate floors.\nGreat Southern also has a significant portfolio of loans ($387 million at December 31, 2016) which are tied to a \"prime rate\" of interest and will adjust immediately with changes to the \"prime rate\" of interest. Most of these loans are tied to some national index of \"prime,\" while some are indexed to \"Great Southern Bank prime\" (GSB prime). The Company had elected to leave its GSB prime rate at 5.00%, but increased this rate to 5.25% in December 2015 following the FRB rate increase. The GSB prime rate was not changed following the FRB rate increase in December 2016. This does not affect a large number of customers, as there is no longer a significant portion of the loan portfolio indexed to the GSB prime rate. But for the interest rate floors, a rate cut by the FRB generally would have an anticipated immediate negative impact on the Company's net interest income due to the large total balance of loans which generally adjust immediately as the Federal Funds rate adjusts. Loans at their floor rates are, however, subject to the risk that\nborrowers will seek to refinance elsewhere at the lower market rate. Because the Federal Funds rate is already very low, there may also be a negative impact on the Company's net interest income due to the Company's inability to significantly lower its funding costs in the current competitive rate environment, although interest rates on assets may decline further. Conversely, interest rate increases would normally result in increased interest rates on our prime-based loans. The interest rate floors in effect may limit the immediate increase in interest rates on certain of these loans, until such time as rates rise above the floors. However, the Company may have to increase rates paid on deposits to maintain deposit balances and pay higher rates on borrowings. The impact of the low rate environment on our net interest margin in future periods is expected to be fairly neutral. Any margin gained by rate increases on loans may be somewhat offset by reduced yields from our investment securities and our existing loan portfolio as payments are made and the proceeds are potentially reinvested at lower rates. Interest rates on certain adjustable rate mortgage-backed securities and loans may reset lower according to their contractual terms and index rate to which they are tied and new loans may be originated at lower market rates than the overall portfolio rate. For further discussion of the processes used to manage our exposure to interest rate risk, see \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - How We Measure the Risks to Us Associated with Interest Rate Changes.\"\nThe negative impact of declining loan interest rates had been mitigated by the positive effects of the Company's loans which have interest rate floors. At December 31, 2016, the Company had a portfolio (excluding the loans acquired in the FDIC-assisted transactions) of prime-based loans totaling approximately $387 million with rates that change immediately with changes to the prime rate of interest. Of those loans, $382 million also had interest rate floors. These floors were at varying rates, with $8 million of these loans having floor rates of 7.0% or greater and another $76 million of these loans having floor rates between 5.0% and 7.0%. In addition, $298 million of these loans have floor rates between 2.75% and 5.0%. At December 31, 2016, $93 million of these loans were at their floor rates. Also included in these prime-based loans at December 31, 2016, the Company had a portfolio (excluding the loans acquired in the FDIC-assisted transactions) of GSB prime-based loans totaling approximately $60 million with rates that change immediately with changes to the GSB prime rate of interest. Of those loans, $58 million also had interest rate floors. At December 31, 2016, $16 million of the $58 million GSB prime rate loans with interest rate floors were at their floor rates. The loan yield for the total loan portfolio was approximately 83 basis points, 106 basis points and 141 basis points higher than the national \"prime rate of interest\" at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, partly because of these interest rate floors. While interest rate floors have had an overall positive effect on the Company's results during this period, they do subject the Company to the risk that borrowers will elect to refinance their loans with other lenders. To the extent economic conditions improve, the risk that borrowers will seek to refinance their loans increases.\nNon-Interest Income and Operating Expenses. The Company's profitability is also affected by the level of its non-interest income and operating expenses. Non-interest income consists primarily of service charges and ATM fees, accretion income (net of amortization) related to the FDIC-assisted acquisitions, late charges and prepayment fees on loans, gains on sales of loans and available-for-sale investments and other general operating income. In 2014, 2012, 2011 and 2009, non-interest income was also affected by the gains recognized on the FDIC-assisted transactions. In early 2016 and all of 2015 and 2014, increases in the cash flows expected to be collected from the FDIC-covered loan portfolios resulted in amortization (expense) recorded relating to reductions of expected reimbursements under the loss sharing agreements with the FDIC, which are recorded as indemnification assets. This is no longer the case for the TeamBank, Vantus Bank and Sun Security Bank transactions, subsequent to April 26, 2016 (due to the termination of the related loss sharing agreements effective as of that date). It is still the case for InterBank loans. Non-interest income may also be affected by the Company's interest rate derivative activities, if the Company chooses to implement derivatives.\nOperating expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits, occupancy-related expenses, expenses related to foreclosed assets, postage, FDIC deposit insurance, advertising and public relations, telephone, professional fees, office expenses and other general operating expenses. Details of the current period changes in non-interest income and non-interest expense are provided under \"Results of Operations and Comparison for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\"\nBusiness Initiatives\nThe Company completed several initiatives to expand and enhance the franchise in 2016.\nDuring 2016, the Company decreased its banking center network from 110 to 104 full-service retail offices. The Company regularly evaluates its banking center network and lines of business to ensure that it is serving customers in the best way possible. The banking center network constantly evolves with changes in customer needs and preferences, emerging technology and local market developments. In response to these changes, the Company opens banking centers and invests resources where customer demand leads, and from time to time, consolidates banking centers when market conditions dictate.\nOn January 29, 2016, Great Southern completed the acquisition of 12 branches and related deposits and loans from Cincinnati-based Fifth Third Bank in the St. Louis market area. This acquisition increased Great Southern's St. Louis-area banking center total from eight to ultimately 19 offices and doubled its customer deposit base in this market. The deposits assumed totaled approximately $228 million and the loans acquired totaled approximately $159 million.\nThroughout 2016, the Company consolidated operations of 16 banking centers into other nearby Great Southern offices. Each consolidated office was evaluated on a number of criteria, including access and availability of services to affected customers, the proximity of other Great Southern banking centers, profitability and transaction volumes and market dynamics. Of these 16 consolidated banking centers, eleven were in Missouri, four in Iowa and one was in Kansas. Nine of these banking centers were acquired as part of various FDIC-assisted acquisitions. In addition, the Company also sold two Missouri banking centers, with associated deposits, to separate buyers in early 2016. The Great Southern banking center located in Thayer, Mo., was sold on February 19, 2016, and the office in Buffalo, Mo., was sold on March 18, 2016.\nIn addition, in January 2017, two leased banking centers were replaced by two new owned offices in the Omaha, Neb., metropolitan market area. Both new locations offer better convenience and access to area customers. Great Southern operates four offices in the Omaha market area.\nThe Company executed an agreement with the FDIC to terminate loss sharing agreements related to the FDIC-assisted acquisitions of TeamBank, Vantus Bank and Sun Security Bank in April 2016. The agreement required the FDIC to pay $4.4 million to settle all outstanding items related to the terminated loss sharing agreements. As a result of entering into the agreement, assets that were covered by the terminated loss sharing agreements, including covered loans in the amount of $61.5 million and covered other real estate owned in the amount of $468,000 as of March 31, 2016, were reclassified as non-covered assets effective April 26, 2016. More information about this agreement can be found in the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016.\nIn July 2016, the Company filed a universal shelf registration statement (Form S-3) with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This registration allows the Company to expeditiously offer investors up to a total of $250 million in common stock, preferred stock, trust preferred securities or debt obligations. With the Board's prior approval, public offerings can be made at various times and for various amounts depending on the needs of the Company.\nIn August 2016, utilizing the shelf registration statement, the Company completed the public offering and sale of $75 million of its 5.25% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due August 15, 2026. The Notes were sold at par, resulting in net proceeds, after underwriting discounts, commissions and expenses, of approximately $73.5 million. The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes.\nIn October 2016, the Company began mass issuing chip-enabled debit cards in phases to its deposit customer base. The mass issuance was completed in February 2017. Chip debit cards offer customers an added layer of security, providing enhanced protection against fraud. Chip debit cards are also available instantly at all Great Southern banking centers.\nThe Company expects to open a commercial loan production office in downtown Chicago in the first quarter of 2017. A local and highly experienced commercial lender has been hired to manage that office. The Company also operates commercial loan production offices in Tulsa, Okla., and Dallas.\nA person-to-person (P2P) electronic payment service was introduced in early February 2017. Available for retail customers through the Company's smartphone mobile banking applications, the P2P service allows Great Southern debit card customers to send one-time transfers to recipients at any financial institution.\nThe Company's chief lending officer, Steve Mitchem, previously announced his plans to retire from the Company in April 2017. Mr. Mitchem joined Great Southern in 1990. During his tenure, the Company's loan portfolio grew from $360 million, with lending operations primarily in the southwest Missouri region, to $3.8 billion with lending operations in eight states. Mr. Mitchem and the Company began planning for his pending retirement more than a year ago to ensure a smooth management transition. At that time, the Company restructured the lending division to better reflect the Company's size and scope. The lending division now has two separate areas of responsibility - loan production led by John Bugh and credit administration led by Kevin Baker. Mr. Bugh and Mr. Baker are long-term Great Southern lenders, who each have more than 27 years of banking experience.\nEffect of Federal Laws and Regulations\nGeneral. Federal legislation and regulation significantly affect the operations of the Company and the Bank, and have increased competition among commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking enterprises and other financial institutions. In particular, the capital requirements and operations of regulated banking organizations such as the Company and the Bank have been and will be subject to changes in applicable statutes and regulations from time to time, which changes could, under certain circumstances, adversely affect the Company or the Bank.\nSignificant Legislation Impacting the Financial Services Industry. On July 21, 2010, sweeping financial regulatory reform legislation entitled the \"Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act\" (the \"Dodd-Frank Act\") was signed into law. The Dodd-\nFrank Act implements far-reaching changes across the financial regulatory landscape, including provisions that, among other things, centralize responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating a new agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, with broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks, require new capital rules (discussed below), change the assessment base for federal deposit insurance, repeal the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits, amend the account balance limit for federal deposit insurance protection, and increase the authority of the Federal Reserve Board to examine the Company and its non-bank subsidiaries.\nMany aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to rulemaking and will take effect over a number of years, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on the Company and the financial services industry more generally. Provisions in the legislation that affect deposit insurance assessments and payment of interest on demand deposits could increase the costs associated with deposits. Provisions in the legislation that require revisions to the capital requirements of the Company and the Bank could require the Company and the Bank to seek additional sources of capital in the future.\nA provision of the Dodd-Frank Act, commonly referred to as the \"Durbin Amendment,\" directed the FRB to analyze the debit card payments system and fix the interchange rates based upon their estimate of actual costs. The FRB has established the interchange rate for all debit transactions for issuers with over $10 billion in assets at $0.21 per transaction. An additional five basis points of the transaction amount and an additional $0.01 may be collected by the issuer for fraud prevention and recovery, provided the issuer performs certain actions. The Bank is currently exempt from the rule on the basis of asset size.\nNew Capital Rules. The federal banking agencies have adopted new regulatory capital rules that substantially amend the risk-based capital rules applicable to the Bank and the Company. The new rules implement the \"Basel III\" regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. \"Basel III\" refers to various documents released by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. For the Company and the Bank, the general effective date of the new rules was January 1, 2015, and, for certain provisions, various phase-in periods and later effective dates apply. The chief features of the new rules are summarized below.\nThe new rules refine the definitions of what constitutes regulatory capital and add a new regulatory capital element, common equity Tier 1 capital. The minimum capital ratios are (i) a common equity Tier 1 (\"CET1\") risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6%; (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 8%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. In addition to the minimum capital ratios, the new rules include a capital conservation buffer, under which a banking organization must have CET1 more than 2.5% above each of its minimum risk-based capital ratios in order to avoid restrictions on paying dividends, repurchasing shares, and paying certain discretionary bonuses. The new capital conservation buffer requirement began phasing in beginning on January 1, 2016 when a buffer greater than 0.625% of risk-weighted assets was required, which amount will increase an equal amount each year until the buffer requirement of greater than 2.5% of risk-weighted assets is fully implemented on January 1, 2019.\nEffective January 1, 2015, the new rules also revised the prompt corrective action framework, which is designed to place restrictions on insured depository institutions if their capital levels show signs of weakness. Under the new prompt corrective action requirements, insured depository institutions are required to meet the following in order to qualify as \"well capitalized:\" (i) a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.5%, (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%, (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10% and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5%, and must not be subject to an order, agreement or directive mandating a specific capital level.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 to the accompanying audited financial statements, which are included in Item 8 of this Report, for a description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective dates of adoption and expected effects on the Company's financial position and results of operations.\nComparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, total assets increased by $446.5 million to $4.55 billion. The increase was primarily attributable to the loan, premises and equipment and intangible assets related to the Fifth Third Bank branch acquisition, as well as an increase in loans originated by the Bank and cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by reductions in available-for-sale investment securities and the FDIC indemnification asset.\nNet loans increased $419.4 million to $3.76 billion at December 31, 2016. Outstanding and undisbursed balances of other residential (multi-family) loans increased $243.8 million, or 58.1%, commercial construction loans increased $179.8 million, or 29.9%, commercial real estate loans increased $143.4 million, or 13.7%, owner occupied one- to four-family residential loans increased $90.1 million, or 81.7%, and consumer auto loans increased $54.3 million, or 12.4%. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in net loans acquired through the FDIC-assisted transactions of $79.7 million, or 22.0%, primarily because of loan repayments.\nRelated to the loans purchased in the 2012, 2011 and 2009 FDIC-assisted transactions, the Company originally recorded indemnification assets which represented payments expected to be received from the FDIC through loss sharing agreements. As noted previously, the loss sharing agreements for Team Bank, Vantus Bank and Sun Security Bank, and the related remaining indemnification assets were terminated during 2016. The remaining balance of the FDIC indemnification is related to InterBank, and the total amount at December 31, 2016 was $13.1 million, a decrease of $11.0 million from $24.1 million at December 31, 2015, $21.1 million of which related to InterBank. The 2014 Valley Bank acquisition did not include a loss sharing agreement with the FDIC; therefore, no indemnification asset was recorded as part of the transaction.\nSecurities available for sale decreased $49.0 million, or 18.6%, as compared to December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to calls of municipal securities and U. S. government agency securities, sales of certain mortgage-backed securities, the sale of an investment in a managed equity fund held by the Company, and normal monthly payments received related to the portfolio of mortgage-backed securities, partially offset by the purchase of certain mortgage-backed securities. The Company was required to divest the investment it held in the managed equity fund as a result of regulations recently adopted by the Federal Reserve Board. Other investment securities were reduced because they were no longer needed for pledging for public fund deposits. The available-for-sale securities portfolio was 4.7% and 6.4% of total assets at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nCash and cash equivalents were $279.8 million at December 31, 2016, an increase of $80.6 million, or 40.5%, from $199.2 million at December 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2016, cash and cash equivalents increased primarily due to the cash received in the Fifth Third Bank transaction, sales of and payments received on available-for-sale securities, increases in deposits and the net proceeds of the issuance of $75.0 million of subordinated notes. This increase in cash and cash equivalents was partially offset by using a portion of the cash to fund loan growth.\nNet premises and equipment increased $10.9 million from December 31, 2015, primarily due to the branches acquired in the Fifth Third Bank transaction, partially offset by the transfer of branch properties closed in January 2016 to other real estate owned and the sale of two branches.\nThe Company's goodwill and other intangible assets totaled $12.5 million at December 31, 2016, an increase of $6.7 million, or 117.1%, compared to $5.8 million at December 31, 2015. The increase was due to the goodwill and core deposit intangible amounts recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2016 related to the Fifth Third Bank branch acquisition, as discussed above in the \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets\" section of this report.\nTotal liabilities increased $414.9 million from $3.71 billion at December 31, 2015 to $4.12 billion at December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in deposits and the issuance of subordinated notes. Deposits increased due to the deposits assumed in the Fifth Third Bank branch transaction, as well as growth in the Company's existing deposits and brokered deposits. In the year ended December 31, 2016, total deposit balances increased $408.6 million, or 12.5%. Transaction account balances increased $212.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, while retail certificates of deposit increased $156.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nFederal Home Loan Bank advances decreased $232.0 million, from $263.5 million at December 31, 2015 to $31.5 million at December 31, 2016. The decreased advances were replaced with overnight fed funds borrowings through the FHLBank based on funding needs. As such, short-term borrowings increased by $171.0 million, from $1.3 million at December 31, 2015 to $172.3 million at December 31, 2016. The overnight fed funds borrowing rate was lower than the one week or longer term rates for FHLBank advances, so the Company elected to utilize the overnight borrowings.\nIn August 2016, the Company issued $75 million of 5.25% fixed-to-floating rate Subordinated Notes due August 15, 2026. The notes were sold at par, resulting in net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and commissions and other issuance costs, of approximately $73.5 million. The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes.\nTotal stockholders' equity increased $31.6 million from $398.2 million at December 31, 2015 to $429.8 million at December 31, 2016. The Company recorded net income of $45.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and dividends declared on common stock were $12.2 million. Accumulated other comprehensive income decreased $4.1 million. The decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income resulted from decreases in the fair value of the Company's available-for-sale investment securities. In addition, total stockholders' equity increased $2.6 million due to stock option exercises.\nResults of Operations and Comparison for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nGeneral\nNet income decreased $1.2 million, or 2.5%, during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Net income was $45.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $46.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was due to an increase in non-interest expense of $6.1 million, or 5.3%, a decrease in net interest income of $5.3 million, or 3.1%, an increase in the provision for loan losses of $3.8 million, or 68.2% and an increase in provision for income taxes of $952,000, or 6.1%, partially offset by an increase in non-interest income of $14.9 million, or 109.9%. Net income available to common shareholders was $45.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $45.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nTotal Interest Income\nTotal interest income increased $824,000, or 0.4%, during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was due to a $1.6 million, or 0.9%, increase in interest income on loans, partially offset by an $819,000, or 11.5%, decrease in interest income on investment securities and other interest-earning assets. Interest income on loans increased in 2016 due to higher average balances on loans, partially offset by lower average rates of interest. Interest income from investment securities and other interest-earning assets decreased during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to lower average balances, partially offset by higher average rates of interest.\nInterest Income - Loans\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, interest income on loans increased due to higher average balances, partially offset by lower average interest rates. Interest income increased $21.8 million as the result of higher average loan balances, which increased from $3.24 billion during the year ended December 31, 2015, to $3.66 billion during the year ended December 31, 2016. The higher average balances were primarily due to organic loan growth, in addition to the loans obtained as part of the Fifth Third Bank branch acquisition. Interest income decreased $20.2 million as the result of lower average interest rates on loans. The average yield on loans decreased from 5.48% during the year ended December 31, 2015 to 4.89% during the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was due to lower overall loan rates, and a lower amount of accretion income in the current year resulting from the increases in expected cash flows to be received from the FDIC-acquired loan pools, which is discussed in Note 4 of the accompanying audited financial statements, which are included in Item 8 of this report.\nOn an on-going basis, the Company estimates the cash flows expected to be collected from the acquired loan pools. This cash flows estimate has increased, based on the payment histories and the collection of certain loans, thereby reducing loss expectations of certain loan pools, resulting in adjustments to be spread on a level-yield basis over the remaining expected lives of the loan pools. The loss sharing agreements for the Team Bank, Vantus Bank and Sun Security Bank transactions were terminated in April 2016, and the related indemnification assets were reduced to $-0- at that time. The Valley Bank transaction does not include a loss sharing agreement with the FDIC. Therefore, for these four acquisition transactions, there is no related indemnification asset. The entire amount of the discount adjustment has been and will be accreted to interest income over time with no offsetting impact to non-interest income. For the loan pools acquired in the InterBank transaction, the increases in expected cash flows also reduce the amount of expected reimbursements under the loss sharing agreement with the FDIC, which is recorded as an indemnification asset. Therefore, the expected indemnification asset has also been reduced, resulting in adjustments to be amortized on a comparable basis over the remainder of the loss sharing agreement or the remaining expected life of the loan pools, whichever is shorter. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the adjustments increased interest income by $16.4 million and $28.5 million, respectively, and decreased non-interest income by $7.0 million and $19.5 million, respectively. The net impact to pre-tax income was $9.4 million and $9.0 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the remaining accretable yield adjustment that will affect interest income is $6.3 million and the remaining adjustment to the indemnification assets related to InterBank, including the effects of the clawback liability, that will affect non-interest income (expense) is $(2.5) million. The $6.3 million of accretable yield adjustment relates to Team Bank, Vantus Bank, Sun Security Bank, InterBank and Valley Bank. The expense, as noted, is only related to InterBank, as there is no longer, nor will there be in the future, indemnification asset amortization expense related to Team Bank, Vantus Bank or Sun Security Bank due to the early termination of the remaining related loss sharing agreements for those transactions in April 2016. Of the remaining adjustments, we expect to recognize $4.3 million of interest income and $(1.7) million of non-interest income (expense) during 2017. Additional adjustments may be recorded in future periods from the FDIC-assisted acquisitions, as the Company continues to estimate expected cash flows from the acquired loan pools. Apart from the yield accretion, the average yield on loans was 4.44% during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 4.60% during the year ended December 31, 2015, as a result of loan pay-offs, normal amortization of higher-rate loans and new loans that were made at current lower market rates. Interest income also decreased due to significant interest recoveries in the prior year period, as discussed in the paragraph below.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company collected $891,000 on certain acquired loans which had previously not been expected to be collectible. These collections were recorded as interest income in 2015 and had a positive impact on the net interest margin in that year of approximately three basis points. As the loans were subject to loss sharing agreements at that time, 80% of the amounts collected, or $713,000, was recorded in 2015 and included in non-interest income under \"accretion (amortization) of income related to business acquisitions.\"\nInterest Income - Investments and Other Interest-earning Assets\nInterest income on investments and other interest-earning assets decreased $819,000 in the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Interest income decreased $1.9 million as a result of a decrease in average balances from $483.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, to $366.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. Average balances of securities decreased due to certain U. S. government agency securities and municipal securities being called, the sale of certain mortgage-backed securities, normal monthly payments received related to the portfolio of mortgage-backed securities, and the sale during the year of an investment in a managed equity fund held by the Company. Interest income increased $1.1 million due to an increase in average interest rates from 1.47% during the year ended December 31, 2015 to 1.72% during the year ended December 31, 2016, due to a higher portion of the investment portfolio in tax-exempt municipal bonds and higher market rates of interest on other interest-bearing deposits in financial institutions.\nThe Company's interest-earning deposits and non-interest-earning cash equivalents currently earn very low or no yield and therefore negatively impact the Company's net interest margin. At December 31, 2016, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $279.8 million compared to $199.2 million at December 31, 2015. See \"Net Interest Income\" for additional information on the impact of this interest activity.\nTotal Interest Expense\nTotal interest expense increased $6.1 million, or 38.3%, during the year ended December 31, 2016, when compared with the year ended December 31, 2015, due to an increase in interest expense on deposits of $3.9 million, or 28.7%, an increase in interest expense on the newly issued subordinated notes of $1.6 million, an increase in interest expense on short-term and structured repo borrowings of $1.1 million, or 1,649.2%, and an increase in interest expense on subordinated debentures issued to capital trust of $89,000, or 12.5%, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense on FHLBank advances of $493,000, or 28.9%.\nInterest Expense - Deposits\nInterest on demand deposits increased $832,000 due to an increase in average rates from 0.20% during the year ended December 31, 2015, to 0.26% during the year ended December 31, 2016. Interest on demand deposits increased $198,000 due to an increase in average balances from $1.40 billion in the year ended December 31, 2015, to $1.50 billion in the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in average balances of interest-bearing demand deposits was primarily a result of the deposits assumed as part of the Fifth Third Bank branch acquisition, partially offset by decreases in certain deposit types, such as public funds.\nInterest expense on time deposits increased $1.8 million as a result of an increase in average rates of interest from 0.85% during the year ended December 31, 2015, to 0.98% during the year ended December 31, 2016. Interest expense on time deposits increased $1.0 million due to an increase in average balances of time deposits from $1.26 billion during the year ended December 31, 2015, to $1.37 billion during the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in average balances of time deposits was primarily a result of increased balances of brokered deposits and time deposits opened through the Company's internet deposit acquisition channels. A large portion of the Company's certificate of deposit portfolio matures within six to eighteen months and therefore reprices fairly quickly; this is consistent with the portfolio over the past several years.\nInterest Expense - FHLBank Advances, Short-term Borrowings and Structured Repurchase Agreements, Subordinated Debentures Issued to Capital Trust and Subordinated Notes\nInterest expense on FHLBank advances decreased due to lower average balances, partially offset by higher average rates of interest. Interest expense on FHLBank advances decreased $1.4 million due to a decrease in average balances from $175.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, to $68.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily due to the paydown and partial replacement of short-term FHLBank advances with overnight fed funds borrowings from the FHLBank. Partially offsetting the decrease due to reduced average balances was an increase in interest expense of $919,000 due to an increase in average interest rates from 0.97% in the year ended December 31, 2015, to 1.78% in the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in the average rate was due to a change in the mix of advances compared to the prior year. Short-term advances with very low interest rates were utilized more significantly in the prior year, which caused the overall average rate to be lower. In the current year, the Company utilized more overnight borrowings from the FHLBank which are included in short-term borrowings, with the remaining balance of FHLBank advances being longer term at a higher rate.\nInterest expense on short-term borrowings and repurchase agreements increased $996,000 due to average rates that increased from 0.03% in the year ended December 31, 2015, to 0.35% in the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was due to a change in the mix of borrowings in the current period, during which overnight fed funds borrowings from the FHLBank were increased, which are at a higher interest rate than customer repurchase agreements. Interest expense on short-term borrowings and repurchase agreements increased $76,000 due to an increase in average balances from $192.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, to $327.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, which is primarily due to an increase in short-term borrowings from the FHLBank.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, interest expense on subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts increased $168,000 due to higher average interest rates. The average interest rate was 2.48% in 2015, compared to 3.12% in 2016. The increase in the interest rate resulted from the amortization of the cost of interest rate caps the Company purchased in 2013 to limit the interest rate risk from rising LIBOR rates related to the Company's subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts. Interest expense on subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts decreased $79,000 due to a decrease in average balances from $28.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $25.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. The average balance decreased because the Company redeemed $5.0 million of its subordinated debentures issued to capital trust during 2015. The remaining debentures are variable-rate debentures which bear interest at an average rate of three-month LIBOR plus 1.60%, adjusting quarterly. The average interest rate will continue to be higher than this until the third quarter of 2017 as a result of the amortization of the cost of the interest rate cap.\nIn August 2016, the Company issued $75 million of 5.25% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due August 15, 2026. The notes were sold at par, resulting in net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and commissions and other issuance costs, of approximately $73.5 million. Interest expense on the subordinated notes for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $1.6 million.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased $5.3 million to $163.1 million compared to $168.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net interest margin was 4.05% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 4.53% in 2015, a decrease of 48 basis points. In both years, the Company's net interest income and margin have been significantly impacted by the increases in expected cash flows to be received from the FDIC-acquired loan pools and the resulting increase to accretable yield, which was discussed previously in \"Interest Income - Loans\" and is discussed in Note 4 of the accompanying audited financial statements, which are included in Item 8 of this Report. The positive impact of these changes on the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were increases in interest income of $16.4 million and $28.5 million, respectively, and increases in net interest margin of 41 basis points and 77 basis points, respectively. Excluding the positive impact of the additional yield accretion, net interest margin decreased 12 basis points during the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in net interest margin was primarily due to a decrease in average interest rate on loans (primarily due to decreased interest income on loans acquired in the FDIC-assisted transactions) and an increase in the average interest rate on time deposits and borrowings, partially offset by an increase in the average interest rate on investment securities.\nThe Company's overall interest rate spread decreased 51 basis points, or 11.5%, from 4.44% during the year ended December 31, 2015, to 3.93% during the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was due to a 36 basis point decrease in the weighted average yield on interest-earning assets and a 15 basis point increase in the weighted average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. In comparing the two years, the yield on loans decreased 59 basis points while the yield on investment securities and other interest-earning assets increased 25 basis points. The rate paid on deposits increased 10 basis points, the rate paid on FHLBank advances increased 81 basis points, the rate paid on short-term borrowings increased 32 basis points and the rate paid on subordinated debentures issued to capital trust increased 64 basis points. In addition, the new subordinated notes paid interest at an average rate of 553 basis points.\nFor additional information on net interest income components, refer to the \"Average Balances, Interest Rates and Yields\" table in this Report.\nProvision for Loan Losses and Allowance for Loan Losses\nManagement records a provision for loan losses in an amount it believes sufficient to result in an allowance for loan losses that will cover current net charge-offs as well as risks believed to be inherent in the loan portfolio of the Bank. The amount of provision charged against current income is based on several factors, including, but not limited to, past loss experience, current portfolio mix, actual and potential losses identified in the loan portfolio, economic conditions, and internal as well as external reviews. The levels of non-performing assets, potential problem loans, loan loss provisions and net charge-offs fluctuate from period to period and are difficult to predict.\nWeak economic conditions, higher inflation or interest rates, or other factors may lead to increased losses in the portfolio and/or requirements for an increase in loan loss provision expense. Management maintains various controls in an attempt to limit future losses, such as a watch list of possible problem loans, documented loan administration policies and a loan review staff to review the quality and anticipated collectability of the portfolio. Additional procedures provide for frequent management review of the loan portfolio based on loan size, loan type, delinquencies, financial analysis, on-going correspondence with borrowers and problem loan work-outs. Management determines which loans are potentially uncollectible, or represent a greater risk of loss, and makes additional provisions to expense, if necessary, to maintain the allowance at a satisfactory level.\nThe provision for loan losses increased $3.8 million, to $9.3 million, during the year ended December 31, 2016, when compared with the year ended December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016, the allowance for loan losses was $37.4 million, a decrease of $749,000 from December 31, 2015. Total net charge-offs were $10.0 million and $5.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Excluding those related to loans covered by loss sharing agreements, six relationships made up $5.5 million of the total $10.0 million in net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2016. Gross charge-offs for the year were partially offset by recoveries, including recoveries on two separate relationships totaling $1.1 million, which had previously been charged off. During the year ended December 31, 2016, $3.8 million of the $10.0 million of net charge-offs were in the consumer auto category. General market conditions and unique circumstances related to individual borrowers and projects contributed to the level of provisions and charge-offs. As properties were categorized as potential problem loans, non-performing loans or foreclosed assets, evaluations were made of the values of these assets with corresponding charge-offs as appropriate.\nAt December 31, 2016, loans acquired in the InterBank FDIC-assisted transaction were covered by a loss sharing agreement between the FDIC and Great Southern Bank, which affords Great Southern Bank at least 80% protection from losses in the acquired portfolio of loans. The FDIC loss sharing agreement is subject to limitations on the types of losses covered and the length of time losses are covered and is conditioned upon the Bank complying with its requirements in the agreement with the FDIC. These limitations are described in detail in Note 4 of the accompanying financial statements, which are included in Item 8 of this report. In April 2016, the loss sharing agreements for Team Bank, Vantus Bank and Sun Security Bank were terminated. Loans acquired from the FDIC related to Valley Bank did not have a loss sharing agreement. All acquired loans were grouped into pools based on common characteristics and were recorded at their estimated fair values, which incorporated estimated credit losses at the acquisition date. These loan pools are systematically reviewed by the Company to determine the risk of losses that may exceed those identified at the time of the acquisition. Techniques used in determining risk of loss are similar to those used to determine the risk of loss for the legacy Great Southern Bank portfolio, with most focus being placed on those loan pools which include the larger loan relationships and those loan pools which exhibit higher risk characteristics. Review of the acquired loan portfolio also includes meetings with customers, review of financial information and collateral valuations to determine if any additional losses are apparent.\nThe allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans, excluding acquired covered and non-covered loans, was 1.04% and 1.20% at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover losses inherent in the Company's loan portfolio at December 31, 2016, based on recent reviews of the Company's loan portfolio and current economic conditions. If economic conditions were to deteriorate or management's assessment of the loan portfolio were to change, it is possible that additional loan loss provisions would be required, thereby adversely affecting future results of operations and financial condition.\nNon-performing Assets\nFormer TeamBank, Vantus Bank, Sun Security Bank and InterBank non-performing assets, including foreclosed assets and potential problem loans, are not included in the totals or in the discussion of non-performing loans, potential problem loans and foreclosed assets below as they are, or were, subject to loss sharing agreements with the FDIC, which cover at least 80% of principal losses that may be incurred in these portfolios for the applicable terms under the agreements. In addition, these assets were initially recorded at their estimated fair values as of their acquisition dates. The overall performance of the loan pools acquired in 2009, 2011 and 2012 in FDIC-assisted transactions has been better than original expectations as of the acquisition dates. Former Valley Bank loans are also excluded from the totals and the discussion of non-performing loans, potential problem loans and foreclosed assets below, although they are not covered by a loss sharing agreement. Former Valley Bank loans are accounted for in pools and were recorded at their fair value at the time of the acquisition; therefore, these loan pools are analyzed rather than the individual loans.\nAs previously discussed, the remaining loss sharing agreements for Team Bank, Vantus Bank and Sun Security Bank were terminated in April 2016. Loss sharing agreements covering single-family loans and foreclosed assets and non-single-family loans and foreclosed assets related to the Inter Savings Bank FDIC-assisted acquisition are still in place in accordance with their contractual terms.\nAs a result of changes in balances and composition of the loan portfolio, changes in economic and market conditions that occur from time to time, and other factors specific to a borrower's circumstances, the level of non-performing assets will fluctuate.\nNon-performing assets, excluding FDIC-covered and formerly covered non-performing assets and other FDIC-assisted acquired assets, at December 31, 2016, were $39.3 million, a decrease of $4.7 from $44.0 million at December 31, 2015. Non-performing assets, excluding FDIC-covered and formerly covered non-performing assets and other FDIC-assisted acquired assets, as a percentage of total assets were 0.86% at December 31, 2016, compared to 1.07% at December 31, 2015.\nCompared to December 31, 2015, non-performing loans decreased $2.5 million to $14.1 million at December 31, 2016, and foreclosed assets decreased $2.1 million to $25.2 million at December 31, 2016. Non-performing commercial real estate loans comprised $4.4 million, or 31.3%, of the total of $14.1 million of non-performing loans at December 31, 2016. The majority of the decrease in the commercial real estate category was due to one relationship where the notes were sold and the loans paid off after charge-offs of $2.0 million during 2016. Another relationship totaling $982,000 was transferred to foreclosed assets. In addition, $3.1 million of the transfers to foreclosed assets in the commercial real estate category and approximately $670,000 of the charge-offs were related to another relationship. Non-performing commercial business loans were $3.1 million, or 21.9%, of total non-performing loans at December 31, 2016. The increase in non-performing commercial business loans was primarily due to the addition of one relationship in 2016. Non-performing consumer loans were $2.6 million, or 18.7%, of total non-performing loans at December 31, 2016. Non-performing one-to four-family residential loans comprised $2.0 million, or 13.9%, of the total non-performing loans at December 31, 2016. Non-performing land development loans were $1.7 million, or 12.2%, of total non-performing loans at December 31, 2016. The increase in non-performing land development loans was primarily due to the addition of one relationship in 2016.\nNon-performing Loans. Activity in the non-performing loans category during the year ended December 31, 2016, was as follows:\n\nAt December 31, 2016, the non-performing commercial real estate category included 10 loans, seven of which were added during the year. The largest relationship in this category, which was added prior to 2016, totaled $1.7 million, or 38.5% of the total category, and is collateralized by a theatre property in Branson, Mo. One relationship in this category, which had a balance of $6.5 million at December 31, 2015, had $2.0 million in charge-offs and $5.1 million in payments (net of operating funds advanced) during the year. The relationship was collateralized by three operating long-term health care facilities in Missouri. These related notes were sold during 2016 for payment of the amount of the remaining balances after the charge-offs, resulting in a balance of zero at December 31, 2016. During 2016, $3.1 million of the transfers to foreclosed assets in the commercial real estate category and approximately $670,000 of the charge-offs were related to another relationship. This relationship is secured by property located in the Branson, Mo., area, and includes a lakefront resort, marina and related amenities, condominiums and lots. In addition to those relationships already discussed, $3.8 million of the transfers to foreclosed assets in the commercial real estate category during the year related to three additional relationships. The non-performing commercial business category included five loans, four of which were added during 2016. The largest loan in this category, which was added in 2016, totaled $3.0 million, or 95.6% of the total category, and is secured by the borrower's interest in a condo project in Branson, Mo. The Bank's lending involvement with this project dates back to 2005. This project had experienced some performance difficulties in the past and a new borrower became involved in this project during 2013. The non-performing one- to four-family residential category included 38 loans, 27 of which were added during 2016. The non-performing land development category included two loans. The largest loan in this category, which was originated in 2007, totaled $1.6 million, or 95.1% of the total category, and was collateralized by land in the St. Louis, Mo. area. The non-performing consumer category included 188 loans, 174 of which were added during 2016.\nForeclosed Assets. Of the total $32.7 million of other real estate owned at December 31, 2016, $1.4 million represents the fair value of foreclosed assets covered by FDIC loss sharing agreements, $316,000 represents the fair value of foreclosed assets previously covered by FDIC loss sharing agreements, $2.0 million represents foreclosed assets related to Valley Bank and not covered by loss sharing agreements, $9,000 represents other repossessed assets related to acquired loans, and $3.7 million represents properties which were not acquired through foreclosure, including former branch locations that have been closed and are held for sale and land which\nwas acquired for a potential branch location . The acquired loss share covered and non-covered foreclosed and other assets acquired in the FDIC-assisted transactions and the properties not acquired through foreclosure are not included in the following table and discussion of other real estate owned. Because sales of foreclosed properties exceeded additions, total foreclosed assets decreased. Activity in foreclosed assets during the year ended December 31, 2016, was as follows:\n\nAt December 31, 2016, the land development category of foreclosed assets included 22 properties, the largest of which was located in northwest Arkansas and had a balance of $1.4 million, or 12.6% of the total category. Of the total dollar amount in the land development category of foreclosed assets, 39.1% and 33.1% was located in the Branson, Mo. area and in the northwest Arkansas area, respectively, including the largest property previously mentioned. The subdivision construction category of foreclosed assets included 27 properties, the largest of which was located in the Springfield, Mo. metropolitan area and had a balance of $1.2 million, or 19.4% of the total category. Of the total dollar amount in the subdivision construction category of foreclosed assets, 29.4% and 19.4% is located in Branson, Mo. and Springfield, Mo., respectively, including the largest property previously mentioned. The commercial real estate category of foreclosed assets included six properties. The largest relationship in the commercial real estate category, which includes two properties which were added during 2016, totaled $1.5 million, or 39.6% of the total category, and is made up of commercial retail property in Texas and Georgia, which was previously in non-performing loans. The second largest relationship in the commercial real estate category, which was added during 2016, totaled $1.3 million, or 33.3% of the total category, and is a hotel located in the western United States, which was previously in non-performing loans. The $6.2 million in sales in the commercial real estate category of foreclosed assets was primarily from three properties. Sales of $2.1 million related to a property which is located in southeast Missouri and was added in 2015. Sales of $2.9 million related to a property located in the Branson, Mo., area, and included a lakefront resort, marina and related amenities, condominiums and lots. Sales of $982,000 related to a motel property located in Springfield, Mo. The one-to four-family residential category of foreclosed assets included nine properties, of which the largest relationship, with one property in the southwest Missouri area, had a balance of $421,000, or 34.6% of the total category. Of the total dollar amount in the one-to- four-family category of foreclosed assets, 44.4% is located in the Branson, Mo., area. The other residential category of foreclosed assets included five properties, four of which were part of the same condominium community, located in Branson, Mo. and had a balance of $694,000, or 72.7% of the total category. The sales of $1.3 million in the other residential category were from six additional properties that were part of the same condominium community which were sold during 2016. The larger amount of additions and sales under consumer loans are due to a higher volume of repossessions of automobiles, which generally are subject to a shorter repossession process. Compared to previous years, in 2016 the Company experienced increased levels of delinquencies and repossessions in consumer loans, primarily indirect used automobile loans.\nPotential Problem Loans. Potential problem loans decreased $5.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, from $12.8 million at December 31, 2015 to $7.0 million at December 31, 2016. This decrease was due to $6.0 million in loans transferred to the non-performing category, $2.6 million in loans removed from potential problem loans due to improvements in the credits, $2.2 million in charge-offs, $65,000 in loans transferred to foreclosed assets, and $3.4 million in payments on potential problem loans, partially offset by the addition of $8.5 million of loans to potential problem loans. Potential problem loans are loans which management has identified through routine internal review procedures as having possible credit problems that may cause the borrowers difficulty in complying with current repayment terms. These loans are not reflected in non-performing assets, but are considered in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Activity in the potential problem loans category during the year ended December 31, 2016, was as follows:\n\nAt December 31, 2016, the land development category of potential problem loans included three loans. The largest loan in this category, which was added prior to 2016 and is collateralized by property in the Branson, Mo., area, totaled $3.8 million, or 92.9% of the total category. The commercial real estate category of potential problem loans included four loans, all of which were added prior to 2016. The largest relationship in this category contains two loans, with a total balance of $1.3 million, or 63.4% of the commercial real estate category. This relationship is collateralized by commercial entertainment property and other property in Branson, Mo. Two relationships made up $4.5 million in transfers to non-performing assets and $1.8 million in charge-offs in the commercial real estate category during 2016. These relationships are discussed above under non-performing loans. Of the $1.4 million in payments in this category, 95% was related to one loan, which was paid in full during 2016. The other residential category of potential problem loans has a balance of zero at December 31, 2016. During the year, payment was received in full on one loan which was previously included in the other residential category of potential problem loans totaling $2.0 million. This loan was to the same borrower that was referenced above in the land development category.\nNon-Interest Income\nNon-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $28.5 million compared with $13.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of $14.9 million, or 109.9 %, was primarily the result of the following items:\nAmortization of income related to business acquisitions: The net amortization expense related to business acquisitions was reduced to $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2016, consisted of the following items: $5.8 million of amortization expense related to the changes in cash flows expected to be collected from the FDIC-covered loan portfolios, $584,000 of impairment to certain indemnification assets and $1.4 million of amortization of the clawback liability. The impairment of the indemnification asset was recorded pursuant to the expected loss on the FDIC loss share termination agreements that occurred in April 2016, as discussed in the Company's March 31, 2016 Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Partially offsetting the expense was income from the accretion of the discount related to the indemnification asset for the InterBank acquisition of $896,000.\nNet realized gains on sales of available-for-sale securities: During 2016, the Company sold an investment held at the holding company level for a gain of $2.7 million. This investment, the original amount of which was $1.0 million, was made in a managed equity fund. The Company was required to divest this investment as a result of recent regulations enacted by the Federal Reserve Board. There were no material gains on sales of investments in 2015.\nService charges and ATM fees: Service charges and ATM fees increased $1.8 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to the additional accounts acquired in the Fifth Third Bank transaction in January 2016, which have had high levels of debit card activity, and overall higher levels of point-of-sale card activity.\nOther income: Other income decreased $918,000 compared to the prior year. During 2015, the Company recorded a $1.1 million gain when it redeemed the trust preferred securities previously issued by Great Southern Capital Trust III at a discount. Also in 2015,\nthe Company sold a banking center building in Nebraska at a net gain of $671,000. In addition, during 2015, the Company recognized a $300,000 gain on the sale of a non-marketable investment. The Company recognized a $257,000 gain on the sale of the Thayer, Mo., branch and deposits during the first quarter of 2016 and a $110,000 gain was recognized on the sale of the Buffalo, Mo., branch and deposits during the first quarter of 2016. In addition, in 2016, a gain of $238,000 was recognized on sales of fixed assets unrelated to the branch sales.\nNon-Interest Expense\nTotal non-interest expense increased $6.0 million, or 5.3%, from $114.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, to $120.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. The Company's efficiency ratio for the year ended December 31, 2016 was 62.86%, slightly higher than the 62.85% in 2015. The 2016 ratio was negatively affected by the increase in non-interest expense and the decrease in net interest income, offset by an increase in non-interest income. The Company's ratio of non-interest expense to average assets decreased from 2.81% for the year ended December 31, 2015, to 2.76% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in the current year ratio was due to the increase in average assets in 2016 compared to 2015, partially offset by the increase in non-interest expense. Average assets for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased $303.4 million, or 7.5%, from the year ended December 31, 2015. The following were key items related to the increase in non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015:\nFifth Third Bank branch acquisition expenses: The Company incurred approximately $1.4 million of expenses during 2016 related to the acquisition of certain branches of Fifth Third Bank, versus approximately $482,000 in acquisition related expenses in the prior year. Those expenses for 2016 (net of prior year expense, if applicable), included approximately $317,000 of legal, audit and other professional fees expense, approximately $294,000 of computer license and support expense, approximately $436,000 in charges to replace former Fifth Third Bank customer checks with Great Southern Bank checks, and approximately $54,000 of travel, meals and other expenses related to the transaction and similar costs incurred during the year. A number of these increases are discussed in the related categories below.\nSalaries and employee benefits: Salaries and employee benefits increased $1.7 million over the prior year period. Salaries increased due to additional employee costs related to the branches acquired from Fifth Third Bank during the first quarter of 2016 ($2.3 million during 2016), which was partially offset by the reduction in expenses related to the 16 banking centers which were closed or sold during the first quarter of 2016 ($1.7 million during the prior year). The remaining increase was due to increased staffing due to growth in lending and other operational areas.\nExpense on foreclosed assets: Expense on foreclosed assets increased $1.6 million compared to the prior year due to expenses and valuation write-downs of foreclosed assets, and the loss on final disposition of certain assets during the current year. During 2016, expenses and loss on final disposition of two related properties totaling $320,000 were incurred. In addition, approximately $912,000 in valuation write-downs, primarily related to these two properties, were taken during 2016. Collection expenses and losses on sales of non-real estate assets (primarily automobiles) increased $652,000 in 2016 compared to 2015. The Company has increased its consumer lending, primarily in indirect automobile lending, significantly in the past few years. The Company does not currently expect significant increases in this type of lending in future periods.\nOther operating expenses: Other operating expenses increased $1.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015. Of this amount, $436,000 relates to check charges to replace Fifth Third customer checks as part of the acquisition in the first quarter of 2016. There was also increased expense due to higher levels of debit card and check fraud losses in 2016. These losses totaled $1.9 million in 2016 compared to $619,000 in 2015. A large portion of the increase related to debit card fraud that resulted from a data security breach at a national retail merchant which operates stores in many of our markets, affecting some of our debit card customers who transacted business with the merchant. The losses incurred by the Company resulted from regulatory requirements that banks reimburse debit card customers for unauthorized transactions. In regard to this particular merchant breach, we currently believe that further loss exposure will not be significant.\nLegal, audit and other professional fees: Legal, audit and other professional fees increased $478,000 from the prior year due to legal and professional fees related to the Fifth Third transaction, legal fees related to the resolution of two large non-performing loan relationships, and increased audit and accounting fees.\nSupplies expense: Supplies expense increased $375,000 compared to the prior year primarily due to approximately $318,000 of one-time costs incurred to stock a supply of chip-enabled debit cards. In October 2016, the Company began mass issuing chip-enabled debit cards to its deposit customer base.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe Company's effective tax rate was 26.7% and 25.1% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which was lower than the statutory federal tax rate of 35%, due primarily to the utilization of certain investment tax credits and to tax-exempt investments and tax-exempt loans which reduced the Company's effective tax rate. In future periods, the Company expects its effective tax rate typically will be 26-28% of pre-tax net income, assuming it continues to maintain or increase its use of investment tax credits and maintain or increase its pre-tax net income. The Company's effective tax rate may fluctuate as it is impacted by the level and timing of the Company's utilization of tax credits and the level of tax-exempt investments and loans and the overall level of pretax income.\nAverage Balances, Interest Rates and Yields\nThe following table presents, for the periods indicated, the total dollar amount of interest income from average interest-earning assets and the resulting yields, as well as the interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities, expressed both in dollars and rates, and the net interest margin. Average balances of loans receivable include the average balances of non-accrual loans for each period. Interest income on loans includes interest received on non-accrual loans on a cash basis. Interest income on loans includes the amortization of net loan fees which were deferred in accordance with accounting standards. Fees included in interest income were $5.0 million, $4.4 million and $3.2 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Tax-exempt income was not calculated on a tax equivalent basis. The table does not reflect any effect of income taxes.\n\n * Defined as the Company's net interest income divided by total interest-earning assets. (1) Of the total average balances of investment securities, average tax-exempt investment securities were $72.0 million, $79.9 million and $87.9 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In addition, average tax-exempt industrial revenue bonds were $32.0 million, $36.1 million and $38.5 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Interest income on tax-exempt assets included in this table was $3.8 million, $4.4 million and $5.2 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Interest income net of disallowed interest expense related to tax-exempt assets was $3.7 million, $4.2 million and $5.0 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. (2) The yield/rate on loans at December 31, 2016 does not include the impact of the accretable yield (income) on loans acquired in the FDIC-assisted transactions. See \"Net Interest Income\" for a discussion of the effect on 2016 results of operations. \nRate/Volume Analysis\nThe following table presents the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for major components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for the periods shown. For each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, information is provided on changes attributable to (i) changes in rate (i.e., changes in rate multiplied by old volume) and (ii) changes in volume (i.e., changes in volume multiplied by old rate). For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately to volume and rate. Tax-exempt income was not calculated on a tax equivalent basis.\n\nResults of Operations and Comparison for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nGeneral\nNet income increased $3.0 million, or 6.8%, during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Net income was $46.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $43.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was due to an increase in net interest income of $793,000, or 0.5% and a decrease in non-interest expense of $6.5 million, or 5.4%, partially offset by an increase in provision for income taxes of $1.8 million, or 13.2%, an increase in the provision for loan losses of $1.4 million, or 33.0% and a decrease in non-interest income of $1.2 million, or 7.8%. Non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2014 included a gain recognized on business acquisition of $10.8 million. Net income available to common shareholders was $45.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $43.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nTotal Interest Income\nTotal interest income increased $989,000, or 0.5%, during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was due to a $4.7 million, or 2.7%, increase in interest income on loans, partially offset by a $3.7 million, or 34.1%, decrease in interest income on investments and other interest-earning assets. Interest income on loans increased in 2015 due to higher average balances on loans, partially offset by lower average rates of interest. Interest income from investment securities and other interest-earning assets decreased during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to lower average balances. The lower average balances of investments were primarily due to the sale of certain mortgage-backed securities, and as a result of management's decision to not reinvest mortgage-backed securities' monthly cash flows and proceeds of sales back into investments, but to utilize the proceeds to fund a portion of our loan growth. Prepayments on the mortgages underlying these securities resulted in amortization of premiums\nwhich also reduced yields. Interest income on loans is affected by variations in the adjustments to accretable yield due to increases in expected cash flows to be received from the FDIC-acquired loan pools as discussed below in \"Interest Income - Loans\" and in Note 4 of the accompanying audited financial statements, which are included in Item 8 of this Report. In 2015, many higher yielding loans matured or were repaid. These loans were replaced with new loans that were generally at rates lower than those that repaid during the year, resulting in lower overall yields in the loan portfolio. Higher average balances of loans more than offset the lower interest yield on loans.\nInterest Income - Loans\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, interest income on loans increased due to higher average balances, partially offset by lower average interest rates. Interest income increased $26.1 million as a result of higher average loan balances which increased from $2.78 billion during the year ended December 31, 2014 to $3.24 billion during the year ended December 31, 2015. The higher average balances were primarily due to increases in commercial construction loans, consumer loans, commercial real estate loans, other residential loans and owner occupied one- to four-family residential loan categories. A portion of this average balance increase resulted from the Company acquiring $165.1 million in loans (net of discounts) as part of the Valley Bank FDIC-assisted transaction on June 20, 2014, the aggregate balance of which was $93.4 million (net of discounts) at December 31, 2015.\nInterest income decreased $21.4 million as the result of lower average interest rates on loans. The average yield on loans decreased from 6.20% during the year ended December 31, 2014 to 5.48% during the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was due to lower overall loan rates, and a lower amount of accretion income in the current year in conjunction with the fair value of the loan pools acquired in the FDIC-assisted transactions, as the additional yield accretion was lower in 2015 compared to 2014. On an on-going basis, the Company estimates the cash flows expected to be collected from the acquired loan pools. This cash flows estimate has increased, based on the payment histories and reduced loss expectations of the loan pools, resulting in adjustments to be spread on a level-yield basis over the remaining expected lives of the loan pools. For the loan pools acquired in the 2009, 2011 and 2012 FDIC-assisted transactions, the increases in expected cash flows also reduced the amount of expected reimbursements under the loss sharing agreements with the FDIC, which are recorded as indemnification assets. Therefore, the expected indemnification assets have also been reduced, resulting in adjustments to be amortized on a comparable basis over the remainder of the loss sharing agreements or the remaining expected life of the loan pools, whichever is shorter. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the adjustments increased interest income by $28.5 million and $35.0 million, respectively, and decreased non-interest income by $19.5 million and $28.7 million, respectively. The net impact to pre-tax income was $9.0 million and $6.2 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. As of December 31, 2015, the remaining accretable yield adjustment that will affect interest income is $12.0 million and the remaining adjustment to the indemnification assets, including the effects of the clawback liability related to InterBank, that will affect non-interest income (expense) is $(8.6) million. Of the remaining adjustments, we expect to recognize $9.1 million of interest income and $(6.0) million of non-interest income (expense) during 2016. Additional adjustments may be recorded in future periods from the FDIC-assisted transactions, as the Company continues to estimate expected cash flows from the acquired loan pools. Apart from the yield accretion, the average yield on loans was 4.60% for the year ended December 31, 2015, down from 4.94% for the year ended December 31, 2014, as a result of loan pay-offs and normal amortization of higher-rate loans and new loans that were made at current lower market rates.\nIn addition, the Company's net interest margin has been positively impacted by additional yield accretion recognized in conjunction with updated estimates of the fair value of the loan pools acquired in the June 2014 Valley Bank FDIC-assisted transaction. Beginning with the three months ended December 31, 2014, the cash flow estimates have increased for certain of the Valley Bank loan pools primarily based on significant loan repayments and also due to collection of certain loans, thereby reducing loss expectations on certain of the loan pools. This resulted in increased income that was spread on a level-yield basis over the remaining expected lives of these loan pools. The Valley Bank transaction does not include a loss sharing agreement with the FDIC. Therefore, there is no related indemnification asset. The entire amount of the discount adjustment will be accreted to interest income over time with no offsetting impact to non-interest income. The amount of the Valley Bank discount adjustment accreted to interest income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $5.7 million, and is included in the impact on net interest income/net interest margin amount discussed above. Based on current estimates, we anticipate recording additional interest income accretion of $3.0 million during 2016 related to these Valley Bank loan pools.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company collected $891,000 from customers on loans which had previously not been expected to be collectible. In accordance with the Company's accounting methodology, these collections were accounted for as increases in estimated cash flows and were recorded as interest income, thereby increasing net interest income and net interest margin. These collections related to acquired loans which were subject to loss sharing agreements with the FDIC; therefore, 80% of the amounts collected, or $713,000, was owed to the FDIC. This $713,000 of expense is included in non-interest income under \"accretion (amortization) of income related to business acquisitions.\"\nInterest Income - Investments and Other Interest-earning Assets\nInterest income on investments decreased $3.4 million as a result of a decrease in average balances from $495.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, to $330.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Average balances of securities decreased due to sales of certain mortgage-backed securities, normal monthly payments received related to the portfolio of mortgage-backed securities, and calls and maturities of maturities of municipal securities. The investment securities were reduced because they were no longer needed for pledging. Interest income on investments decreased $272,000 as a result of a decrease in average interest rates from 2.11% during the year ended December 31, 2014 to 2.06% during the year ended December 31, 2015. The majority of the Company's securities in 2014 and 2015 were mortgage-backed securities which are backed by hybrid ARMs that have fixed rates of interest for a period of time (generally one to ten years) and then adjust annually. The actual amount of securities that reprice and the actual interest rate changes on these securities are subject to the level of prepayments on these securities and the changes that actually occur in market interest rates (primarily treasury rates and LIBOR rates). Mortgage-backed securities are also subject to reduced yields due to more rapid prepayments in the underlying mortgages. As a result, premiums on these securities may be amortized against interest income more quickly, thereby reducing the yield recorded.\nInterest income on other interest-earning assets decreased $62,000 mainly due to lower average balances from $185.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, to $152.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Average balances of interest-earning deposits decreased primarily due to the use of excess liquidity to fund a portion of the Company's loan growth. The Company's interest-earning deposits and non-interest-earning cash equivalents currently earn very low or no yield and therefore negatively impact the Company's net interest margin. At December 31, 2015, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $199.2 million compared to $218.6 million at December 31, 2014. See \"Net Interest Income\" for additional information on the impact of this interest activity.\nTotal Interest Expense\nTotal interest expense increased $196,000, or 1.2%, during the year ended December 31, 2015, when compared with the year ended December 31, 2014, due to an increase in interest expense on deposits of $2.3 million, or 20.4% and an increase in interest expense on subordinated debentures issued to capital trust of $147,000, or 25.9%, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense on FHLBank advances of $1.2 million, or 41.3%, and a decrease in interest expense on short-term and structured repo borrowings of $1.0 million, or 94.1%.\nInterest Expense - Deposits\nInterest on demand deposits decreased $176,000 due to a decrease in average rates from 0.22% during the year ended December 31, 2014, to 0.20% during the year ended December 31, 2015. Interest on demand deposits decreased $54,000 due to a small decrease in average balances from $1.43 billion in the year ended December 31, 2014, to $1.40 billion in the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in average balances of interest-bearing demand deposits was primarily a result of a decrease in public funds deposits. Average noninterest-bearing demand balances increased from $535 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, to $542 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nInterest expense on time deposits increased $1.8 million due to an increase in average balances of time deposits from $1.04 billion during the year ended December 31, 2014, to $1.26 billion during the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in average balances of time deposits was primarily a result of increased balances of brokered deposits and time deposits opened through the Company's internet deposit acquisition channels. The increase in time deposit balances was also due to the deposits acquired in the Valley Bank transaction on June 20, 2014. Interest expense on time deposits increased $741,000 as a result of an increase in average rates of interest from 0.78% during the year ended December 31, 2014, to 0.85% during the year ended December 31, 2015. A large portion of the Company's certificate of deposit portfolio matures within six to eighteen months and therefore reprices fairly quickly; this is consistent with the portfolio over the past several years.\nInterest Expense - FHLBank Advances, Short-term Borrowings and Structured Repurchase Agreements and Subordinated Debentures Issued to Capital Trust\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, interest expense on FHLBank advances decreased due to lower average rates of interest, partially offset by slightly higher average balances. Interest expense on FHLBank advances decreased $1.3 million due to a decrease in average interest rates from 1.69% in the year ended December 31, 2014, to 0.97% in the year ended December 31, 2015. The significant decrease in the average rate was due to the repayment of $80 million of the Company's long-term higher-rate FHLBank advances in June 2014. As of December 31, 2015, $232 million of the Company's $264 million of total FHLBank advances are short-term advances with very low interest rates. Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in interest expense on FHLBank advances of $64,000 due to an increase in average balances from $172.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, to $175.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily due to additional short-term FHLBank advances obtained by the Company during 2015 to fund loan growth and for other short term funding needs.\nInterest expense on short-term and structured repo borrowings decreased $1.1 million due to a decrease in average rates on short-term borrowings from 0.58% in the year ended December 31, 2014, to 0.03% in the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company repaid $50 million of structured repurchase agreements in June 2014. As there were no higher-rate structured repurchase agreements during 2015, the average rate decreased significantly because the interest expense was all related to the lower-rate securities sold under repurchase agreements with customers. Partially offsetting that decrease, interest expense on short-term borrowings and structured repurchase agreements increased $18,000 due to an increase in average balances from $188.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, to $192.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, interest expense on subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts increased $189,000 due to higher average interest rates. The average interest rate was 1.83% in 2014, compared to 2.48% in 2015. The increase in the interest rate resulted from the amortization of the cost of interest rate caps the Company purchased in 2013 to limit the interest rate risk from rising LIBOR rates related to the Company's subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts. Interest expense on subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts decreased $42,000 due to a decrease in average balances from $30.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $28.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The average balance decreased because the Company redeemed $5.0 million of its subordinated debentures issued to capital trust during 2015. Additional information regarding this transaction is provided in Note 13 of the accompanying audited financial statements, which are included in Item 8 of this Report. The remaining debentures are variable-rate debentures which bear interest at an average rate of three-month LIBOR plus 1.60%, adjusting quarterly. The average interest rate will continue to be higher than this until the third quarter of 2017 as a result of the amortization of the cost of the interest rate cap.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $793,000 to $168.4 million compared to $167.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Net interest margin was 4.53% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 4.84% in 2014, a decrease of 31 basis points. The Company's net interest income and margin have been significantly impacted by additional yield accretion recognized in conjunction with updated estimates of the fair value of the loan pools acquired in the 2009, 2011 and 2012 FDIC-assisted transactions. The Company's margin was positively impacted in both years by the increases in expected cash flows to be received from the loan pools acquired in the FDIC-assisted transactions and the resulting increases to accretable yield which was discussed previously in \"Interest Income - Loans\" and is discussed in Note 4 of the accompanying audited financial statements, which are included in Item 8 of this Report. The impact of these changes on the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were increases in interest income of $28.5 million and $35.0 million, respectively, and increases in net interest margin of 77 basis points and 101 basis points, respectively. Excluding the positive impact of the additional yield accretion, net interest margin decreased 7 basis points during the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in net interest margin was primarily due to a decrease in average interest rate on loans and an increase in the average interest rate on time deposits.\nThe Company's overall interest rate spread decreased 30 basis points, or 6.3%, from 4.74% during the year ended December 31, 2014, to 4.44% during the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was due to a 33 basis point decrease in the weighted average yield on interest-earning assets, partially offset by a three basis point decrease in the weighted average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. In comparing the two years, the yield on loans decreased 72 basis points while the yield on investment securities and other interest-earning assets decreased 12 basis points. The rate paid on deposits increased six basis points, the rate paid on FHLBank advances decreased 72 basis points, the rate paid on short-term borrowings decreased 55 basis points and the rate paid on subordinated debentures issued to capital trust increased 65 basis points.\nFor additional information on net interest income components, refer to the \"Average Balances, Interest Rates and Yields\" table in this Report.\nProvision for Loan Losses and Allowance for Loan Losses\nThe provision for loan losses increased $1.4 million to $5.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, when compared with the year ended December 31, 2014. At December 31, 2015, the allowance for loan losses was $38.1 million, a decrease of $286,000 from December 31, 2014. Total net charge-offs were $5.8 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Excluding those related to loans covered by loss sharing agreements, five relationships made up $2.6 million of the total $5.8 million in net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2015. General market conditions and unique circumstances related to individual borrowers and projects also contributed to the level of provisions and charge-offs. As properties were categorized as potential problem loans, non-performing loans or foreclosed assets, evaluations were made of the values of these assets with corresponding charge-offs as appropriate.\nExcept for those loans acquired in the TeamBank and Vantus Bank transactions for which the loss sharing agreements have ended (i.e., non-single family real estate loans), loans acquired in the 2009, 2011 and 2012 FDIC-assisted transactions are covered by loss sharing agreements between the FDIC and Great Southern Bank which afford Great Southern Bank at least 80% protection from losses in the acquired portfolio of loans. The FDIC loss sharing agreements are subject to limitations on the types of losses covered and the length\nof time losses are covered and are conditioned upon the Bank complying with its requirements in the agreements with the FDIC. These limitations are described in detail in Note 4 of the accompanying audited financial statements, which are included in Item 8 of this Report. These acquired loans were grouped into pools based on common characteristics and were recorded at their estimated fair values, which incorporated estimated credit losses at the acquisition dates. These loan pools are systematically reviewed by the Company to determine the risk of losses that may exceed those identified at the time of the acquisition. Techniques used in determining risk of loss are similar to those used to determine the risk of loss for the legacy Great Southern Bank portfolio, with most focus being placed on those loan pools which include the larger loan relationships and those loan pools which exhibit higher risk characteristics. Review of the acquired loan portfolio also includes meetings with customers, review of financial information and collateral valuations to determine if any additional losses are apparent. Former Valley Bank loans, which were also acquired in an FDIC-assisted transaction, are accounted for in pools and were recorded at their fair value at the time of the acquisition as of June 20, 2014; therefore, these loan pools are analyzed rather than the individual loans.\nThe Bank's allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans, excluding loans covered by the FDIC loss sharing agreements, was 1.20% and 1.34% at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover losses inherent in the Company's loan portfolio at December 31, 2015, based on recent reviews of the Company's loan portfolio and current economic conditions. If economic conditions were to deteriorate or management's assessment of the loan portfolio were to change, it is possible that additional loan loss provisions would be required, thereby adversely affecting future results of operations and financial condition.\nNon-performing Assets\nFormer TeamBank, Vantus Bank, Sun Security Bank and InterBank non-performing assets, including foreclosed assets, are not included in the totals or in the discussion of non-performing loans, potential problem loans and foreclosed assets below as they are, or were, subject to loss sharing agreements with the FDIC, which cover at least 80% of principal losses that may be incurred in these portfolios for the applicable terms under the agreements. At December 31, 2015, there were no material non-performing assets that were previously covered, and are now not covered, under the TeamBank or Vantus Bank non-single-family loss sharing agreements. In addition, FDIC-supported TeamBank, Vantus Bank, Sun Security Bank and InterBank assets were initially recorded at their estimated fair values as of their acquisition dates of March 20, 2009, September 4, 2009, October 7, 2011, and April 27, 2012, respectively. The overall performance of the FDIC-covered loan pools acquired in 2009, 2011 and 2012 has been better than original expectations as of the acquisition dates. Former Valley Bank loans are also excluded from the totals and the discussion of non-performing loans, potential problem loans and foreclosed assets below, although they are not covered by a loss sharing agreement.\nThe loss sharing agreement for the non-single-family portion of the loans acquired in the TeamBank transaction ended on March 31, 2014. Any additional losses in that non-single-family portfolio will not be eligible for loss sharing coverage. At this time, the Company does not expect any material losses in this non-single-family loan portfolio, which totaled $16.2 million, net of discounts, at December 31, 2015.\nThe loss sharing agreement for the non-single-family portion of the loans acquired in the Vantus Bank transaction ended on September 30, 2014. Any additional losses in that non-single-family portfolio will not be eligible for loss sharing coverage. At this time, the Company does not expect any material losses in this non-single-family loan portfolio, which totaled $17.1 million, net of discounts, at December 31, 2015.\nAs a result of changes in balances and composition of the loan portfolio, changes in economic and market conditions that occur from time to time, and other factors specific to a borrower's circumstances, the level of non-performing assets will fluctuate.\nNon-performing assets, excluding FDIC-covered non-performing assets and other FDIC-assisted acquired assets, at December 31, 2015, were $44.0 million, an increase of $272,000 from $43.7 million at December 31, 2014. Non-performing assets, excluding FDIC-covered non-performing assets and other FDIC-assisted acquired assets, as a percentage of total assets were 1.07% at December 31, 2015, compared to 1.11% at December 31, 2014.\nCompared to December 31, 2014, non-performing loans increased $8.5 million to $16.6 million at December 31, 2015, and foreclosed assets decreased $8.1 million to $27.4 million at December 31, 2015. Non-performing commercial real estate loans comprised $13.5 million, or 81.4%, of the total of $16.6 million of non-performing loans at December 31, 2015. Non-performing one-to four-family residential loans comprised $1.4 million, or 8.2%, of the total non-performing loans at December 31, 2015. Non-performing consumer loans were $1.3 million, or 7.8%, of total non-performing loans at December 31, 2015. Non-performing commercial business loans were $288,000, or 1.7%, of total non-performing loans at December 31, 2015. Non-performing construction and land development loans were $139,000, or 0.8%, of total non-performing loans at December 31, 2015.\nNon-performing Loans. Activity in the non-performing loans category during the year ended December 31, 2015, was as follows:\n\nAt December 31, 2015, the non-performing commercial real estate category included nine loans, five of which were transferred from potential problem loans during the current year and related to three relationships. The largest relationship in this category, which was transferred from potential problem loans to non-performing loans during the three months ended December 31, 2015, totaled $6.5 million, or 48.1% of the total category, and is collateralized by three operating long-term health care facilities in Missouri. This relationship with the Bank began in 2000 and has performed adequately until recently. A receiver was recently appointed to manage and stabilize the facilities. The second largest relationship in this category, which was also transferred from potential problem loans during the three months ended December 31, 2015, totaled $3.7 million, or 27.6%, of the total category, and is collateralized by property in the Branson, Mo., area, including a lakefront resort, marina and related amenities, condominiums and lots. This borrower has been in business for over 30 years and a bank customer since 1992. In 2015, the project experienced declining occupancy rates and entered bankruptcy in the latter part of 2015. Of the $1.5 million removed from non-performing commercial real estate loans during the year, $1.3 million was related to one loan, and was removed due to improvement in the credit and payment performance. The non-performing one- to four-family residential category included 27 loans, 16 of which were added during the year. The non-performing consumer category included 101 loans, 83 of which were added during the year.\nForeclosed Assets. Of the total $31.9 million of other real estate owned at December 31, 2015, $1.8 million represents the fair value of foreclosed assets covered by FDIC loss sharing agreements, $460,000 represents the fair value of foreclosed assets previously covered by FDIC loss sharing agreements, $995,000 represents foreclosed assets related to Valley Bank and not covered by loss sharing agreements, $25,000 represents other assets related to acquired loans, and $1.2 million represents properties which were not acquired through foreclosure. The foreclosed assets and other assets related to acquired loans and the properties not acquired through foreclosure are not included in the following table and discussion of foreclosed assets. Because sales of foreclosed properties exceeded additions, total foreclosed assets decreased. Activity in foreclosed assets during the year ended December 31, 2015, was as follows:\n\nAt December 31, 2015, the land development category of foreclosed assets included 26 properties, the largest of which was located in northwest Arkansas and had a balance of $1.4 million, or 11.3% of the total category. Of the total dollar amount in the land development category of foreclosed assets, 35.4% and 36.2% was located in northwest Arkansas and in the Branson, Mo., area, respectively, including the $1.4 million property previously mentioned. Of the $5.0 million in proceeds from sales in the category, $2.9 million related to the sale of six properties, which included one property located in northwest Arkansas which was sold during the three months ended December 31, 2015, totaling $1.2 million. In addition, two properties totaling $1.6 million in the Branson, Mo., area were sold, two properties in northwest Arkansas totaling $1.3 million were sold and one property in southwest Missouri totaling $585,000 was sold. The subdivision construction category of foreclosed assets included 25 properties, the largest of which was located in the Springfield, Mo. metropolitan area and had a balance of $1.2 million, or 17.6% of the total category. Of the total dollar amount in the subdivision construction category of foreclosed assets, 32.2% and 17.6% is located in Branson, Mo. and Springfield, Mo., respectively. Of the $2.4 million in sales in this category, $2.3 million was from the sale of two properties. One subdivision property totaling $1.3 million in the Kansas City, Mo. metropolitan area was sold and one subdivision property in the St. Louis, Mo. metropolitan area totaling $931,000 was sold. The commercial real estate category of foreclosed assets included eight properties, three of which were related to the same borrower. The largest property in the commercial real estate category of foreclosed assets, which was located in southeast Missouri and was added during the three months ended March 31, 2015, totaled $2.0 million, or 56.0% of the total category. The other residential category of foreclosed assets included 11 properties, 10 of which were all part of the same condominium community, which was located in Branson, Mo. and had a balance of $1.8 million, or 83.7% of the total category. The one-to four-family residential category of foreclosed assets included seven properties, of which the largest relationship, with two properties in the southwest Missouri area, had a balance of $554,000, or 40.3% of the total category. Of the total dollar amount in the one-to- four-family category of foreclosed assets, 38.2% is located in Branson, Mo.\nPotential Problem Loans. Potential problem loans decreased $12.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, from $25.0 million at December 31, 2014 to $12.8 million at December 31, 2015. This decrease was due to $11.2 million in loans transferred to the non-performing category, $8.6 million in loans removed from potential problem loans due to improvements in the credits, $2.0 million in charge-offs, $157,000 in loans transferred to foreclosed assets, and $2.6 million in payments on potential problem loans, partially offset by the addition of $12.3 million of loans to potential problem loans. Potential problem loans are loans which management has identified through routine internal review procedures as having possible credit problems that may cause the borrowers difficulty in complying with current repayment terms. These loans are not reflected in non-performing assets, but are considered in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Activity in the potential problem loans category during the year ended December 31, 2015, was as follows:\n\nAt December 31, 2015, the commercial real estate category of potential problem loans included 10 loans, seven of which were added during the current year. The largest relationship in this category, which was made up of five new loans added during the three months ended December 31, 2015, had a balance of $2.9 million, or 55.7% of the total category and is collateralized by various properties in the Branson, Mo., area., including commercial buildings, commercial land, residential lots and undeveloped land with clubhouse amenities and entertainment attractions. This relationship has been with the Bank for over 30 years. Of the $10.7 million of transfers to non-performing, $10.2 million were related to two relationships, which were discussed above in the non-performing loans section. All of the net charge-offs in the commercial real estate category related to these two relationships. The land development category of potential problem loans included one loan, which was added during a previous year and is collateralized by property in the Branson, Mo., area. The other residential category of potential problem loans included one loan which was added in a previous year, and is collateralized by properties located in the Branson, Mo., area. This loan was also to the same borrower that was referenced above in the land development category. The one- to four-family residential category of potential problem loans included 12 loans, two of which were added during the current year. The subdivision construction category of potential problem loans included three loans, two of which were added during the current year. Seven loans in this category were removed from potential problem loans during 2015, which included four loans to one borrower totaling $1.6 million. The loans were removed due to improvements in the credit and payment performance. The one-to four-family construction category of potential problem loans is zero at December 31, 2015, and three loans in this category, all of which were to the same borrower, were removed from potential problem loans during the year due to improvement in the borrower's financial performance. These loans were also to the same borrower that was referenced above in the loans which were removed from potential problem loans in the subdivision construction category.\nNon-Interest Income\nNon-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $13.6 million compared with $14.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease of $1.1 million, or 7.8%, was primarily the result of the following increases and decreases:\nInitial gain recognized on business acquisition: In 2014, the Company recognized a one-time gain of $10.8 million (pre-tax) on the FDIC-assisted acquisition of Valley Bank, which occurred on June 20, 2014.\nExcluding the gain referenced above, non-interest income increased $9.7 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily as a result of the following items:\nAmortization of income related to business acquisitions: The net amortization expense related to business acquisitions was $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $27.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2015, consisted of the following items: $18.0 million of amortization expense related to the changes in cash flows expected to be collected from the FDIC-covered loan portfolios and $1.6 million of amortization of the clawback liability. In addition, the Company collected amounts on various problem assets acquired from the FDIC totaling $892,000. Under the loss sharing agreements, 80% of these collected amounts must be remitted to the FDIC; therefore, the Company recorded a liability and related expense of $714,000. Partially offsetting the expense was income from the accretion of the discount related to the\nindemnification assets for the Sun Security Bank and InterBank acquisitions of $1.4 million. In addition, a charge-off on a loan pool which exceeded the remaining discount on the pool by $803,000 was recognized as a reduction to allowance for loan losses during the third quarter. The Bank expects to collect 80% of this amount as reimbursement from the FDIC, so income of $643,000 was recorded in non-interest income.\nService charges and ATM fees: Service charges and ATM fees increased $766,000 compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase in fee income from the additional accounts acquired in the Valley Bank transaction in June 2014.\nOther income: Other income increased $744,000 compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to a $1.1 million gain recognized when the Company redeemed the trust preferred securities previously issued by Great Southern Capital Trust III at a discount, as discussed in previous filings. This increase was offset by non-recurring debit card-related income of $1.0 million recognized during the 2014 period which was not repeated in the 2015 period. Other income increased $300,000 compared to the prior year due to a $300,000 gain recognized on the sale of a non-marketable investment.\nLate charges and fees on loans: Late charges and fees on loans increased $729,000 compared to the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to yield maintenance penalty payments received on 12 commercial loan prepayments, totaling $547,000 in 2015.\nNet realized gains on sales of available-for-sale securities: Gains on sales of available-for-sale securities decreased $2.1 million compared to the prior year. This was primarily due to the sale of securities in the prior year, which was not repeated in 2015. During 2014, the taxable municipal securities originally acquired in the Sun Security Bank acquisition were sold resulting in a gain of $1.2 million. All of the Company's Small Business Administration securities were sold in 2014, which produced a gain of $569,000. In addition, all of the mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations acquired in the Valley Bank acquisition were sold in 2014, and several additional securities were sold later in 2014, producing a gain of $227,000, and one municipal bond was sold at a gain of $95,000.\nNon-Interest Expense\nTotal non-interest expense decreased $6.5 million, or 5.4%, from $120.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, to $114.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company's efficiency ratio for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 62.85%, improving from 66.30% in 2014. The 2015 ratio was positively affected by the decrease in non-interest expense and the increase in net interest income, partially offset by a decrease in non-interest income. The Company's ratio of non-interest expense to average assets decreased from 3.16% for the year ended December 31, 2014, to 2.81% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in the current year ratio was primarily due to both the increase in average assets and the decrease in non-interest expense in 2015 compared to 2014. Average assets for the year ended December 31, 2015, increased $242.9 million, or 6.4%, from the year ended December 31, 2014. The following were key items related to the increase in non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014:\nOther Operating Expenses: Other operating expenses decreased $7.3 million, to $8.5 million, in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year primarily due to $7.4 million in prepayment penalties paid in 2014 as the Company elected to repay $130 million of its FHLB advances and structured repo borrowings prior to their maturity, which was not repeated in 2015.\nExpense on foreclosed assets: Expense on foreclosed assets decreased $3.1 million compared to the prior year primarily due to valuation write-downs of foreclosed assets during 2014 totaling $2.0 million. In addition, total foreclosed assets decreased from the prior year, further reducing the expenses.\nLegal, audit and other professional fees: Legal, audit and other professional fees decreased $1.2 million when compared to the prior year, primarily due to additional expenses in the prior year related to the Valley Bank acquisition, significant collection costs of a few large loans and foreclosed assets, as well as the reduction of the total amount of foreclosed assets in the current year compared to the prior year.\nPartially offsetting the decrease in non-interest expense was an increase in the following items:\nExpenses related to operations of new banking centers in 2015: The Company incurred approximately $245,000 and $144,000 of additional non-interest expenses during the year ended December 31, 2015, in connection with the operations of new banking centers in Overland Park, Kansas and Columbia, Missouri, respectively. The majority of these expenses related to salary and benefits and occupancy expenses.\nSalaries and employee benefits: Salaries and employee benefits increased $2.7 million over the prior year, primarily due to increased staffing due to growth in lending and other operational areas, as well as approximately $330,000 in retention payments and other acquisition-related salaries and benefits related to the Fifth Third Bank branch acquisition. In addition, the Company opened banking\ncenters in 2015 in Overland Park, Kansas and Columbia, Missouri, and operated the acquired Valley Bank for a full year in 2015 versus one-half year of operations in 2014.\nNet occupancy expense: Net occupancy expense increased $2.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014. In September 2015, the Company announced plans to consolidate operations of 16 banking centers into other nearby Great Southern banking center locations. The Company evaluated the carrying value of the affected premises (totaling approximately $7.5 million) to determine if any impairment of the value of these premises is warranted and has recorded a valuation allowance of $1.2 million related to certain affected premises, furniture, fixtures and equipment and leases in 2015. Occupancy expense also increased in 2015 as a result of the Valley Bank acquisition which occurred in June 2014, and due to the opening of the two branches in Overland Park and Columbia noted above.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nIn 2014, the Company elected to early-adopt FASB ASU No. 2014-01, which amends FASB ASC Topic 323, Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures. This Update impacted the Company's accounting for investments in flow-through limited liability entities which manage or invest in affordable housing projects that qualify for the low-income housing tax credit. The amendments in the Update permitted reporting entities to make an accounting policy election to account for their investments in qualified affordable housing projects using the proportional amortization method if certain conditions are met. Under the proportional amortization method, an entity amortizes the initial cost of the investment in proportion to the tax credits and other tax benefits received and recognizes the net investment performance in the income statement as a component of income tax expense (benefit). The Company has significant investments in such qualified affordable housing projects that meet the required conditions. The Company's adoption of this Update did not materially affect the Company's financial position or results of operations. There was no change in Net Income for the periods covered in this document and there was no cumulative effect adjustment to Retained Earnings.\nProvision for income taxes as a percentage of pre-tax income was 25.1% and 24.0% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which was lower than the statutory federal tax rate of 35%, due primarily to the effects of the tax credits utilized and to tax-exempt investments and tax-exempt loans which reduced the Company's effective tax rate. In future periods, the Company expects its effective tax rate typically will be 24-26% of pre-tax net income, assuming it continues to maintain or increase its use of investment tax credits. The Company's effective tax rate may fluctuate as it is impacted by the level and timing of the Company's utilization of tax credits and the level of tax-exempt investments and loans and the overall level of pretax income. At this time, the Company expects to continue to utilize a significant amount of tax credits in 2016.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity is a measure of the Company's ability to generate sufficient cash to meet present and future financial obligations in a timely manner through either the sale or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds through liability management. These obligations include the credit needs of customers, funding deposit withdrawals and the day-to-day operations of the Company. Liquid assets include cash, interest-bearing deposits with financial institutions and certain investment securities and loans. As a result of the Company's management of the ability to generate liquidity primarily through liability funding, management believes that the Company maintains overall liquidity sufficient to satisfy its depositors' requirements and meet its customers' credit needs. At December 31, 2016, the Company had commitments of approximately $142.0 million to fund loan originations, $781.8 million of unused lines of credit and unadvanced loans, and $26.4 million of outstanding letters of credit.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's fixed and determinable contractual obligations by payment date as of December 31, 2016. Additional information regarding these contractual obligations is discussed further in Notes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17 and 20 of the accompanying audited financial statements, which are included in Item 8 of this Report.\n\nThe Company's primary sources of funds are customer deposits, FHLBank advances, other borrowings, loan repayments, unpledged securities, proceeds from sales of loans and available-for-sale securities and funds provided from operations. The Company utilizes particular sources of funds based on the comparative costs and availability at the time. The Company has from time to time chosen not to pay rates on deposits as high as the rates paid by certain of its competitors and, when believed to be appropriate, supplements deposits with less expensive alternative sources of funds.\nAt December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had these available secured lines and on-balance sheet liquidity:\n\nStatements of Cash Flows. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company had positive cash flows from operating activities. The Company experienced negative cash flows from investing activities during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, and positive cash flows from investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2014. The Company experienced positive cash flows from financing activities during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, and negative cash flows from financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nCash flows from operating activities for the periods covered by the Statements of Cash Flows have been primarily related to changes in accrued and deferred assets, credits and other liabilities, the provision for loan losses, realized gains on the sale of investment securities and loans, depreciation and amortization, gains on the purchase of additional business units and the amortization of deferred loan origination fees and discounts (premiums) on loans and investments, all of which are non-cash or non-operating adjustments to operating cash flows. Net income adjusted for non-cash and non-operating items and the origination and sale of loans held-for-sale were the primary sources of cash flows from operating activities. Operating activities provided cash flows of $80.1 million, $71.4 million and $67.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, investing activities used cash of $198.1 million and $196.2 million, respectively, primarily due to the net increases and purchases of loans, partially offset by the net repayment or sales of investment securities. During the year ended December 31, 2014, investing activities provided cash of $35.9 million, primarily due to the cash received from the FDIC-assisted acquisitions and the net repayment or sales of investment securities, partially offset by increases in loans.\nChanges in cash flows from financing activities during the periods covered by the Statements of Cash Flows are primarily due to changes in deposits after interest credited, changes in FHLBank advances, changes in short-term borrowings and structured repurchase\nagreements, dividend payments to stockholders, issuance of subordinated notes (2016) and redemption of preferred stock (2015). Financing activities provided cash flows of $198.7 million and $105.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily due to increases in customer deposit balances, partially offset by net increases or decreases in various borrowings, dividend payments to stockholders, issuance of subordinated notes and redemption of preferred stock. Financing activities used cash flows of $112.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to reduction of customer deposit balances, net increases or decreases in various borrowings and dividend payments to stockholders.\nCapital Resources\nManagement continuously reviews the capital position of the Company and the Bank to ensure compliance with minimum regulatory requirements, as well as to explore ways to increase capital either by retained earnings or other means.\nAs of December 31, 2016, total stockholders' equity and common stockholders' equity were $429.8 million, or 9.4% of total assets, equivalent to a book value of $30.77 per common share. As of December 31, 2015, total stockholders' equity and common stockholders' equity were $398.2 million, or 9.7% of total assets, equivalent to a book value of $28.67 per common share. At December 31, 2016, the Company's tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 9.2% as compared to 9.6% at December 31, 2015.\nBanks are required to maintain minimum risk-based capital ratios. These ratios compare capital, as defined by the risk-based regulations, to assets adjusted for their relative risk as defined by the regulations. Under current guidelines, which became effective January 1, 2015, banks must have a minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.50%, a minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.00%, a minimum total risk-based capital ratio of 8.00%, and a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.00%. To be considered \"well capitalized,\" banks must have a minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.50%, a minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.00%, a minimum total risk-based capital ratio of 10.00%, and a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5.00%. On December 31, 2016, the Bank's common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.8%, its Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.8%, its total capital ratio was 12.7% and its Tier 1 leverage ratio was 10.8%. As a result, as of December 31, 2016, the Bank was well capitalized, with capital ratios in excess of those required to qualify as such. On December 31, 2015, the Bank's common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.0%, its Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.0%, its total capital ratio was 12.1% and its Tier 1 leverage ratio was 9.8%. As a result, as of December 31, 2015, the Bank was well capitalized, with capital ratios in excess of those required to qualify as such.\nThe FRB has established capital regulations for bank holding companies that generally parallel the capital regulations for banks. On December 31, 2016, the Company's common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 10.2%, its Tier 1 capital ratio was 10.8%, its total capital ratio was 13.6% and its Tier 1 leverage ratio was 9.9%. To be considered well capitalized, a bank holding company must have a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.00% and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.00%. As of December 31, 2016, the Company was considered well capitalized, with capital ratios in excess of those required to qualify as such. On December 31, 2015, the Company's common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 10.8%, its Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.5%, its total capital ratio was 12.6% and its Tier 1 leverage ratio was 10.2%. To be considered well capitalized, a bank holding company must have a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.00% and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.00%. As of December 31, 2015, the Company was considered well capitalized, with capital ratios in excess of those required to qualify as such.\nIn addition to the minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and total risk-based capital ratio, the Company and the Bank will have to maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional common equity Tier 1 capital greater than 2.5% of risk-weighted assets above the required minimum levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, repurchasing shares, and paying discretionary bonuses. The new capital conservation buffer requirement began phasing in beginning on January 1, 2016 when a buffer greater than 0.625% of risk-weighted assets was required, which amount will increase an equal amount each year until the buffer requirement of greater than 2.5% of risk-weighted assets is fully implemented on January 1, 2019.\nOn August 18, 2011, the Company entered into a Small Business Lending Fund-Securities Purchase Agreement (\"Purchase Agreement\") with the Secretary of the Treasury, pursuant to which the Company sold 57,943 shares of the Company's Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A (the \"SBLF Preferred Stock\") to the Secretary of the Treasury for a purchase price of $57.9 million. The SBLF Preferred Stock was issued pursuant to Treasury's SBLF program, a $30 billion fund established under the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 that was created to encourage lending to small businesses by providing Tier 1 capital to qualified community banks and holding companies with assets of less than $10 billion. As required by the SBLF Purchase Agreement, the proceeds from the sale of the SBLF Preferred Stock were used in connection with the redemption of all 58,000 shares of the Company's preferred stock, issued to Treasury in December 2008 pursuant to Treasury's TARP Capital Purchase Program (the \"CPP\"). The shares of CPP Preferred Stock were redeemed at their liquidation amount of $1,000 per share plus the accrued but unpaid dividends to the redemption date.\nThe SBLF Preferred Stock qualified as Tier 1 capital. The holders of SBLF Preferred Stock were entitled to receive noncumulative dividends, payable quarterly, on each January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1. The dividend rate, as a percentage of the liquidation\namount, could fluctuate between one percent (1%) and five percent (5%) per annum on a quarterly basis during the first 10 quarters during which the SBLF Preferred Stock was outstanding, based upon changes in the level of \"Qualified Small Business Lending\" or \"QSBL\" (as defined in the SBLF Purchase Agreement) by the Bank over the adjusted baseline level calculated under the terms of the SBLF Preferred Stock $(249.7 million). Based upon the increase in the Bank's level of QSBL over the adjusted baseline level, the dividend rate had been 1.0%. For the tenth calendar quarter through four and one-half years after issuance, the dividend rate was fixed at one percent (1%) based upon the level of qualifying loans. After four and one half years from issuance, the dividend rate would have increased to 9% (including a quarterly lending incentive fee of 0.5%).\nOn December 15, 2015, the Company (with the approval of its federal banking regulator) redeemed all 57,943 shares of the SBLF Preferred Stock at their liquidation amount of $1,000 per share plus accrued but unpaid dividends to the redemption date. The redemption of the SBLF Preferred Stock was completed using internally available funds.\nDividends. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company declared common stock cash dividends of $0.88 per share (27.4% of net income per common share) and paid common stock cash dividends of $0.88 per share. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company declared common stock cash dividends of $0.86 per share (26.2% of net income per common share) and paid common stock cash dividends of $0.84 per share. The Board of Directors meets regularly to consider the level and the timing of dividend payments. The $0.22 per share dividend declared but unpaid as of December 31, 2016, was paid to stockholders on January 13, 2017. In addition, the Company paid preferred dividends as described below in years prior to 2016.\nWhile the SBLF Preferred Stock was outstanding, the terms of the SBLF Preferred Stock limited the ability of the Company to pay dividends and repurchase shares of common stock. Under the terms of the SBLF Preferred Stock, no repurchases could be effected, and no dividends could be declared or paid on preferred shares ranking pari passu with the SBLF Preferred Stock, junior preferred shares, or other junior securities (including the common stock) during the current quarter and for the next three quarters following the failure to declare and pay dividends on the SBLF Preferred Stock, except that, in any such quarter in which the dividend is paid, dividend payments on shares ranking pari passu may be paid to the extent necessary to avoid any resulting material covenant breach.\nUnder the terms of the SBLF Preferred Stock, the Company could only declare and pay a dividend on the common stock or other stock junior to the SBLF Preferred Stock, or repurchase shares of any such class or series of stock, if, after payment of such dividend, or after giving effect to such repurchase, (i) the dollar amount of the Company's Tier 1 Capital would be at least equal to the \"Tier 1 Dividend Threshold\" and (ii) full dividends on all outstanding shares of SBLF Preferred Stock for the most recently completed dividend period have been or are contemporaneously declared and paid. We satisfied this condition through the redemption date of the SBLF Preferred Stock.\nCommon Stock Repurchases and Issuances. The Company has been in various buy-back programs since May 1990. Our ability to repurchase common stock was limited, but allowed, under the terms of the SBLF preferred stock as noted above, under \"-Dividends\" and was previously generally precluded due to our participation in the CPP from December 2008 through August 2011. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company issued 80,454 shares of stock at an average price of $26.47 per share and 133,126 shares of stock at an average price of $25.26 per share, respectively, to cover stock option exercises.\nManagement has historically utilized stock buy-back programs from time to time as long as management believed that repurchasing the stock would contribute to the overall growth of shareholder value. The number of shares of stock that will be repurchased at any particular time and the prices that will be paid are subject to many factors, several of which are outside of the control of the Company. The primary factors, however, are the number of shares available in the market from sellers at any given time, the price of the stock within the market as determined by the market and the projected impact on the Company's earnings per share and capital.", "item_7_tables": "Table 95: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Beginning\nBalance,\nJanuary 1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>
