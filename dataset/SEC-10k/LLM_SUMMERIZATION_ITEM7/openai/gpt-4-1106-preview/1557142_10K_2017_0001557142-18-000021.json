Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and related notes appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery, development and commercialization of small molecules and biologics to address significant unmet medical needs. We are developing product candidates within inflammatory and fibrotic diseases, as well as, genetic diseases. Our team, which has a proven track record of successful drug development and commercialization, identifies and develops novel candidates from our small molecule and biologics platforms as well as develops our in-licensed product candidates. By retaining global commercial rights to our lead product candidates, we believe that we have the ability to progress these candidates ourselves while maintaining flexibility for commercial and licensing arrangements. We expect to continue to progress our clinical candidates and have clinical trial data to report throughout 2018.\nOur operations to date have been focused on developing first-in-class innovative therapies for indications with significant unmet medical needs while leveraging our commercial infrastructure. We have never been profitable and had an accumulated deficit of $237.4 million at December 31, 2017. Our net losses were $79.8 million, $208.8 million and $147.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Although our commercial business generates revenue, we expect to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect these losses to increase as we continue our development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our additional product candidates, hire additional personnel and initiate commercialization of any products that receive regulatory approval. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if, or as, we:\nTable 290: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ninvest significantly to further develop our most advanced product candidates, including KD025, tesevatinib and KD034;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 291: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ninitiate additional clinical trials and preclinical studies for our other product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 292: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nseek regulatory approval for our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 293: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncontinue to invest in our ROCK inhibitors and other research platforms;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 294: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nseek to identify additional product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 295: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nscale up our sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure and product sourcing capabilities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 296: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nacquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 297: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nscale up our operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 298: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nmake milestone or other payments under any in-license agreements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 299: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nmaintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 300: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\noperate as a public company.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn July 26, 2016, prior to the closing of our IPO we completed a corporate conversion transaction whereby we converted from a Delaware limited liability company into a Delaware corporation and changed our name to Kadmon Holdings, Inc., which we refer to herein as the Corporate Conversion.\u201d As required by the Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of Kadmon Holdings, LLC, the Corporate Conversion was approved by our board of directors. In connection with the Corporate Conversion, holders of our outstanding units received one share of common stock for every 6.5 membership units held immediately prior to the Corporate Conversion, and options and warrants to purchase units became options and warrants to purchase one share of common stock for each unit underlying such options or warrants immediately prior to the Corporate Conversion, at the same aggregate exercise price in effect prior to the Corporate Conversion.\nComponents of Statement of Operations\nRevenue\nOur revenue is substantially derived from sales of our portfolio of products, including our ribavirin portfolio of products and to a lesser extent sales of tetrabenazine and valganciclovir. No meaningful revenue has been generated from sales of our other products. Revenue also includes the recognition of upfront licensing fees and milestone payments received primarily under our license agreement with AbbVie.\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales consists of product costs, including ingredient costs and costs of contract manufacturers for production, and shipping and handling of the products. Also included are costs related to quality release testing and stability testing of the products. Other costs included in cost of sales are packaging costs, warehousing costs and certain allocated costs related to management, facilities and other expenses associated with supply chain logistics.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the development of our product candidates, which include:\nTable 301: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nlicense fees related to our license and collaboration agreements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 302: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nresearch and development-based employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and other compensation expenses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 303: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nexpenses incurred under our agreements with contract research organizations that conduct nonclinical and preclinical studies, and clinical sites and consultants that conduct our clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 304: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncosts associated with regulatory filings;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 305: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncosts of laboratory supplies and the acquisition, development and manufacture of preclinical and clinical study materials and study drugs; and/or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 306: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nallocated facility-related expenses.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur research and development expenses may vary substantially from period to period based on the timing of our research and development activities, including due to timing of initiation of clinical trials and enrollment of patients in clinical trials. We do not allocate personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation, costs associated with broad technology platform improvements and other indirect costs to specific product candidates. We do not allocate these costs to specific product candidates because they are deployed across multiple overlapping projects under development, making it difficult to specifically and accurately allocate such costs to a particular product candidate.\nThe successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain and subject to numerous risks including, but not limited to:\nTable 307: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe scope, rate of progress and expense of our research and development activities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 308: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nclinical trial results;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 309: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe scope, terms and timing of regulatory approvals;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 310: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe expense of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 311: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe cost, timing and our ability to acquire sufficient clinical and commercial supplies for any product candidates and products that we may develop; and/or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 312: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe risks disclosed in the section entitled Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nA change in the outcome of any of these variables could mean a significant change in the expenses and timing associated with the development of any product candidate.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for non-research personnel, including stock-based compensation and travel expenses for our employees in executive, operational, finance, legal, commercial, regulatory, pharmacovigilance and human resource functions. Other selling, general and administrative expenses include facility-related costs, commercial royalty expense and director compensation, accounting and legal services, consulting costs and programs and marketing costs to support the commercial business.\nOther income (expense)\nOther income (expense) is comprised of interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and interest expense on our outstanding indebtedness, including paid-in-kind interest on our convertible debt and non-cash interest related to the write-off and amortization of debt discount debt premium and deferred financing costs associated with our indebtedness. Our loss on equity method investment in MeiraGTx, as well as, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value of our financial instruments are recognized in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations. Such financial instruments include a success fee and warrant liabilities for which the exercise price was contingent on our per share price in a qualified public offering. The change in fair value is based upon the fair value of the underlying security at the end of each reporting period, as calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, in the case of certain warrant liabilities and the success fee, and a binomial model, in the case of certain warrant liabilities.\nIn addition, we operate in currencies other than the U.S. dollar to fund research and development and commercial activities performed by various third-party vendors. The translation of these currencies into U.S. dollars results in foreign currency gains or losses, depending on the change in value of these currencies against the U.S. dollar. These gains and losses are included in other income (expense).\nIncome taxes\nPrior to the Corporate Conversion, we were a limited liability company but taxed as a C corporation for federal and state tax purposes. On July 26, 2016, we converted from a limited liability company to a Delaware corporation pursuant to a statutory conversion. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had a deferred tax liability of $0.9 million and $1.4 million, respectively, and a full valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets. We experienced ownership changes under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 in 2010, 2011 and 2016, which limits our ability to utilize net operating loss carry-forwards. We did not reduce the gross deferred tax assets related to the net operating loss carry-forwards, however, because the limitations do not hinder our ability to potentially utilize all of the net operating loss carry-forwards\nAs of December 31, 2017, we have unused federal and state net operating loss carry-forwards of $419.2 million and $362.0 million, respectively, that may be applied against future taxable income. These carry-forwards expire at various dates through December 31, 2037. We recorded a valuation allowance to fully offset the gross deferred tax asset, because it is more likely than not that we will not realize future benefits associated with these deferred tax assets at December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nManagement's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reporting amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to intangible assets and goodwill, derivative liabilities, unit-based compensation and accrued expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nShare-based compensation expense\nPrior to our IPO, we were a privately held company with no active public market for our Class A units. Therefore, our management had estimated the fair value of our Class A units at various dates considering our most recently available third-party valuations of Class A units and management's assessment of additional objective and highly subjective factors that it believed were relevant. The consummation of our IPO on August 1, 2016 established a public trading market for shares of our common stock; therefore it is no longer necessary for management to estimate the fair value of our equity in connection with our accounting for granted stock options. In the absence of a public trading market for shares of our common stock, we applied the fair value recognition provisions of FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation.\u201d ASC 718 requires all unit-based payments to employees and directors, including unit option grants and modifications to existing unit options, to be recognized in the statements of operations based on their fair values. We recognize compensation expense over the period during which the recipient renders the required services using the straight-line, single option method.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2016, we adopted ASU 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation.\u201d ASU 2016-09 requires that certain amendments relevant to us be applied using a modified-retrospective transition method by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to accumulated deficit as of the beginning of the period in which the guidance is adopted. As a result of adopting ASU 2016-09 during the three months ended December 31, 2016, we adjusted accumulated deficit for amendments related to an entity-wide accounting policy election to recognize share-based award forfeitures only as they occur rather than estimate a forfeiture rate. We recorded a $2.0 million charge to accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2016 and an associated credit to additional paid-in capital for previously unrecognized stock compensation expense as a result of applying this policy election. Upon the election, we also recorded $0.8 million in additional share-based compensation expense related to the nine months ended September 30, 2016 in the quarter ended December 31, 2016.\nASU 2016-09 also requires the recognition of the income tax effects of awards in the consolidated statement of operations when the awards vest or are settled, thus eliminating addition paid-in capital pools. We elected to adopt the amendments related to the presentation of excess tax benefits on the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows using a prospective transition method.\nAs there had been no public market for our Class A units prior to our IPO, the estimated fair value of our Class A units had been determined contemporaneously by our board of directors utilizing independent third-party valuations prepared in accordance with the guidance outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, also known as the Practice Aid for financial reporting purposes. We performed contemporaneous valuations of our Class A units concurrently with the achievement of significant milestones or with major financing events as of October 31, 2014 ($39.00) and September 30, 2015 ($32.50). In conducting these valuation analyses, we considered all objective and subjective factors that we believed to be relevant for each valuation conducted, including:\nTable 313: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nrecent equity financings and the related valuations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 314: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nindustry information such as market size and growth;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 315: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nmarket capitalization of comparable companies and the estimated value of transactions such companies have engaged in; and/or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 316: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nmacroeconomic conditions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn July 13, 2016, the compensation committee of our board of directors approved an option award for Dr. Harlan W. Waksal, increasing the number of options (giving effect to the Corporate Conversion) subject to his original option grant. The number of shares subject to this option award was equal to the difference between the 769,231 options originally granted to Dr. Harlan W. Waksal and 5% of our outstanding common equity determined on a fully diluted basis on the IPO date, which amounted to 1,630,536 options. The effective date of the new option award was the IPO date of July 26, 2016. The exercise price per share of common stock subject to the new incremental options awarded was equal to the price per share of common stock at the IPO date of $12.00. The option award is subject to the same vesting schedule applicable to the original option grant such that all options awarded will vest on August 4, 2017. In consideration for the new option award, Dr. Harlan W. Waksal has committed to perform an additional year of service through August 4, 2018 in connection with receipt of the additional option shares. In the event Dr. Harlan W. Waksal voluntarily terminates his employment prior to completion of this additional year of service, Dr. Harlan W. Waksal shall forfeit 25% of the additional options, or 25% of the aggregate additional option gain associated with the additional option shares in the event the options are exercised, as applicable. This modification resulted in a $12.4 million charge, of which the incremental value of the previously vested portion of the awards totaling $8.3 million was expensed during the third quarter of 2016 and the remaining amount of the unvested portion totaling $4.1 million will be recognized over the remaining service period through August 4, 2018.\n\ufeff\nThe assumptions relating to the valuation

The vesting schedule of such awards was not amended. The amendment to the option awards resulted in a modification charge of $1.1 million, of which $0.7 million was expensed immediately during the first quarter of 2015 and the remaining amount is being recognized over the vesting periods of each award, which range from one to two years.\nOn July 13, 2016, the compensation committee of our board of directors approved the amendment of all outstanding option awards issued under our 2011 Equity Incentive Plan whereby, effective upon pricing of our IPO, the exercise price (on a post-Corporate Conversion, post-split basis) was adjusted to equal the price per share of our common stock in the IPO. Options to purchase an aggregate of approximately 1.6 million shares of our Class A units were modified. The vesting schedule of such awards was not modified. The modification resulted in a $4.0 million charge, of which the incremental value of the previously vested portion of the awards totaling $1.8 million was expensed immediately during the third quarter of 2016 and the remaining $2.2 million will be recognized over the remaining vesting periods of each award. These vesting periods range from one to three years.\nA total of 9,750 units were granted under the LTIP at December 31, 2017 and 2016. The compensation expense for these awards was recognized upon consummation of our IPO on August 1, 2016 and was recorded as additional paid in capital. No compensation expense had been recorded prior to this date. We utilized a Monte-Carlo simulation to determine the fair value of the awards granted under the LTIP of $22.6 million, which was recorded during the third quarter of 2016 as these awards are not forfeitable. The LTIP is payable upon the fair market value of our common stock exceeding 333% of the $6.00 grant price ($20.00) per share prior to December 7, 2024. The holders of the LTIP have no right to demand a particular form of payment, and we reserve the right to make payment in the form of cash or common stock.\nWe granted 1,040,000 stock appreciation rights to three executive employees on December 8, 2017. No stock appreciation rights were granted under the 2016 Equity Plan prior to 2017. The weighted-average fair value of the stock appreciation rights granted to the three executive officers was $2.42 and was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: risk-free interest rate of 2.22%, expected term of 6 years, expected volatility of 74.92%, share price of $3.64, strike price of $3.64 and a dividend rate of 0%.\nCompensation expense for stock appreciation rights is recognized on a straight-line basis over the awards' requisite service period. At December 31, 2017, there was $2.5 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock appreciation rights. The unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.9 years. No stock appreciation rights were exercised during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 3 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d of the notes to our

approximately $13.9 million, from $26.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to $12.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in total revenue was primarily attributable to the decline in sales of our ribavirin portfolio products. Total revenue includes a $2.0 million milestone payment earned pursuant to a license agreement entered into with Jinghua to develop products using human monoclonal antibodies for each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. We recognized previously deferred revenue from our license and collaboration agreements amounting to $4.4 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Service revenue from our affiliate MeiraGTx Limited (MeiraGTx) was $0.6 million and $1.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nInternational product sales represented approximately 26.9% and 8.6% of total product sales for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, the majority of which were sales in the Netherlands and Ireland.\nSales from our ribavirin portfolio continued to decline in 2017, from $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as the treatment landscape for chronic HCV infection has rapidly evolved, with multiple ribavirin-free treatment regimens, including novel direct-acting antivirals, having entered the market and becoming the new standard of care. As a result, we expect sales of our ribavirin portfolio of products to contribute insignificantly to revenue in 2018 and beyond.\nWe recognized revenue of $1.0 million and $0.6 million from sales of tetrabenazine during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We recognized revenue of $0.2 million and $0.9 million from sales of valganciclovir during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. No meaningful revenue was generated from sales of our other products for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nCost of sales\nCost of sales was $1.3 million and $3.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which relates primarily to the sales volume of our ribavirin portfolio of products.\nWrite-down of inventory\nWe recognized $1.7 million and $0.4 million of inventory write-downs during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, of our Ribasphere inventory based on our expectation that such inventory will not be sold prior to reaching its product expiration date.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses increased by 14.0%, or approximately $4.9 million, to $40.8 million, including $2.7 million of non-cash items, for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $35.8 million, including $3.0 million of non-cash items, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in research and development expense was primarily related to direct external costs of developing our product candidates across multiple projects. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recognized $7.6 million and $4.8 million, respectively, in development expenses for tesevatinib; $5.5 million and $2.2 million, respectively, for KD025; $1.0 million and $1.6 million, respectively, for KD034; $6.8 million and $1.4 million, respectively, for other product candidates; and $19.8 million and $25.8 million, respectively, was related to unallocated internal and external costs of developing our product candidates across multiple projects.\nIn June 2016, research and development expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses were revised to conform to the current presentation with regard to our method of allocating a portion of facility-related expenses to research and development expenses to more accurately reflect the effort spent on research and development. We reclassified $2.2 million from selling, general and administrative expense to research and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 65.0%, or approximately $68.9 million, to $37.1 million, including $11.5 million of non-cash items, for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $105.9 million, including $69.1 million of non-cash items, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses is primarily related to a decrease in share-based compensation of $34.6 million, of which $22.0 million is related to the LTIP, $1.8 million is related to the repricing of employee options, $8.3 million is related to an option grant to our Chief Executive Officer and $2.5 million is related to lower share-based compensation for employee options, as well as, a decrease of $3.0 million in severance expense primarily related to the separation agreement with Dr. Samuel D. Waksal, salary and salary-related expenses of $5.6 million related to a reduction in headcount, legal expense of $4.1 million primarily related to legal settlements entered into during 2016, amortization of intangible assets of $15.2 million due to the intangible asset being fully amortized at December 31, 2016, royalty expense of $1.0 million and consulting fees of $3.0 million resulting from the expiration of an advisory agreement entered into in April 2015.\nGain on settlement of payable\nGain on settlement of payable is primarily related to a gain of $3.9 million resulting from the mutual termination agreement entered into with Valeant during the first quarter of 2016.\nOther expense\nThe following table provides components of other expense:\n\ufeff\nTable 323: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nYears Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>3,720 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>3,782 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense - beneficial conversion feature\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>45,915 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest paid-in-kind\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>14,695 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWrite-off of deferred financing costs and debt discount\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>3,820 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAmortization of deferred financing costs and debt discount\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2,242 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>4,422 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>11,176 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nChange in fair value of financial instruments\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(2,096) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(4,380) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLoss on equity method investment\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>7,599 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>13,625 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther income\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(126) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(46) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther expense\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>11,339 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>93,009 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, other expense consisted primarily of interest expense and other costs related to our debt of $6.0 million and a loss on equity method investment in MeiraGTx of $7.6 million, partially offset by a change in the fair value of financial instruments of $2.1 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, other expense consisted primarily of interest expense and other costs related to our debt of $72.6 million, a loss on extinguishment of debt of $11.2 million related to the exchange agreements dated as of June 8, 2016 and a loss on equity method investment in MeiraGTx of $13.6 million, partially offset by a change in the fair value of financial instruments of $4.4 million.\nIncome taxes\nHistorically we were a limited liability company taxed as a C corporation for federal and state tax purposes. On July 26, 2016, we effected the Corporate Conversion whereby we converted from a Delaware limited liability company to a Delaware corporation pursuant to a statutory conversion. We recorded an income tax benefit of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 related to a $0.4 million adjustment to the deferred tax liability, net of $0.3 million of income tax expense related to a $2.0 million milestone payment received from Jinghua. We recorded income tax expense of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, related to a $2.0 million milestone payment received from Jinghua.\nDeemed Dividend\nWe calculated a deemed dividend on the Class E redeemable convertible units of $13.4 million in August 2016, which equaled a 15% discount to the price per share of our common stock of $12.00 in the IPO upon conversion to common stock at our IPO due to a beneficial conversion feature. The Class E redeemable convertible units converted into common stock at our IPO resulting in no Class E redeemable convertible units outstanding at both December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nAt our IPO, we issued 30,000 shares of convertible preferred stock which accrues dividends at a rate of 5% and converts into shares of our common stock at a 20% discount to the price per share of our common stock of $12.00 in the IPO. We calculated a deemed dividend on the convertible preferred stock of $7.5 million in August 2016, which equals the 20% discount to the price per share of our common stock in the IPO of $12.00, a beneficial conversion feature. We also accrued dividends on the convertible preferred stock of $1.5 million and $0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Approximately $1.4 million of accrued dividends that were payable on June 30, 2017 was added to the stated liquidation preference amount of the 5% convertible preferred stock, which totaled $31.4 million at December 31, 2017.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nRevenues\nTotal revenue decreased by 26.9%, or approximately $9.6 million, to $26.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $35.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was mostly attributable to the decline in sales of our ribavirin portfolio products. The decrease in total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was partially offset by a $2.0 million milestone payment earned pursuant to a license agreement entered into with Jinghua to develop products using human monoclonal antibodies. We recognized previously deferred revenue from our license and collaboration agreements amounting to $4.4 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Service revenue from our affiliate MeiraGTx Limited (MeiraGTx) was $1.0 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nInternational product sales represented approximately 8.6% and 10.0% of total product sales for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, the majority of which were sales in Netherlands and Germany.\nSales from our ribavirin portfolio continued to decline in 2016, from $29.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. We recognized revenue of $0.6 million from sales of tetrabenazine during the year ended December 31, 2016. No revenue was generated from sales of tetrabenazine in 2015. We recognized revenue of $0.9 million from sales of valganciclovir during the year ended December 31, 2016. No revenue was generated from sales of valganciclovir in 2015. No meaningful revenue was generated from sales of our other products for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nCost of sales\nCost of sales decreased by 5.4%, or approximately $0.2 million, to $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was a direct result of lower sales of our ribavirin portfolio of products.\nWrite-down of inventory\nWe recognized $0.4 million and $2.3 million of inventory write-downs during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, of our Ribasphere inventory based on our expectation that such inventory will not be sold prior to reaching its product expiration date.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses increased by 6.6%, or approximately $2.2 million, to $35.8 million, including $3.0 million of non-cash items, for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $33.6 million, including $2.2 million of non-cash items, for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in research and development expense was primarily related to unallocated internal and external costs of developing our product candidates across multiple projects. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recognized $4.8 million and $4.6 million, respectively, in development expenses for tesevatinib; $2.2 million and $3.0 million, respectively, for KD025; $1.6 million and $1.0 million, respectively, for KD034; $1.4 million and $2.5 million, respectively, for other product candidates; and $25.8 million and $22.5 million, respectively, was related to unallocated internal and external costs of developing our product candidates across multiple projects.\nIn June 2016, research and development expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses were revised to conform to the current presentation with regard to our method of allocating a portion of facility-related expenses to research and development expenses to more accurately reflect the effort spent on research and development. We reclassified $2.2 million and $3.9 million from selling, general and administrative expense to research and development expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n\ufeff\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by 1.1%, or approximately $1.2 million, to $105.9 million, including $69.1 million of non-cash items, for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $104.7 million, including $61.8 million of non-cash items, for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses is primarily related to an increase in share-based compensation of $36.9 million, of which $22.0 million is related to the LTIP, $3.6 million is related to the repricing of employee options, $9.3 million is related to an option grant to our Chief Executive Officer, and $3.0 million is related to an increase in severance expense primarily related to the separation agreement with Dr. Samuel D. Waksal. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in salary and salary-related expenses of $3.7 million related to a reduction in headcount, legal expense of $17.6 million related to legal settlements entered into during 2015, amortization of intangible assets of $12.2 million due to a change to proportional performance method of amortization starting October 1, 2015, royalty expense of $1.5 million and consulting fees of $3.0 million resulting from the expiration of an advisory agreement entered into in April 2015.\nImpairment loss on intangible asset\nIn September 2015, we reviewed the estimated useful life of the Ribasphere product rights and determined that the actual life of the Ribasphere product rights intangible asset was shorter than the estimated useful life used for amortization purposes in our financial statements due to hepatitis C market conditions. As a result, effective September 30, 2015, we changed the estimate of the useful life of our Ribasphere product rights intangible asset to 1.25 years to better reflect the estimated period during which the asset will generate cash flows. We also determined that the estimated fair value of the Ribasphere product rights was impaired and recorded an impairment loss of $31.3 million in September 2015.\nGain on settlement of payable\nGain on settlement of payable is primarily related to a gain of $3.9 million resulting from the mutual termination agreement entered into with Valeant during the first quarter of 2016.\n\ufeff\nOther expense\nThe following table provides components of other expense:\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 324: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nYears Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>3,782 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>7,817 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense - beneficial conversion feature\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>45,915 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest paid-in-kind\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>14,695 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>11,434 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWrite-off of deferred financing costs and debt discount\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>3,820 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2,752 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAmortization of deferred financing costs and debt discount\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>4,422 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>5,157 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>11,176 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2,934 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nChange in fair value of financial instruments\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(4,380) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(1,494) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGain on deconsolidation of subsidiary\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(24,000) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLoss on equity method investment\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>13,625 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2,776 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther income\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(46) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(144) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther expense\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>93,009 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>7,232 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, other expense consisted primarily of interest expense and other costs related to our debt of $72.6 million, a loss on extinguishment of debt of $11.2 million related to the exchange agreements dated as of June 8, 2016, loss on equity method investment in MeiraGTx of $13.6 million and a change in the fair value of financial instruments of $4.4 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, other expense consisted primarily of interest expense and other costs related to our debt of $27.2 million, a loss on extinguishment of debt of $2.9 million related to an amendment to our Senior Convertible Term Loan and a loss on equity method investment in MeiraGTx of $2.8 million, partially offset by a $24.0 million gain recognized upon the deconsolidation of MeiraGTx and a change in the fair value of financial instruments of $1.5 million.\nIncome taxes\nHistorically we were a limited liability company taxed as a C corporation for federal and state tax purposes. On July 26, 2016, we effected the Corporate Conversion whereby we converted from a Delaware limited liability company to a Delaware corporation pursuant to a statutory conversion. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded income tax expense of $0.3 million related to the $2.0 million milestone payment received from Jinghua. No income tax expense was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nDeemed Dividend\nWe calculated a deemed dividend on the Class E redeemable convertible units of $13.4 million in August 2016, which equaled a 15% discount to the price per share of our common stock of $12.00 in the IPO upon conversion to common stock at our IPO due to a beneficial conversion feature. The Class E redeemable convertible units converted into common stock at our IPO resulting in no Class E redeemable convertible units outstanding at December 31, 2016.\nAt our IPO, we issued 30,000 shares of convertible preferred stock which accrues dividends at a rate of 5% and converts into shares of our common stock at a 20% discount to the price per share of our common stock of $12.00 in the IPO. We calculated a deemed dividend on the convertible preferred stock of $7.5 million in August 2016, which equals the 20% discount to the price per share of our common stock in the IPO of $12.00, a beneficial conversion feature. We also accrued dividends on the convertible preferred stock of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our financial results determined in accordance with GAAP, we have also disclosed in the tables below non-GAAP adjusted earnings and non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. These financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude beneficial conversion features and deemed dividends recorded in connection with our IPO and Corporate Conversion (comprehensively Adjustment Items). In addition, from time to time in the future there may be other items that we may exclude for the purposes of our non-GAAP financial measures; likewise, we may in the future cease to exclude items that we have historically excluded for the purpose of our non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating\nresults because they exclude amounts that management and the board of directors do not consider part of core operating results or that are non-recurring when assessing the performance of the organization. We believe that inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency and comparability with past reports of financial results and provides consistency in calculations by outside analysts reviewing our results. Accordingly, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency of supplemental information used by management.\nWe believe that non-GAAP financial measures are helpful in understanding our past financial performance and potential future results, but there are limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting and may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation between companies. Adjustment items that are excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures can have a material impact on net earnings. As a result, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, net loss and its components, earnings per share, or other measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measure. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nReconciliation of GAAP net loss to non-GAAP adjusted earnings are as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 325: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(unaudited)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nReported GAAP net loss attributable to common stockholders\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(81,692) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(230,488) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(147,082) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense - beneficial conversion feature (1)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>45,915 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDeemed dividends (2)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>20,931 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNon-GAAP adjusted net loss attributable to common stockholders\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(81,692) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(163,642) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(147,082) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nReported GAAP basic and diluted net loss per share of common stock\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(1.42) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(9.74) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(18.10) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nImpact of Adjustment Items\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2.82 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNon-GAAP adjusted basic and diluted net loss per share of common stock\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(1.42) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(6.92) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(18.10) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWeighted average basic and diluted shares of common stock outstanding\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>57,405,331 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>23,674,512 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>8,127,781 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nTable 326: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTo exclude the beneficial conversion feature of our debt upon conversion into shares of our common stock on August 1, 2016.

We expect that our research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses will continue to increase as we develop our product candidates. As a result, we will need additional capital to fund our operations, which we may raise through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, other third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. As set forth in the 2015 Credit Agreement, which matures on June 17, 2018, we are required to comply with certain financial covenants and to satisfy a clinical development milestone by December 31, 2017. The clinical development milestone was deemed satisfied in a letter agreement entered into on December 22, 2017 with a majority of lenders under our 2015 Credit Agreement. The 2015 Credit Agreement also required us to raise $17.0 million of capital by December 31, 2017 (the amount remaining under a covenant to raise $40.0 million following previous rounds of financing), which was satisfied in September 2017. At December 31, 2017, we had $67.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2.1 million in restricted cash pursuant to leases for our facilities located in New York, New York, and Cambridge, Massachusetts. Our existing cash is expected to continue to enable us to advance our planned Phase 2 clinical studies for KD025 and tesevatinib and advance certain of our other pipeline product candidates.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP, which contemplate our continuation as a going concern. We have not established a source of revenues sufficient to cover our operating costs, and as such, have been dependent on funding operations through the issuance of debt and sale of equity securities. We expect to incur further losses over the next several years as we develop our business. Further, at December 31, 2017, we had working capital of $13.4 million. Our accumulated deficit amounted to $237.4 million and $155.7 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Net cash used in operating activities was $64.1 million, $53.0 million and $61.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nWe anticipate that we will need to raise additional capital to fund our continued operations. We may not be successful in our efforts to raise additional funds or achieve profitable operations. Amounts raised will be used for further development of our product candidates, to provide financing for marketing and promotion, to secure additional property and equipment, and for other working capital purposes. Even if we are able to raise additional funds through the sale of our equity securities, or loans from financial institutions, our cash needs could be greater than anticipated in which case we could be forced to raise additional capital.\nIn September 2017, we raised $80.4 million in gross proceeds, $75.1 million net of $5.3 million in underwriting fees, commissions and other offering costs and expenses, from the issuance of 26,775,000 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 10,710,000 shares of common stock at an initial exercise price of $3.35 per share for a term of 5 years from the date of issuance at a combined price of $3.001 per share and accompanying warrant. Gross proceeds of $66.8 million closed in September 2017 and the remaining $13.6 million of gross proceeds closed in October 2017. In March 2017, we raised $22.7 million in gross proceeds, $20.9 million net of placement agent fees and other offering costs and expenses, from the issuance of 6,767,855 shares of our common stock, at a price of $3.36 per share, and warrants to purchase 2,707,138 shares of our common stock at an initial exercise price of $4.50 per share and a term of 13 months from the date of issuance. In connection with the offering, we had agreed to file a registration statement to register the shares of common stock and the shares of common stock underlying the warrants for resale. Under the agreement, the registration statement had to be filed within 30 days of the closing of the financing and declared effective within the timeline provided in the agreement. If the applicable deadlines were not met, monthly liquidated damages of 2.0% of the subscription amount (with an 8.0% cap) were due to the purchaser. The registration statement was filed on April 10, 2017 and declared effective on April 21, 2017.\nAt the present time, we have no commitments for any additional financing, and there can be no assurance that, if needed, additional capital will be available to us on commercially acceptable terms or at all. If we cannot obtain the needed capital, we may not be able to become profitable and may have to curtail or cease our operations. These and other factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm's Report issued in connection with our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 stated that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\u201d The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments or classifications that may result from the possible inability of us to continue as a going concern.\nSources of Liquidity\nSince our inception through December 31, 2017, we have raised net proceeds from the issuance of equity and debt. At December 31, 2017, we had $34.6 million of outstanding loans under the 2015 Credit Agreement. The Senior Convertible\nTerm Loan and Second-Lien Convert were mandatorily converted into shares of our common stock at a conversion price equal to 80% of the IPO price per share of common stock in our IPO, or $9.60 per share.\nPursuant to the Third Amendment, principal payments owed under the 2015 Credit Agreement, in the amount of $380,000 per month, were deferred until January 31, 2018. Additionally, the parties amended a future capital raising covenant by extending the time period by which we were required to raise the remaining $17.0 million of capital by six months, from June 30, 2017 to December 31, 2017, which was achieved in September 2017. The warrants issued under the 2015 Credit Agreement were amended so that the exercise price was reduced from $10.20 per warrant to $4.50 per warrant and the cashless exercise feature of the warrant was removed in its entirety requiring the holder to pay cash to exercise the warrant. All other material terms of the 2015 Credit Agreement, including the maturity date, remain the same. As of the date hereof, we are not in default under the terms of the 2015 Credit Agreement. See Note 7, Debt\u201d of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.\nThe following table sets forth the primary sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents for each period set forth below:\nTable 328: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating activities\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(64,098) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(52,950) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(60,977) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInvesting activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(479) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(539) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(161) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFinancing activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>96,001 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>68,084 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>61,645 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>31,424 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>14,595 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>507 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nOperating Activities\nThe net cash used in operating activities was $64.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, and consisted primarily of a net loss of $79.8 million adjusted for $23.2 million in non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization of fixed assets of $1.8 million, write-down of inventory of $1.7 million, amortization of deferred financing costs, debt discount, and debt premium of $2.2 million, loss on equity method investment of $7.6 million and share-based compensation expense of $12.4 million, as well as, a net decrease in operating assets and liabilities of $7.5 million.

Net cash used in investing activities was $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 consisting of costs related to the purchase of property and equipment, primarily related to in-house software purchased to support our internal clinical data management group.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $96.0 million, consisting primarily of proceeds from the issuance of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock in our public offering of $75.1 million, net of underwriting fees, commissions and other offering costs and expenses and proceeds from the issuance of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock in our private placement of $20.9 million, net of placement agent fees and other offering costs and expenses.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $68.1 million, consisting primarily of proceeds from the issuance of common stock in our IPO of $69.8 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions, and net proceeds from the issuance of Class E redeemable convertible units of $5.5 million, partially offset by payment of offerings costs of $3.3 million and repayment of the related party loan of $3.0 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $61.6 million, consisting of proceeds from the issuance of secured term debt of $35.0 million, proceeds from the issuance of convertible debt of $112.5 million, net proceeds from the issuance of Class A membership units of $15.0 million and net proceeds from the issuance of Class E redeemable convertible units of $10.8 million, partially offset by the repayment of senior secured term debt of $107.2 million and payment of financing costs of $4.1 million.\nFuture Funding Requirements\nWe expect our expenses to increase compared to prior periods in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue research and development, continue and initiate clinical trials and seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates. In anticipation of regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant pre-commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing.\nThe expected use of our cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2017 represents our intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could change in the future as our plans and business conditions evolve. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including the progress of our development, the status of, and results from, clinical trials, the potential need to conduct additional clinical trials to obtain approval of our product candidates for all intended indications, as well as any additional collaborations that we may enter into with third parties for our product candidates and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of our existing cash and cash equivalents. In addition, we anticipate the need to raise additional funds from the issuance of additional equity, and our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of those funds as well.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2017:\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 329: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nPayments due by period (in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nLess than\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nMore than\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n1 - 3 years\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n3 - 5 years\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSecured term debt\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>34,620 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>34,620 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense(1)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,653 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,653 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating leases(2)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>33,463 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>4,579 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>8,566 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>8,434 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>11,884 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal(3)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>69,736 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>40,852 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>8,566 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>8,434 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>11,884 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\n_________________________\nTable 330: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nInterest expense reflects our obligation to make cash interest payments in connection with our 2015 Credit Agreement at a rate of 10.375%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 331: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOperating lease obligations primarily reflect our obligation to make payments in connection with leases for our corporate headquarters and commercial headquarters distribution center.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 332: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThis table does not include: (a) milestone payments totaling $400.4 million which may become payable to third parties under license agreements as the timing and likelihood of such payments are not known with certainty; (b) any royalty payments to third parties as the amounts, timing and likelihood of such payments are not known with certainty; and (c) contracts that are entered into in the ordinary course of business which are not material in the aggregate in any period presented above.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-balance Sheet Arrangements\nDuring the periods presented we did not have, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under the SEC rules.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and related notes appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery, development and commercialization of small molecules and biologics to address significant unmet medical needs. We are developing product candidates within inflammatory and fibrotic diseases, as well as, genetic diseases. Our team, which has a proven track record of successful drug development and commercialization, identifies and develops novel candidates from our small molecule and biologics platforms as well as develops our in-licensed product candidates. By retaining global commercial rights to our lead product candidates, we believe that we have the ability to progress these candidates ourselves while maintaining flexibility for commercial and licensing arrangements. We expect to continue to progress our clinical candidates and have clinical trial data to report throughout 2018.\nOur operations to date have been focused on developing first-in-class innovative therapies for indications with significant unmet medical needs while leveraging our commercial infrastructure. We have never been profitable and had an accumulated deficit of $237.4 million at December 31, 2017. Our net losses were $79.8 million, $208.8 million and $147.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Although our commercial business generates revenue, we expect to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect these losses to increase as we continue our development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our additional product candidates, hire additional personnel and initiate commercialization of any products that receive regulatory approval. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if, or as, we:\n \u00b7 invest significantly to further develop our most advanced product candidates, including KD025, tesevatinib and KD034; \n \u00b7 initiate additional clinical trials and preclinical studies for our other product candidates; \n \u00b7 seek regulatory approval for our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials; \n \u00b7 continue to invest in our ROCK inhibitors and other research platforms; \n \u00b7 seek to identify additional product candidates; \n \u00b7 scale up our sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure and product sourcing capabilities; \n \u00b7 acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies; \n \u00b7 scale up our operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development; \n \u00b7 make milestone or other payments under any in-license agreements; \n \u00b7 maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; or \n \u00b7 operate as a public company. \nOn July 26, 2016, prior to the closing of our IPO we completed a corporate conversion transaction whereby we converted from a Delaware limited liability company into a Delaware corporation and changed our name to Kadmon Holdings, Inc., which we refer to herein as the Corporate Conversion.\u201d As required by the Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of Kadmon Holdings, LLC, the Corporate Conversion was approved by our board of directors. In connection with the Corporate Conversion, holders of our outstanding units received one share of common stock for every 6.5 membership units held immediately prior to the Corporate Conversion, and options and warrants to purchase units became options and warrants to purchase one share of common stock for each unit underlying such options or warrants immediately prior to the Corporate Conversion, at the same aggregate exercise price in effect prior to the Corporate Conversion.\nComponents of Statement of Operations\nRevenue\nOur revenue is substantially derived from sales of our portfolio of products, including our ribavirin portfolio of products and to a lesser extent sales of tetrabenazine and valganciclovir. No meaningful revenue has been generated from sales of our other products. Revenue also includes the recognition of upfront licensing fees and milestone payments received primarily under our license agreement with AbbVie.\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales consists of product costs, including ingredient costs and costs of contract manufacturers for production, and shipping and handling of the products. Also included are costs related to quality release testing and stability testing of the products. Other costs included in cost of sales are packaging costs, warehousing costs and certain allocated costs related to management, facilities and other expenses associated with supply chain logistics.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the development of our product candidates, which include:\n \u00b7 license fees related to our license and collaboration agreements; \n \u00b7 research and development-based employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and other compensation expenses; \n \u00b7 expenses incurred under our agreements with contract research organizations that conduct nonclinical and preclinical studies, and clinical sites and consultants that conduct our clinical trials; \n \u00b7 costs associated with regulatory filings; \n \u00b7 costs of laboratory supplies and the acquisition, development and manufacture of preclinical and clinical study materials and study drugs; and/or \n \u00b7 allocated facility-related expenses. \nOur research and development expenses may vary substantially from period to period based on the timing of our research and development activities, including due to timing of initiation of clinical trials and enrollment of patients in clinical trials. We do not allocate personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation, costs associated with broad technology platform improvements and other indirect costs to specific product candidates. We do not allocate these costs to specific product candidates because they are deployed across multiple overlapping projects under development, making it difficult to specifically and accurately allocate such costs to a particular product candidate.\nThe successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain and subject to numerous risks including, but not limited to:\n \u00b7 the scope, rate of progress and expense of our research and development activities; \n \u00b7 clinical trial results; \n \u00b7 the scope, terms and timing of regulatory approvals; \n \u00b7 the expense of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights; \n \u00b7 the cost, timing and our ability to acquire sufficient clinical and commercial supplies for any product candidates and products that we may develop; and/or \n \u00b7 the risks disclosed in the section entitled Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nA change in the outcome of any of these variables could mean a significant change in the expenses and timing associated with the development of any product candidate.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for non-research personnel, including stock-based compensation and travel expenses for our employees in executive, operational, finance, legal, commercial, regulatory, pharmacovigilance and human resource functions. Other selling, general and administrative expenses include facility-related costs, commercial royalty expense and director compensation, accounting and legal services, consulting costs and programs and marketing costs to support the commercial business.\nOther income (expense)\nOther income (expense) is comprised of interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and interest expense on our outstanding indebtedness, including paid-in-kind interest on our convertible debt and non-cash interest related to the write-off and amortization of debt discount debt premium and deferred financing costs associated with our indebtedness. Our loss on equity method investment in MeiraGTx, as well as, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value of our financial instruments are recognized in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations. Such financial instruments include a success fee and warrant liabilities for which the exercise price was contingent on our per share price in a qualified public offering. The change in fair value is based upon the fair value of the underlying security at the end of each reporting period, as calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, in the case of certain warrant liabilities and the success fee, and a binomial model, in the case of certain warrant liabilities.\nIn addition, we operate in currencies other than the U.S. dollar to fund research and development and commercial activities performed by various third-party vendors. The translation of these currencies into U.S. dollars results in foreign currency gains or losses, depending on the change in value of these currencies against the U.S. dollar. These gains and losses are included in other income (expense).\nIncome taxes\nPrior to the Corporate Conversion, we were a limited liability company but taxed as a C corporation for federal and state tax purposes. On July 26, 2016, we converted from a limited liability company to a Delaware corporation pursuant to a statutory conversion. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had a deferred tax liability of $0.9 million and $1.4 million, respectively, and a full valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets. We experienced ownership changes under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 in 2010, 2011 and 2016, which limits our ability to utilize net operating loss carry-forwards. We did not reduce the gross deferred tax assets related to the net operating loss carry-forwards, however, because the limitations do not hinder our ability to potentially utilize all of the net operating loss carry-forwards\nAs of December 31, 2017, we have unused federal and state net operating loss carry-forwards of $419.2 million and $362.0 million, respectively, that may be applied against future taxable income. These carry-forwards expire at various dates through December 31, 2037. We recorded a valuation allowance to fully offset the gross deferred tax asset, because it is more likely than not that we will not realize future benefits associated with these deferred tax assets at December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nManagement's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reporting amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to intangible assets and goodwill, derivative liabilities, unit-based compensation and accrued expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nShare-based compensation expense\nPrior to our IPO, we were a privately held company with no active public market for our Class A units. Therefore, our management had estimated the fair value of our Class A units at various dates considering our most recently available third-party valuations of Class A units and management's assessment of additional objective and highly subjective factors that it believed were relevant. The consummation of our IPO on August 1, 2016 established a public trading market for shares of our common stock; therefore it is no longer necessary for management to estimate the fair value of our equity in connection with our accounting for granted stock options. In the absence of a public trading market for shares of our common stock, we applied the fair value recognition provisions of FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation.\u201d ASC 718 requires all unit-based payments to employees and directors, including unit option grants and modifications to existing unit options, to be recognized in the statements of operations based on their fair values. We recognize compensation expense over the period during which the recipient renders the required services using the straight-line, single option method.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2016, we adopted ASU 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation.\u201d ASU 2016-09 requires that certain amendments relevant to us be applied using a modified-retrospective transition method by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to accumulated deficit as of the beginning of the period in which the guidance is adopted. As a result of adopting ASU 2016-09 during the three months ended December 31, 2016, we adjusted accumulated deficit for amendments related to an entity-wide accounting policy election to recognize share-based award forfeitures only as they occur rather than estimate a forfeiture rate. We recorded a $2.0 million charge to accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2016 and an associated credit to additional paid-in capital for previously unrecognized stock compensation expense as a result of applying this policy election. Upon the election, we also recorded $0.8 million in additional share-based compensation expense related to the nine months ended September 30, 2016 in the quarter ended December 31, 2016.\nASU 2016-09 also requires the recognition of the income tax effects of awards in the consolidated statement of operations when the awards vest or are settled, thus eliminating addition paid-in capital pools. We elected to adopt the amendments related to the presentation of excess tax benefits on the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows using a prospective transition method.\nAs there had been no public market for our Class A units prior to our IPO, the estimated fair value of our Class A units had been determined contemporaneously by our board of directors utilizing independent third-party valuations prepared in accordance with the guidance outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, also known as the Practice Aid for financial reporting purposes. We performed contemporaneous valuations of our Class A units concurrently with the achievement of significant milestones or with major financing events as of October 31, 2014 ($39.00) and September 30, 2015 ($32.50). In conducting these valuation analyses, we considered all objective and subjective factors that we believed to be relevant for each valuation conducted, including:\n \u00b7 recent equity financings and the related valuations; \n \u00b7 industry information such as market size and growth; \n \u00b7 market capitalization of comparable companies and the estimated value of transactions such companies have engaged in; and/or \n \u00b7 macroeconomic conditions. \nOn July 13, 2016, the compensation committee of our board of directors approved an option award for Dr. Harlan W. Waksal, increasing the number of options (giving effect to the Corporate Conversion) subject to his original option grant. The number of shares subject to this option award was equal to the difference between the 769,231 options originally granted to Dr. Harlan W. Waksal and 5% of our outstanding common equity determined on a fully diluted basis on the IPO date, which amounted to 1,630,536 options. The effective date of the new option award was the IPO date of July 26, 2016. The exercise price per share of common stock subject to the new incremental options awarded was equal to the price per share of common stock at the IPO date of $12.00. The option award is subject to the same vesting schedule applicable to the original option grant such that all options awarded will vest on August 4, 2017. In consideration for the new option award, Dr. Harlan W. Waksal has committed to perform an additional year of service through August 4, 2018 in connection with receipt of the additional option shares. In the event Dr. Harlan W. Waksal voluntarily terminates his employment prior to completion of this additional year of service, Dr. Harlan W. Waksal shall forfeit 25% of the additional options, or 25% of the aggregate additional option gain associated with the additional option shares in the event the options are exercised, as applicable. This modification resulted in a $12.4 million charge, of which the incremental value of the previously vested portion of the awards totaling $8.3 million was expensed during the third quarter of 2016 and the remaining amount of the unvested portion totaling $4.1 million will be recognized over the remaining service period through August 4, 2018.\n\ufeff\nThe assumptions relating to the valuation

of $39.00 per unit calculated in the valuation as of October 31, 2014 reasonably reflected the per unit fair value of Class A membership units as of the grant date. \n (2) In December 2014, our board of directors approved an option grant to the Chief Executive Officer when the fair value of our Class A membership units was $39.00 per unit calculated in the valuation as of October 31, 2014. The option grant was not issued until December 31, 2015, however, management determined that the exercise price should be the fair value of our Class A membership units when the grant was approved by our board of directors in December 2014 of $39.00 per unit. \n (3) At the time of the option grants on December 31, 2015, management determined that the fair value of our Class A membership units of $32.50 per unit calculated in the valuation as of September 30, 2015 reasonably reflected the per unit fair value of Class A membership units as of the grant date. \nIn January 2015, the compensation committee of our board of directors approved the amendments of all outstanding option awards under the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan with an exercise price above $39.00 per unit to reduce the exercise price of such options to $39.00 per unit, the estimated fair value of our Class A membership units as of October 31, 2014. The vesting schedule of such awards was not amended. The amendment to the option awards resulted in a modification charge of $1.1 million, of which $0.7 million was expensed immediately during the first quarter of 2015 and the remaining amount is being recognized over the vesting periods of each award, which range from one to two years.\nOn July 13, 2016, the compensation committee of our board of directors approved the amendment of all outstanding option awards issued under our 2011 Equity Incentive Plan whereby, effective upon pricing of our IPO, the exercise price (on a post-Corporate Conversion, post-split basis) was adjusted to equal the price per share of our common stock in the IPO. Options to purchase an aggregate of approximately 1.6 million shares of our Class A units were modified. The vesting schedule of such awards was not modified. The modification resulted in a $4.0 million charge, of which the incremental value of the previously vested portion of the awards totaling $1.8 million was expensed immediately during the third quarter of 2016 and the remaining $2.2 million will be recognized over the remaining vesting periods of each award. These vesting periods range from one to three years.\nA total of 9,750 units were granted under the LTIP at December 31, 2017 and 2016. The compensation expense for these awards was recognized upon consummation of our IPO on August 1, 2016 and was recorded as additional paid in capital. No compensation expense had been recorded prior to this date. We utilized a Monte-Carlo simulation to determine the fair value of the awards granted under the LTIP of $22.6 million, which was recorded during the third quarter of 2016 as these awards are not forfeitable. The LTIP is payable upon the fair market value of our common stock exceeding 333% of the $6.00 grant price ($20.00) per share prior to December 7, 2024. The holders of the LTIP have no right to demand a particular form of payment, and we reserve the right to make payment in the form of cash or common stock.\nWe granted 1,040,000 stock appreciation rights to three executive employees on December 8, 2017. No stock appreciation rights were granted under the 2016 Equity Plan prior to 2017. The weighted-average fair value of the stock appreciation rights granted to the three executive officers was $2.42 and was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: risk-free interest rate of 2.22%, expected term of 6 years, expected volatility of 74.92%, share price of $3.64, strike price of $3.64 and a dividend rate of 0%.\nCompensation expense for stock appreciation rights is recognized on a straight-line basis over the awards' requisite service period. At December 31, 2017, there was $2.5 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock appreciation rights. The unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.9 years. No stock appreciation rights were exercised during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 3 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d of the notes to our

approximately $13.9 million, from $26.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to $12.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in total revenue was primarily attributable to the decline in sales of our ribavirin portfolio products. Total revenue includes a $2.0 million milestone payment earned pursuant to a license agreement entered into with Jinghua to develop products using human monoclonal antibodies for each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. We recognized previously deferred revenue from our license and collaboration agreements amounting to $4.4 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Service revenue from our affiliate MeiraGTx Limited (MeiraGTx) was $0.6 million and $1.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nInternational product sales represented approximately 26.9% and 8.6% of total product sales for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, the majority of which were sales in the Netherlands and Ireland.\nSales from our ribavirin portfolio continued to decline in 2017, from $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as the treatment landscape for chronic HCV infection has rapidly evolved, with multiple ribavirin-free treatment regimens, including novel direct-acting antivirals, having entered the market and becoming the new standard of care. As a result, we expect sales of our ribavirin portfolio of products to contribute insignificantly to revenue in 2018 and beyond.\nWe recognized revenue of $1.0 million and $0.6 million from sales of tetrabenazine during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We recognized revenue of $0.2 million and $0.9 million from sales of valganciclovir during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. No meaningful revenue was generated from sales of our other products for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nCost of sales\nCost of sales was $1.3 million and $3.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which relates primarily to the sales volume of our ribavirin portfolio of products.\nWrite-down of inventory\nWe recognized $1.7 million and $0.4 million of inventory write-downs during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, of our Ribasphere inventory based on our expectation that such inventory will not be sold prior to reaching its product expiration date.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses increased by 14.0%, or approximately $4.9 million, to $40.8 million, including $2.7 million of non-cash items, for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $35.8 million, including $3.0 million of non-cash items, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in research and development expense was primarily related to direct external costs of developing our product candidates across multiple projects. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recognized $7.6 million and $4.8 million, respectively, in development expenses for tesevatinib; $5.5 million and $2.2 million, respectively, for KD025; $1.0 million and $1.6 million, respectively, for KD034; $6.8 million and $1.4 million, respectively, for other product candidates; and $19.8 million and $25.8 million, respectively, was related to unallocated internal and external costs of developing our product candidates across multiple projects.\nIn June 2016, research and development expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses were revised to conform to the current presentation with regard to our method of allocating a portion of facility-related expenses to research and development expenses to more accurately reflect the effort spent on research and development. We reclassified $2.2 million from selling, general and administrative expense to research and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 65.0%, or approximately $68.9 million, to $37.1 million, including $11.5 million of non-cash items, for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $105.9 million, including $69.1 million of non-cash items, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses is primarily related to a decrease in share-based compensation of $34.6 million, of which $22.0 million is related to the LTIP, $1.8 million is related to the repricing of employee options, $8.3 million is related to an option grant to our Chief Executive Officer and $2.5 million is related to lower share-based compensation for employee options, as well as, a decrease of $3.0 million in severance expense primarily related to the separation agreement with Dr. Samuel D. Waksal, salary and salary-related expenses of $5.6 million related to a reduction in headcount, legal expense of $4.1 million primarily related to legal settlements entered into during 2016, amortization of intangible assets of $15.2 million due to the intangible asset being fully amortized at December 31, 2016, royalty expense of $1.0 million and consulting fees of $3.0 million resulting from the expiration of an advisory agreement entered into in April 2015.\nGain on settlement of payable\nGain on settlement of payable is primarily related to a gain of $3.9 million resulting from the mutual termination agreement entered into with Valeant during the first quarter of 2016.\nOther expense\nThe following table provides components of other expense:\n\ufeff\nTable 323: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nYears Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>3,720 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>3,782 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense - beneficial conversion feature\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>45,915 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest paid-in-kind\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>14,695 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWrite-off of deferred financing costs and debt discount\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>3,820 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAmortization of deferred financing costs and debt discount\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2,242 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>4,422 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>11,176 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nChange in fair value of financial instruments\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(2,096) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(4,380) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLoss on equity method investment\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>7,599 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>13,625 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther income\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(126) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(46) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther expense\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>11,339 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>93,009 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, other expense consisted primarily of interest expense and other costs related to our debt of $6.0 million and a loss on equity method investment in MeiraGTx of $7.6 million, partially offset by a change in the fair value of financial instruments of $2.1 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, other expense consisted primarily of interest expense and other costs related to our debt of $72.6 million, a loss on extinguishment of debt of $11.2 million related to the exchange agreements dated as of June 8, 2016 and a loss on equity method investment in MeiraGTx of $13.6 million, partially offset by a change in the fair value of financial instruments of $4.4 million.\nIncome taxes\nHistorically we were a limited liability company taxed as a C corporation for federal and state tax purposes. On July 26, 2016, we effected the Corporate Conversion whereby we converted from a Delaware limited liability company to a Delaware corporation pursuant to a statutory conversion. We recorded an income tax benefit of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 related to a $0.4 million adjustment to the deferred tax liability, net of $0.3 million of income tax expense related to a $2.0 million milestone payment received from Jinghua. We recorded income tax expense of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, related to a $2.0 million milestone payment received from Jinghua.\nDeemed Dividend\nWe calculated a deemed dividend on the Class E redeemable convertible units of $13.4 million in August 2016, which equaled a 15% discount to the price per share of our common stock of $12.00 in the IPO upon conversion to common stock at our IPO due to a beneficial conversion feature. The Class E redeemable convertible units converted into common stock at our IPO resulting in no Class E redeemable convertible units outstanding at both December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nAt our IPO, we issued 30,000 shares of convertible preferred stock which accrues dividends at a rate of 5% and converts into shares of our common stock at a 20% discount to the price per share of our common stock of $12.00 in the IPO. We calculated a deemed dividend on the convertible preferred stock of $7.5 million in August 2016, which equals the 20% discount to the price per share of our common stock in the IPO of $12.00, a beneficial conversion feature. We also accrued dividends on the convertible preferred stock of $1.5 million and $0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Approximately $1.4 million of accrued dividends that were payable on June 30, 2017 was added to the stated liquidation preference amount of the 5% convertible preferred stock, which totaled $31.4 million at December 31, 2017.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nRevenues\nTotal revenue decreased by 26.9%, or approximately $9.6 million, to $26.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $35.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was mostly attributable to the decline in sales of our ribavirin portfolio products. The decrease in total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was partially offset by a $2.0 million milestone payment earned pursuant to a license agreement entered into with Jinghua to develop products using human monoclonal antibodies. We recognized previously deferred revenue from our license and collaboration agreements amounting to $4.4 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Service revenue from our affiliate MeiraGTx Limited (MeiraGTx) was $1.0 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nInternational product sales represented approximately 8.6% and 10.0% of total product sales for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, the majority of which were sales in Netherlands and Germany.\nSales from our ribavirin portfolio continued to decline in 2016, from $29.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. We recognized revenue of $0.6 million from sales of tetrabenazine during the year ended December 31, 2016. No revenue was generated from sales of tetrabenazine in 2015. We recognized revenue of $0.9 million from sales of valganciclovir during the year ended December 31, 2016. No revenue was generated from sales of valganciclovir in 2015. No meaningful revenue was generated from sales of our other products for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nCost of sales\nCost of sales decreased by 5.4%, or approximately $0.2 million, to $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was a direct result of lower sales of our ribavirin portfolio of products.\nWrite-down of inventory\nWe recognized $0.4 million and $2.3 million of inventory write-downs during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, of our Ribasphere inventory based on our expectation that such inventory will not be sold prior to reaching its product expiration date.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses increased by 6.6%, or approximately $2.2 million, to $35.8 million, including $3.0 million of non-cash items, for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $33.6 million, including $2.2 million of non-cash items, for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in research and development expense was primarily related to unallocated internal and external costs of developing our product candidates across multiple projects. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recognized $4.8 million and $4.6 million, respectively, in development expenses for tesevatinib; $2.2 million and $3.0 million, respectively, for KD025; $1.6 million and $1.0 million, respectively, for KD034; $1.4 million and $2.5 million, respectively, for other product candidates; and $25.8 million and $22.5 million, respectively, was related to unallocated internal and external costs of developing our product candidates across multiple projects.\nIn June 2016, research and development expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses were revised to conform to the current presentation with regard to our method of allocating a portion of facility-related expenses to research and development expenses to more accurately reflect the effort spent on research and development. We reclassified $2.2 million and $3.9 million from selling, general and administrative expense to research and development expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n\ufeff\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by 1.1%, or approximately $1.2 million, to $105.9 million, including $69.1 million of non-cash items, for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $104.7 million, including $61.8 million of non-cash items, for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses is primarily related to an increase in share-based compensation of $36.9 million, of which $22.0 million is related to the LTIP, $3.6 million is related to the repricing of employee options, $9.3 million is related to an option grant to our Chief Executive Officer, and $3.0 million is related to an increase in severance expense primarily related to the separation agreement with Dr. Samuel D. Waksal. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in salary and salary-related expenses of $3.7 million related to a reduction in headcount, legal expense of $17.6 million related to legal settlements entered into during 2015, amortization of intangible assets of $12.2 million due to a change to proportional performance method of amortization starting October 1, 2015, royalty expense of $1.5 million and consulting fees of $3.0 million resulting from the expiration of an advisory agreement entered into in April 2015.\nImpairment loss on intangible asset\nIn September 2015, we reviewed the estimated useful life of the Ribasphere product rights and determined that the actual life of the Ribasphere product rights intangible asset was shorter than the estimated useful life used for amortization purposes in our financial statements due to hepatitis C market conditions. As a result, effective September 30, 2015, we changed the estimate of the useful life of our Ribasphere product rights intangible asset to 1.25 years to better reflect the estimated period during which the asset will generate cash flows. We also determined that the estimated fair value of the Ribasphere product rights was impaired and recorded an impairment loss of $31.3 million in September 2015.\nGain on settlement of payable\nGain on settlement of payable is primarily related to a gain of $3.9 million resulting from the mutual termination agreement entered into with Valeant during the first quarter of 2016.\n\ufeff\nOther expense\nThe following table provides components of other expense:\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 324: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nYears Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>3,782 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>7,817 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense - beneficial conversion feature\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>45,915 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest paid-in-kind\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>14,695 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>11,434 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWrite-off of deferred financing costs and debt discount\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>3,820 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2,752 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAmortization of deferred financing costs and debt discount\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>4,422 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>5,157 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>11,176 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2,934 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nChange in fair value of financial instruments\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(4,380) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(1,494) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGain on deconsolidation of subsidiary\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(24,000) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLoss on equity method investment\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>13,625 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2,776 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther income\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(46) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(144) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther expense\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>93,009 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>7,232 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, other expense consisted primarily of interest expense and other costs related to our debt of $72.6 million, a loss on extinguishment of debt of $11.2 million related to the exchange agreements dated as of June 8, 2016, loss on equity method investment in MeiraGTx of $13.6 million and a change in the fair value of financial instruments of $4.4 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, other expense consisted primarily of interest expense and other costs related to our debt of $27.2 million, a loss on extinguishment of debt of $2.9 million related to an amendment to our Senior Convertible Term Loan and a loss on equity method investment in MeiraGTx of $2.8 million, partially offset by a $24.0 million gain recognized upon the deconsolidation of MeiraGTx and a change in the fair value of financial instruments of $1.5 million.\nIncome taxes\nHistorically we were a limited liability company taxed as a C corporation for federal and state tax purposes. On July 26, 2016, we effected the Corporate Conversion whereby we converted from a Delaware limited liability company to a Delaware corporation pursuant to a statutory conversion. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded income tax expense of $0.3 million related to the $2.0 million milestone payment received from Jinghua. No income tax expense was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nDeemed Dividend\nWe calculated a deemed dividend on the Class E redeemable convertible units of $13.4 million in August 2016, which equaled a 15% discount to the price per share of our common stock of $12.00 in the IPO upon conversion to common stock at our IPO due to a beneficial conversion feature. The Class E redeemable convertible units converted into common stock at our IPO resulting in no Class E redeemable convertible units outstanding at December 31, 2016.\nAt our IPO, we issued 30,000 shares of convertible preferred stock which accrues dividends at a rate of 5% and converts into shares of our common stock at a 20% discount to the price per share of our common stock of $12.00 in the IPO. We calculated a deemed dividend on the convertible preferred stock of $7.5 million in August 2016, which equals the 20% discount to the price per share of our common stock in the IPO of $12.00, a beneficial conversion feature. We also accrued dividends on the convertible preferred stock of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our financial results determined in accordance with GAAP, we have also disclosed in the tables below non-GAAP adjusted earnings and non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. These financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude beneficial conversion features and deemed dividends recorded in connection with our IPO and Corporate Conversion (comprehensively Adjustment Items). In addition, from time to time in the future there may be other items that we may exclude for the purposes of our non-GAAP financial measures; likewise, we may in the future cease to exclude items that we have historically excluded for the purpose of our non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating\nresults because they exclude amounts that management and the board of directors do not consider part of core operating results or that are non-recurring when assessing the performance of the organization. We believe that inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency and comparability with past reports of financial results and provides consistency in calculations by outside analysts reviewing our results. Accordingly, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency of supplemental information used by management.\nWe believe that non-GAAP financial measures are helpful in understanding our past financial performance and potential future results, but there are limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting and may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation between companies. Adjustment items that are excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures can have a material impact on net earnings. As a result, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, net loss and its components, earnings per share, or other measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measure. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nReconciliation of GAAP net loss to non-GAAP adjusted earnings are as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 325: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(unaudited)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nReported GAAP net loss attributable to common stockholders\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(81,692) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(230,488) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(147,082) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense - beneficial conversion feature (1)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>45,915 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDeemed dividends (2)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>20,931 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNon-GAAP adjusted net loss attributable to common stockholders\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(81,692) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(163,642) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(147,082) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nReported GAAP basic and diluted net loss per share of common stock\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(1.42) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(9.74) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(18.10) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nImpact of Adjustment Items\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2.82 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNon-GAAP adjusted basic and diluted net loss per share of common stock\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(1.42) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(6.92) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(18.10) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWeighted average basic and diluted shares of common stock outstanding\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>57,405,331 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>23,674,512 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>8,127,781 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\n (1) To exclude the beneficial conversion feature of our debt upon conversion into shares of our common stock on August 1, 2016.

We expect that our research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses will continue to increase as we develop our product candidates. As a result, we will need additional capital to fund our operations, which we may raise through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, other third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. As set forth in the 2015 Credit Agreement, which matures on June 17, 2018, we are required to comply with certain financial covenants and to satisfy a clinical development milestone by December 31, 2017. The clinical development milestone was deemed satisfied in a letter agreement entered into on December 22, 2017 with a majority of lenders under our 2015 Credit Agreement. The 2015 Credit Agreement also required us to raise $17.0 million of capital by December 31, 2017 (the amount remaining under a covenant to raise $40.0 million following previous rounds of financing), which was satisfied in September 2017. At December 31, 2017, we had $67.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2.1 million in restricted cash pursuant to leases for our facilities located in New York, New York, and Cambridge, Massachusetts. Our existing cash is expected to continue to enable us to advance our planned Phase 2 clinical studies for KD025 and tesevatinib and advance certain of our other pipeline product candidates.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP, which contemplate our continuation as a going concern. We have not established a source of revenues sufficient to cover our operating costs, and as such, have been dependent on funding operations through the issuance of debt and sale of equity securities. We expect to incur further losses over the next several years as we develop our business. Further, at December 31, 2017, we had working capital of $13.4 million. Our accumulated deficit amounted to $237.4 million and $155.7 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Net cash used in operating activities was $64.1 million, $53.0 million and $61.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nWe anticipate that we will need to raise additional capital to fund our continued operations. We may not be successful in our efforts to raise additional funds or achieve profitable operations. Amounts raised will be used for further development of our product candidates, to provide financing for marketing and promotion, to secure additional property and equipment, and for other working capital purposes. Even if we are able to raise additional funds through the sale of our equity securities, or loans from financial institutions, our cash needs could be greater than anticipated in which case we could be forced to raise additional capital.\nIn September 2017, we raised $80.4 million in gross proceeds, $75.1 million net of $5.3 million in underwriting fees, commissions and other offering costs and expenses, from the issuance of 26,775,000 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 10,710,000 shares of common stock at an initial exercise price of $3.35 per share for a term of 5 years from the date of issuance at a combined price of $3.001 per share and accompanying warrant. Gross proceeds of $66.8 million closed in September 2017 and the remaining $13.6 million of gross proceeds closed in October 2017. In March 2017, we raised $22.7 million in gross proceeds, $20.9 million net of placement agent fees and other offering costs and expenses, from the issuance of 6,767,855 shares of our common stock, at a price of $3.36 per share, and warrants to purchase 2,707,138 shares of our common stock at an initial exercise price of $4.50 per share and a term of 13 months from the date of issuance. In connection with the offering, we had agreed to file a registration statement to register the shares of common stock and the shares of common stock underlying the warrants for resale. Under the agreement, the registration statement had to be filed within 30 days of the closing of the financing and declared effective within the timeline provided in the agreement. If the applicable deadlines were not met, monthly liquidated damages of 2.0% of the subscription amount (with an 8.0% cap) were due to the purchaser. The registration statement was filed on April 10, 2017 and declared effective on April 21, 2017.\nAt the present time, we have no commitments for any additional financing, and there can be no assurance that, if needed, additional capital will be available to us on commercially acceptable terms or at all. If we cannot obtain the needed capital, we may not be able to become profitable and may have to curtail or cease our operations. These and other factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm's Report issued in connection with our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 stated that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\u201d The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments or classifications that may result from the possible inability of us to continue as a going concern.\nSources of Liquidity\nSince our inception through December 31, 2017, we have raised net proceeds from the issuance of equity and debt. At December 31, 2017, we had $34.6 million of outstanding loans under the 2015 Credit Agreement. The Senior Convertible\nTerm Loan and Second-Lien Convert were mandatorily converted into shares of our common stock at a conversion price equal to 80% of the IPO price per share of common stock in our IPO, or $9.60 per share.\nPursuant to the Third Amendment, principal payments owed under the 2015 Credit Agreement, in the amount of $380,000 per month, were deferred until January 31, 2018. Additionally, the parties amended a future capital raising covenant by extending the time period by which we were required to raise the remaining $17.0 million of capital by six months, from June 30, 2017 to December 31, 2017, which was achieved in September 2017. The warrants issued under the 2015 Credit Agreement were amended so that the exercise price was reduced from $10.20 per warrant to $4.50 per warrant and the cashless exercise feature of the warrant was removed in its entirety requiring the holder to pay cash to exercise the warrant. All other material terms of the 2015 Credit Agreement, including the maturity date, remain the same. As of the date hereof, we are not in default under the terms of the 2015 Credit Agreement. See Note 7, Debt\u201d of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.\nThe following table sets forth the primary sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents for each period set forth below:\nTable 328: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating activities\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(64,098) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(52,950) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>(60,977) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInvesting activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(479) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(539) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(161) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFinancing activities\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>96,001 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>68,084 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>61,645 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>31,424 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>14,595 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>507 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nOperating Activities\nThe net cash used in operating activities was $64.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, and consisted primarily of a net loss of $79.8 million adjusted for $23.2 million in non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization of fixed assets of $1.8 million, write-down of inventory of $1.7 million, amortization of deferred financing costs, debt discount, and debt premium of $2.2 million, loss on equity method investment of $7.6 million and share-based compensation expense of $12.4 million, as well as, a net decrease in operating assets and liabilities of $7.5 million.

Net cash used in investing activities was $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 consisting of costs related to the purchase of property and equipment, primarily related to in-house software purchased to support our internal clinical data management group.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $96.0 million, consisting primarily of proceeds from the issuance of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock in our public offering of $75.1 million, net of underwriting fees, commissions and other offering costs and expenses and proceeds from the issuance of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock in our private placement of $20.9 million, net of placement agent fees and other offering costs and expenses.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $68.1 million, consisting primarily of proceeds from the issuance of common stock in our IPO of $69.8 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions, and net proceeds from the issuance of Class E redeemable convertible units of $5.5 million, partially offset by payment of offerings costs of $3.3 million and repayment of the related party loan of $3.0 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $61.6 million, consisting of proceeds from the issuance of secured term debt of $35.0 million, proceeds from the issuance of convertible debt of $112.5 million, net proceeds from the issuance of Class A membership units of $15.0 million and net proceeds from the issuance of Class E redeemable convertible units of $10.8 million, partially offset by the repayment of senior secured term debt of $107.2 million and payment of financing costs of $4.1 million.\nFuture Funding Requirements\nWe expect our expenses to increase compared to prior periods in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue research and development, continue and initiate clinical trials and seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates. In anticipation of regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant pre-commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing.\nThe expected use of our cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2017 represents our intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could change in the future as our plans and business conditions evolve. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including the progress of our development, the status of, and results from, clinical trials, the potential need to conduct additional clinical trials to obtain approval of our product candidates for all intended indications, as well as any additional collaborations that we may enter into with third parties for our product candidates and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of our existing cash and cash equivalents. In addition, we anticipate the need to raise additional funds from the issuance of additional equity, and our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of those funds as well.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2017:\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 329: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nPayments due by period (in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nLess than\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nMore than\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n1 - 3 years\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n3 - 5 years\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSecured term debt\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>34,620 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>34,620 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense(1)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,653 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,653 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating leases(2)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>33,463 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>4,579 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>8,566 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>8,434 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>11,884 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal(3)\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>69,736 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>40,852 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>8,566 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>8,434 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>11,884 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\n_________________________\n (1) Interest expense reflects our obligation to make cash interest payments in connection with our 2015 Credit Agreement at a rate of 10.375%. \n (2) Operating lease obligations primarily reflect our obligation to make payments in connection with leases for our corporate headquarters and commercial headquarters distribution center. \n (3) This table does not include: (a) milestone payments totaling $400.4 million which may become payable to third parties under license agreements as the timing and likelihood of such payments are not known with certainty; (b) any royalty payments to third parties as the amounts, timing and likelihood of such payments are not known with certainty; and (c) contracts that are entered into in the ordinary course of business which are not material in the aggregate in any period presented above. \nOff-balance Sheet Arrangements\nDuring the periods presented we did not have, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under the SEC rules.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and related notes appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery, development and commercialization of small molecules and biologics to address significant unmet medical needs. We are developing product candidates within inflammatory and fibrotic diseases, as well as, genetic diseases. Our team, which has a proven track record of successful drug development and commercialization, identifies and develops novel candidates from our small molecule and biologics platforms as well as develops our in-licensed product candidates. By retaining global commercial rights to our lead product candidates, we believe that we have the ability to progress these candidates ourselves while maintaining flexibility for commercial and licensing arrangements. We expect to continue to progress our clinical candidates and have clinical trial data to report throughout 2018.\nOur operations to date have been focused on developing first-in-class innovative therapies for indications with significant unmet medical needs while leveraging our commercial infrastructure. We have never been profitable and had an accumulated deficit of $237.4 million at December 31, 2017. Our net losses were $79.8 million, $208.8 million and $147.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Although our commercial business generates revenue, we expect to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect these losses to increase as we continue our development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our additional product candidates, hire additional personnel and initiate commercialization of any products that receive regulatory approval. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if, or as, we:\n \u00b7 invest significantly to further develop our most advanced product candidates, including KD025, tesevatinib and KD034; \n \u00b7 initiate additional clinical trials and preclinical studies for our other product candidates; \n \u00b7 seek regulatory approval for our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials; \n \u00b7 continue to invest in our ROCK inhibitors and other research platforms; \n \u00b7 seek to identify additional product candidates; \n \u00b7 scale up our sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure and product sourcing capabilities; \n \u00b7 acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies; \n \u00b7 scale up our operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development; \n \u00b7 make milestone or other payments under any in-license agreements; \n \u00b7 maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; or \n \u00b7 operate as a public company. \nOn July 26, 2016, prior to the closing of our IPO we completed a corporate conversion transaction whereby we converted from a Delaware limited liability company into a Delaware corporation and changed our name to Kadmon Holdings, Inc., which we refer to herein as the Corporate Conversion.\u201d As required by the Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of Kadmon Holdings, LLC, the Corporate Conversion was approved by our board of directors. In connection with the Corporate Conversion, holders of our outstanding units received one share of common stock for every 6.5 membership units held immediately prior to the Corporate Conversion, and options and warrants to purchase units became options and warrants to purchase one share of common stock for each unit underlying such options or warrants immediately prior to the Corporate Conversion, at the same aggregate exercise price in effect prior to the Corporate Conversion.\nComponents of Statement of Operations\nRevenue\nOur revenue is substantially derived from sales of our portfolio of products, including our ribavirin portfolio of products and to a lesser extent sales of tetrabenazine and valganciclovir. No meaningful revenue has been generated from sales of our other products. Revenue also includes the recognition of upfront licensing fees and milestone payments received primarily under our license agreement with AbbVie.\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales consists of product costs, including ingredient costs and costs of contract manufacturers for production, and shipping and handling of the products. Also included are costs related to quality release testing and stability testing of the products. Other costs included in cost of sales are packaging costs, warehousing costs and certain allocated costs related to management, facilities and other expenses associated with supply chain logistics.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the development of our product candidates, which include:\n \u00b7 license fees related to our license and collaboration agreements; \n \u00b7 research and development-based employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and other compensation expenses; \n \u00b7 expenses incurred under our agreements with contract research organizations that conduct nonclinical and preclinical studies, and clinical sites and consultants that conduct our clinical trials; \n \u00b7 costs associated with regulatory filings; \n \u00b7 costs of laboratory supplies and the acquisition, development and manufacture of preclinical and clinical study materials and study drugs; and/or \n \u00b7 allocated facility-related expenses. \nOur research and development expenses may vary substantially from period to period based on the timing of our research and development activities, including due to timing of initiation of clinical trials and enrollment of patients in clinical trials. We do not allocate personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation, costs associated with broad technology platform improvements and other indirect costs to specific product candidates. We do not allocate these costs to specific product candidates because they are deployed across multiple overlapping projects under development, making it difficult to specifically and accurately allocate such costs to a particular product candidate.\nThe successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain and subject to numerous risks including, but not limited to:\n \u00b7 the scope, rate of progress and expense of our research and development activities; \n \u00b7 clinical trial results; \n \u00b7 the scope, terms and timing of regulatory approvals; \n \u00b7 the expense of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights; \n \u00b7 the cost, timing and our ability to acquire sufficient clinical and commercial supplies for any product candidates and products that we may develop; and/or \n \u00b7 the risks disclosed in the section entitled Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nA change in the outcome of any of these variables could mean a significant change in the expenses and timing associated with the development of any product candidate.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for non-research personnel, including stock-based compensation and travel expenses for our employees in executive, operational, finance, legal, commercial, regulatory, pharmacovigilance and human resource functions. Other selling, general and administrative expenses include facility-related costs, commercial royalty expense and director compensation, accounting and legal services, consulting costs and programs and marketing costs to support the commercial business.\nOther income (expense)\nOther income (expense) is comprised of interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and interest expense on our outstanding indebtedness, including paid-in-kind interest on our convertible debt and non-cash interest related to the write-off and amortization of debt discount debt premium and deferred financing costs associated with our indebtedness. Our loss on equity method investment in MeiraGTx, as well as, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value of our financial instruments are recognized in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations. Such financial instruments include a success fee and warrant liabilities for which the exercise price was contingent on our per share price in a qualified public offering. The change in fair value is based upon the fair value of the underlying security at the end of each reporting period, as calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, in the case of certain warrant liabilities and the success fee, and a binomial model, in the case of certain warrant liabilities.\nIn addition, we operate in currencies other than the U.S. dollar to fund research and development and commercial activities performed by various third-party vendors. The translation of these currencies into U.S. dollars results in foreign currency gains or losses, depending on the change in value of these currencies against the U.S. dollar. These gains and losses are included in other income (expense).\nIncome taxes\nPrior to the Corporate Conversion, we were a limited liability company but taxed as a C corporation for federal and state tax purposes. On July 26, 2016, we converted from a limited liability company to a Delaware corporation pursuant to a statutory conversion. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had a deferred tax liability of $0.9 million and $1.4 million, respectively, and a full valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets. We experienced ownership changes under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 in 2010, 2011 and 2016, which limits our ability to utilize net operating loss carry-forwards. We did not reduce the gross deferred tax assets related to the net operating loss carry-forwards, however, because the limitations do not hinder our ability to potentially utilize all of the net operating loss carry-forwards\nAs of December 31, 2017, we have unused federal and state net operating loss carry-forwards of $419.2 million and $362.0 million, respectively, that may be applied against future taxable income. These carry-forwards expire at various dates through December 31, 2037. We recorded a valuation allowance to fully offset the gross deferred tax asset, because it is more likely than not that we will not realize future benefits associated with these deferred tax assets at December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nManagement's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reporting amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to intangible assets and goodwill, derivative liabilities, unit-based compensation and accrued expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nShare-based compensation expense\nPrior to our IPO, we were a privately held company with no active public market for our Class A units. Therefore, our management had estimated the fair value of our Class A units at various dates considering our most recently available third-party valuations of Class A units and management's assessment of additional objective and highly subjective factors that it believed were relevant. The consummation of our IPO on August 1, 2016 established a public trading market for shares of our common stock; therefore it is no longer necessary for management to estimate the fair value of our equity in connection with our accounting for granted stock options. In the absence of a public trading market for shares of our common stock, we applied the fair value recognition provisions of FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation.\u201d ASC 718 requires all unit-based payments to employees and directors, including unit option grants and modifications to existing unit options, to be recognized in the statements of operations based on their fair values. We recognize compensation expense over the period during which the recipient renders the required services using the straight-line, single option method.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2016, we adopted ASU 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation.\u201d ASU 2016-09 requires that certain amendments relevant to us be applied using a modified-retrospective transition method by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to accumulated deficit as of the beginning of the period in which the guidance is adopted. As a result of adopting ASU 2016-09 during the three months ended December 31, 2016, we adjusted accumulated deficit for amendments related to an entity-wide accounting policy election to recognize share-based award forfeitures only as they occur rather than estimate a forfeiture rate. We recorded a $2.0 million charge to accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2016 and an associated credit to additional paid-in capital for previously unrecognized stock compensation expense as a result of applying this policy election. Upon the election, we also recorded $0.8 million in additional share-based compensation expense related to the nine months ended September 30, 2016 in the quarter ended December 31, 2016.\nASU 2016-09 also requires the recognition of the income tax effects of awards in the consolidated statement of operations when the awards vest or are settled, thus eliminating addition paid-in capital pools. We elected to adopt the amendments related to the presentation of excess tax benefits on the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows using a prospective transition method.\nAs there had been no public market for our Class A units prior to our IPO, the estimated fair value of our Class A units had been determined contemporaneously by our board of directors utilizing independent third-party valuations prepared in accordance with the guidance outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, also known as the Practice Aid for financial reporting purposes. We performed contemporaneous valuations of our Class A units concurrently with the achievement of significant milestones or with major financing events as of October 31, 2014 ($39.00) and September 30, 2015 ($32.50). In conducting these valuation analyses, we considered all objective and subjective factors that we believed to be relevant for each valuation conducted, including:\n \u00b7 recent equity financings and the related valuations; \n \u00b7 industry information such as market size and growth; \n \u00b7 market capitalization of comparable companies and the estimated value of transactions such companies have engaged in; and/or \n \u00b7 macroeconomic conditions. \nOn July 13, 2016, the compensation committee of our board of directors approved an option award for Dr. Harlan W. Waksal, increasing the number of options (giving effect to the Corporate Conversion) subject to his original option grant. The number of shares subject to this option award was equal to the difference between the 769,231 options originally granted to Dr. Harlan W. Waksal and 5% of our outstanding common equity determined on a fully diluted basis on the IPO date, which amounted to 1,630,536 options. The effective date of the new option award was the IPO date of July 26, 2016. The exercise price per share of common stock subject to the new incremental options awarded was equal to the price per share of common stock at the IPO date of $12.00. The option award is subject to the same vesting schedule applicable to the original option grant such that all options awarded will vest on August 4, 2017. In consideration for the new option award, Dr. Harlan W. Waksal has committed to perform an additional year of service through August 4, 2018 in connection with receipt of the additional option shares. In the event Dr. Harlan W. Waksal voluntarily terminates his employment prior to completion of this additional year of service, Dr. Harlan W. Waksal shall forfeit 25% of the additional options, or 25% of the aggregate additional option gain associated with the additional option shares in the event the options are exercised, as applicable. This modification resulted in a $12.4 million charge, of which the incremental value of the previously vested portion of the awards totaling $8.3 million was expensed during the third quarter of 2016 and the remaining amount of the unvested portion totaling $4.1 million will be recognized over the remaining service period through August 4, 2018.\n\ufeff\nThe assumptions relating to the valuation of our options granted for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 are shown below.\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\nThe following table summarizes by grant date the number of shares subject to options granted since January 1, 2015, the per share exercise price of the options, the fair value of common stock underlying the options on date of grant and the per share estimated fair value of the options:\n\n_________________________\n (1) At the time of the option grants on January 5, 2015, management determined that the fair value of our Class A membership units of $39.00 per unit calculated in the valuation as of October 31, 2014 reasonably reflected the per unit fair value of Class A membership units as of the grant date. \n (2) In December 2014, our board of directors approved an option grant to the Chief Executive Officer when the fair value of our Class A membership units was $39.00 per unit calculated in the valuation as of October 31, 2014. The option grant was not issued until December 31, 2015, however, management determined that the exercise price should be the fair value of our Class A membership units when the grant was approved by our board of directors in December 2014 of $39.00 per unit. \n (3) At the time of the option grants on December 31, 2015, management determined that the fair value of our Class A membership units of $32.50 per unit calculated in the valuation as of September 30, 2015 reasonably reflected the per unit fair value of Class A membership units as of the grant date. \nIn January 2015, the compensation committee of our board of directors approved the amendments of all outstanding option awards under the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan with an exercise price above $39.00 per unit to reduce the exercise price of such options to $39.00 per unit, the estimated fair value of our Class A membership units as of October 31, 2014. The vesting schedule of such awards was not amended. The amendment to the option awards resulted in a modification charge of $1.1 million, of which $0.7 million was expensed immediately during the first quarter of 2015 and the remaining amount is being recognized over the vesting periods of each award, which range from one to two years.\nOn July 13, 2016, the compensation committee of our board of directors approved the amendment of all outstanding option awards issued under our 2011 Equity Incentive Plan whereby, effective upon pricing of our IPO, the exercise price (on a post-Corporate Conversion, post-split basis) was adjusted to equal the price per share of our common stock in the IPO. Options to purchase an aggregate of approximately 1.6 million shares of our Class A units were modified. The vesting schedule of such awards was not modified. The modification resulted in a $4.0 million charge, of which the incremental value of the previously vested portion of the awards totaling $1.8 million was expensed immediately during the third quarter of 2016 and the remaining $2.2 million will be recognized over the remaining vesting periods of each award. These vesting periods range from one to three years.\nA total of 9,750 units were granted under the LTIP at December 31, 2017 and 2016. The compensation expense for these awards was recognized upon consummation of our IPO on August 1, 2016 and was recorded as additional paid in capital. No compensation expense had been recorded prior to this date. We utilized a Monte-Carlo simulation to determine the fair value of the awards granted under the LTIP of $22.6 million, which was recorded during the third quarter of 2016 as these awards are not forfeitable. The LTIP is payable upon the fair market value of our common stock exceeding 333% of the $6.00 grant price ($20.00) per share prior to December 7, 2024. The holders of the LTIP have no right to demand a particular form of payment, and we reserve the right to make payment in the form of cash or common stock.\nWe granted 1,040,000 stock appreciation rights to three executive employees on December 8, 2017. No stock appreciation rights were granted under the 2016 Equity Plan prior to 2017. The weighted-average fair value of the stock appreciation rights granted to the three executive officers was $2.42 and was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: risk-free interest rate of 2.22%, expected term of 6 years, expected volatility of 74.92%, share price of $3.64, strike price of $3.64 and a dividend rate of 0%.\nCompensation expense for stock appreciation rights is recognized on a straight-line basis over the awards' requisite service period. At December 31, 2017, there was $2.5 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock appreciation rights. The unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.9 years. No stock appreciation rights were exercised during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 3 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements.\n\ufeff\nResults of Operations\n\n\ufeff\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nRevenues\nTotal revenue decreased by 53.3%, or approximately $13.9 million, from $26.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to $12.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in total revenue was primarily attributable to the decline in sales of our ribavirin portfolio products. Total revenue includes a $2.0 million milestone payment earned pursuant to a license agreement entered into with Jinghua to develop products using human monoclonal antibodies for each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. We recognized previously deferred revenue from our license and collaboration agreements amounting to $4.4 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Service revenue from our affiliate MeiraGTx Limited (MeiraGTx) was $0.6 million and $1.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nInternational product sales represented approximately 26.9% and 8.6% of total product sales for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, the majority of which were sales in the Netherlands and Ireland.\nSales from our ribavirin portfolio continued to decline in 2017, from $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as the treatment landscape for chronic HCV infection has rapidly evolved, with multiple ribavirin-free treatment regimens, including novel direct-acting antivirals, having entered the market and becoming the new standard of care. As a result, we expect sales of our ribavirin portfolio of products to contribute insignificantly to revenue in 2018 and beyond.\nWe recognized revenue of $1.0 million and $0.6 million from sales of tetrabenazine during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We recognized revenue of $0.2 million and $0.9 million from sales of valganciclovir during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. No meaningful revenue was generated from sales of our other products for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nCost of sales\nCost of sales was $1.3 million and $3.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which relates primarily to the sales volume of our ribavirin portfolio of products.\nWrite-down of inventory\nWe recognized $1.7 million and $0.4 million of inventory write-downs during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, of our Ribasphere inventory based on our expectation that such inventory will not be sold prior to reaching its product expiration date.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses increased by 14.0%, or approximately $4.9 million, to $40.8 million, including $2.7 million of non-cash items, for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $35.8 million, including $3.0 million of non-cash items, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in research and development expense was primarily related to direct external costs of developing our product candidates across multiple projects. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recognized $7.6 million and $4.8 million, respectively, in development expenses for tesevatinib; $5.5 million and $2.2 million, respectively, for KD025; $1.0 million and $1.6 million, respectively, for KD034; $6.8 million and $1.4 million, respectively, for other product candidates; and $19.8 million and $25.8 million, respectively, was related to unallocated internal and external costs of developing our product candidates across multiple projects.\nIn June 2016, research and development expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses were revised to conform to the current presentation with regard to our method of allocating a portion of facility-related expenses to research and development expenses to more accurately reflect the effort spent on research and development. We reclassified $2.2 million from selling, general and administrative expense to research and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 65.0%, or approximately $68.9 million, to $37.1 million, including $11.5 million of non-cash items, for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $105.9 million, including $69.1 million of non-cash items, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses is primarily related to a decrease in share-based compensation of $34.6 million, of which $22.0 million is related to the LTIP, $1.8 million is related to the repricing of employee options, $8.3 million is related to an option grant to our Chief Executive Officer and $2.5 million is related to lower share-based compensation for employee options, as well as, a decrease of $3.0 million in severance expense primarily related to the separation agreement with Dr. Samuel D. Waksal, salary and salary-related expenses of $5.6 million related to a reduction in headcount, legal expense of $4.1 million primarily related to legal settlements entered into during 2016, amortization of intangible assets of $15.2 million due to the intangible asset being fully amortized at December 31, 2016, royalty expense of $1.0 million and consulting fees of $3.0 million resulting from the expiration of an advisory agreement entered into in April 2015.\nGain on settlement of payable\nGain on settlement of payable is primarily related to a gain of $3.9 million resulting from the mutual termination agreement entered into with Valeant during the first quarter of 2016.\nOther expense\nThe following table provides components of other expense:\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, other expense consisted primarily of interest expense and other costs related to our debt of $6.0 million and a loss on equity method investment in MeiraGTx of $7.6 million, partially offset by a change in the fair value of financial instruments of $2.1 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, other expense consisted primarily of interest expense and other costs related to our debt of $72.6 million, a loss on extinguishment of debt of $11.2 million related to the exchange agreements dated as of June 8, 2016 and a loss on equity method investment in MeiraGTx of $13.6 million, partially offset by a change in the fair value of financial instruments of $4.4 million.\nIncome taxes\nHistorically we were a limited liability company taxed as a C corporation for federal and state tax purposes. On July 26, 2016, we effected the Corporate Conversion whereby we converted from a Delaware limited liability company to a Delaware corporation pursuant to a statutory conversion. We recorded an income tax benefit of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 related to a $0.4 million adjustment to the deferred tax liability, net of $0.3 million of income tax expense related to a $2.0 million milestone payment received from Jinghua. We recorded income tax expense of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, related to a $2.0 million milestone payment received from Jinghua.\nDeemed Dividend\nWe calculated a deemed dividend on the Class E redeemable convertible units of $13.4 million in August 2016, which equaled a 15% discount to the price per share of our common stock of $12.00 in the IPO upon conversion to common stock at our IPO due to a beneficial conversion feature. The Class E redeemable convertible units converted into common stock at our IPO resulting in no Class E redeemable convertible units outstanding at both December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nAt our IPO, we issued 30,000 shares of convertible preferred stock which accrues dividends at a rate of 5% and converts into shares of our common stock at a 20% discount to the price per share of our common stock of $12.00 in the IPO. We calculated a deemed dividend on the convertible preferred stock of $7.5 million in August 2016, which equals the 20% discount to the price per share of our common stock in the IPO of $12.00, a beneficial conversion feature. We also accrued dividends on the convertible preferred stock of $1.5 million and $0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Approximately $1.4 million of accrued dividends that were payable on June 30, 2017 was added to the stated liquidation preference amount of the 5% convertible preferred stock, which totaled $31.4 million at December 31, 2017.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nRevenues\nTotal revenue decreased by 26.9%, or approximately $9.6 million, to $26.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $35.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was mostly attributable to the decline in sales of our ribavirin portfolio products. The decrease in total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was partially offset by a $2.0 million milestone payment earned pursuant to a license agreement entered into with Jinghua to develop products using human monoclonal antibodies. We recognized previously deferred revenue from our license and collaboration agreements amounting to $4.4 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Service revenue from our affiliate MeiraGTx Limited (MeiraGTx) was $1.0 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nInternational product sales represented approximately 8.6% and 10.0% of total product sales for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, the majority of which were sales in Netherlands and Germany.\nSales from our ribavirin portfolio continued to decline in 2016, from $29.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. We recognized revenue of $0.6 million from sales of tetrabenazine during the year ended December 31, 2016. No revenue was generated from sales of tetrabenazine in 2015. We recognized revenue of $0.9 million from sales of valganciclovir during the year ended December 31, 2016. No revenue was generated from sales of valganciclovir in 2015. No meaningful revenue was generated from sales of our other products for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nCost of sales\nCost of sales decreased by 5.4%, or approximately $0.2 million, to $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was a direct result of lower sales of our ribavirin portfolio of products.\nWrite-down of inventory\nWe recognized $0.4 million and $2.3 million of inventory write-downs during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, of our Ribasphere inventory based on our expectation that such inventory will not be sold prior to reaching its product expiration date.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses increased by 6.6%, or approximately $2.2 million, to $35.8 million, including $3.0 million of non-cash items, for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $33.6 million, including $2.2 million of non-cash items, for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in research and development expense was primarily related to unallocated internal and external costs of developing our product candidates across multiple projects. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recognized $4.8 million and $4.6 million, respectively, in development expenses for tesevatinib; $2.2 million and $3.0 million, respectively, for KD025; $1.6 million and $1.0 million, respectively, for KD034; $1.4 million and $2.5 million, respectively, for other product candidates; and $25.8 million and $22.5 million, respectively, was related to unallocated internal and external costs of developing our product candidates across multiple projects.\nIn June 2016, research and development expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses were revised to conform to the current presentation with regard to our method of allocating a portion of facility-related expenses to research and development expenses to more accurately reflect the effort spent on research and development. We reclassified $2.2 million and $3.9 million from selling, general and administrative expense to research and development expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n\ufeff\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by 1.1%, or approximately $1.2 million, to $105.9 million, including $69.1 million of non-cash items, for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $104.7 million, including $61.8 million of non-cash items, for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses is primarily related to an increase in share-based compensation of $36.9 million, of which $22.0 million is related to the LTIP, $3.6 million is related to the repricing of employee options, $9.3 million is related to an option grant to our Chief Executive Officer, and $3.0 million is related to an increase in severance expense primarily related to the separation agreement with Dr. Samuel D. Waksal. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in salary and salary-related expenses of $3.7 million related to a reduction in headcount, legal expense of $17.6 million related to legal settlements entered into during 2015, amortization of intangible assets of $12.2 million due to a change to proportional performance method of amortization starting October 1, 2015, royalty expense of $1.5 million and consulting fees of $3.0 million resulting from the expiration of an advisory agreement entered into in April 2015.\nImpairment loss on intangible asset\nIn September 2015, we reviewed the estimated useful life of the Ribasphere product rights and determined that the actual life of the Ribasphere product rights intangible asset was shorter than the estimated useful life used for amortization purposes in our financial statements due to hepatitis C market conditions. As a result, effective September 30, 2015, we changed the estimate of the useful life of our Ribasphere product rights intangible asset to 1.25 years to better reflect the estimated period during which the asset will generate cash flows. We also determined that the estimated fair value of the Ribasphere product rights was impaired and recorded an impairment loss of $31.3 million in September 2015.\nGain on settlement of payable\nGain on settlement of payable is primarily related to a gain of $3.9 million resulting from the mutual termination agreement entered into with Valeant during the first quarter of 2016.\n\ufeff\nOther expense\nThe following table provides components of other expense:\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, other expense consisted primarily of interest expense and other costs related to our debt of $72.6 million, a loss on extinguishment of debt of $11.2 million related to the exchange agreements dated as of June 8, 2016, loss on equity method investment in MeiraGTx of $13.6 million and a change in the fair value of financial instruments of $4.4 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, other expense consisted primarily of interest expense and other costs related to our debt of $27.2 million, a loss on extinguishment of debt of $2.9 million related to an amendment to our Senior Convertible Term Loan and a loss on equity method investment in MeiraGTx of $2.8 million, partially offset by a $24.0 million gain recognized upon the deconsolidation of MeiraGTx and a change in the fair value of financial instruments of $1.5 million.\nIncome taxes\nHistorically we were a limited liability company taxed as a C corporation for federal and state tax purposes. On July 26, 2016, we effected the Corporate Conversion whereby we converted from a Delaware limited liability company to a Delaware corporation pursuant to a statutory conversion. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded income tax expense of $0.3 million related to the $2.0 million milestone payment received from Jinghua. No income tax expense was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nDeemed Dividend\nWe calculated a deemed dividend on the Class E redeemable convertible units of $13.4 million in August 2016, which equaled a 15% discount to the price per share of our common stock of $12.00 in the IPO upon conversion to common stock at our IPO due to a beneficial conversion feature. The Class E redeemable convertible units converted into common stock at our IPO resulting in no Class E redeemable convertible units outstanding at December 31, 2016.\nAt our IPO, we issued 30,000 shares of convertible preferred stock which accrues dividends at a rate of 5% and converts into shares of our common stock at a 20% discount to the price per share of our common stock of $12.00 in the IPO. We calculated a deemed dividend on the convertible preferred stock of $7.5 million in August 2016, which equals the 20% discount to the price per share of our common stock in the IPO of $12.00, a beneficial conversion feature. We also accrued dividends on the convertible preferred stock of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our financial results determined in accordance with GAAP, we have also disclosed in the tables below non-GAAP adjusted earnings and non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. These financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude beneficial conversion features and deemed dividends recorded in connection with our IPO and Corporate Conversion (comprehensively Adjustment Items). In addition, from time to time in the future there may be other items that we may exclude for the purposes of our non-GAAP financial measures; likewise, we may in the future cease to exclude items that we have historically excluded for the purpose of our non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating\nresults because they exclude amounts that management and the board of directors do not consider part of core operating results or that are non-recurring when assessing the performance of the organization. We believe that inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency and comparability with past reports of financial results and provides consistency in calculations by outside analysts reviewing our results. Accordingly, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency of supplemental information used by management.\nWe believe that non-GAAP financial measures are helpful in understanding our past financial performance and potential future results, but there are limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting and may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation between companies. Adjustment items that are excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures can have a material impact on net earnings. As a result, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, net loss and its components, earnings per share, or other measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measure. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nReconciliation of GAAP net loss to non-GAAP adjusted earnings are as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\n (1) To exclude the beneficial conversion feature of our debt upon conversion into shares of our common stock on August 1, 2016. This adjustment also includes the beneficial conversion feature of certain outstanding warrants which became exercisable into shares of our common stock on August 1, 2016 (see Note 8, Financial Instruments,\u201d of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). \n (2) To exclude the beneficial conversion feature of our Series E redeemable convertible units upon conversion into shares of our common stock on August 1, 2016 and our convertible preferred stock which converts into shares of our common stock at a 20% discount to the IPO price of $12.00 per share (see Note 4, Stockholders' Equity (Deficit),\u201d of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nSince inception, we have incurred operating losses and anticipate that we will continue to incur operating losses for the next several years. We expect that our research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses will continue to increase as we develop our product candidates. As a result, we will need additional capital to fund our operations, which we may raise through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, other third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. As set forth in the 2015 Credit Agreement, which matures on June 17, 2018, we are required to comply with certain financial covenants and to satisfy a clinical development milestone by December 31, 2017. The clinical development milestone was deemed satisfied in a letter agreement entered into on December 22, 2017 with a majority of lenders under our 2015 Credit Agreement. The 2015 Credit Agreement also required us to raise $17.0 million of capital by December 31, 2017 (the amount remaining under a covenant to raise $40.0 million following previous rounds of financing), which was satisfied in September 2017. At December 31, 2017, we had $67.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2.1 million in restricted cash pursuant to leases for our facilities located in New York, New York, and Cambridge, Massachusetts. Our existing cash is expected to continue to enable us to advance our planned Phase 2 clinical studies for KD025 and tesevatinib and advance certain of our other pipeline product candidates.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP, which contemplate our continuation as a going concern. We have not established a source of revenues sufficient to cover our operating costs, and as such, have been dependent on funding operations through the issuance of debt and sale of equity securities. We expect to incur further losses over the next several years as we develop our business. Further, at December 31, 2017, we had working capital of $13.4 million. Our accumulated deficit amounted to $237.4 million and $155.7 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Net cash used in operating activities was $64.1 million, $53.0 million and $61.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nWe anticipate that we will need to raise additional capital to fund our continued operations. We may not be successful in our efforts to raise additional funds or achieve profitable operations. Amounts raised will be used for further development of our product candidates, to provide financing for marketing and promotion, to secure additional property and equipment, and for other working capital purposes. Even if we are able to raise additional funds through the sale of our equity securities, or loans from financial institutions, our cash needs could be greater than anticipated in which case we could be forced to raise additional capital.\nIn September 2017, we raised $80.4 million in gross proceeds, $75.1 million net of $5.3 million in underwriting fees, commissions and other offering costs and expenses, from the issuance of 26,775,000 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 10,710,000 shares of common stock at an initial exercise price of $3.35 per share for a term of 5 years from the date of issuance at a combined price of $3.001 per share and accompanying warrant. Gross proceeds of $66.8 million closed in September 2017 and the remaining $13.6 million of gross proceeds closed in October 2017. In March 2017, we raised $22.7 million in gross proceeds, $20.9 million net of placement agent fees and other offering costs and expenses, from the issuance of 6,767,855 shares of our common stock, at a price of $3.36 per share, and warrants to purchase 2,707,138 shares of our common stock at an initial exercise price of $4.50 per share and a term of 13 months from the date of issuance. In connection with the offering, we had agreed to file a registration statement to register the shares of common stock and the shares of common stock underlying the warrants for resale. Under the agreement, the registration statement had to be filed within 30 days of the closing of the financing and declared effective within the timeline provided in the agreement. If the applicable deadlines were not met, monthly liquidated damages of 2.0% of the subscription amount (with an 8.0% cap) were due to the purchaser. The registration statement was filed on April 10, 2017 and declared effective on April 21, 2017.\nAt the present time, we have no commitments for any additional financing, and there can be no assurance that, if needed, additional capital will be available to us on commercially acceptable terms or at all. If we cannot obtain the needed capital, we may not be able to become profitable and may have to curtail or cease our operations. These and other factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm's Report issued in connection with our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 stated that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\u201d The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments or classifications that may result from the possible inability of us to continue as a going concern.\nSources of Liquidity\nSince our inception through December 31, 2017, we have raised net proceeds from the issuance of equity and debt. At December 31, 2017, we had $34.6 million of outstanding loans under the 2015 Credit Agreement. The Senior Convertible\nTerm Loan and Second-Lien Convert were mandatorily converted into shares of our common stock at a conversion price equal to 80% of the IPO price per share of common stock in our IPO, or $9.60 per share.\nPursuant to the Third Amendment, principal payments owed under the 2015 Credit Agreement, in the amount of $380,000 per month, were deferred until January 31, 2018. Additionally, the parties amended a future capital raising covenant by extending the time period by which we were required to raise the remaining $17.0 million of capital by six months, from June 30, 2017 to December 31, 2017, which was achieved in September 2017. The warrants issued under the 2015 Credit Agreement were amended so that the exercise price was reduced from $10.20 per warrant to $4.50 per warrant and the cashless exercise feature of the warrant was removed in its entirety requiring the holder to pay cash to exercise the warrant. All other material terms of the 2015 Credit Agreement, including the maturity date, remain the same. As of the date hereof, we are not in default under the terms of the 2015 Credit Agreement. See Note 7, Debt\u201d of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.\nThe following table sets forth the primary sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents for each period set forth below:\n\n\ufeff\nOperating Activities\nThe net cash used in operating activities was $64.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, and consisted primarily of a net loss of $79.8 million adjusted for $23.2 million in non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization of fixed assets of $1.8 million, write-down of inventory of $1.7 million, amortization of deferred financing costs, debt discount, and debt premium of $2.2 million, loss on equity method investment of $7.6 million and share-based compensation expense of $12.4 million, as well as, a net decrease in operating assets and liabilities of $7.5 million. The net loss, adjusted for non-cash items, was primarily driven by selling, general and administrative expenses of $25.6 million, research and development expense related to the advancement of our clinical product candidates of $38.1 million and interest paid on our debt of $3.7 million, partially offset by the net sales less cost of sales primarily from our ribavirin portfolio of products of $3.9 million and milestone revenue from our license agreement with Jinghua amounting to $2.0 million.\nThe net cash used in operating activities was $53.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and consisted primarily of a net loss of $208.8 million adjusted for $157.2 million in non-cash items, including the amortization of intangible assets of $15.2 million, depreciation and amortization of fixed assets of $2.3 million, amortization and write-off of deferred financing costs and debt discount of $8.2 million, loss on extinguishment of debt of $11.2 million, fair value of units issued to third parties to settle obligations of $7.4 million, gain on settlement of payables of $4.1 million, paid-in-kind interest expense of $14.7 million, loss on equity method investment of $13.6 million, beneficial conversion feature expense on convertible debt and warrants of $45.9 million and share-based compensation expense of $47.2 million, as well as a net decrease in operating assets and liabilities of $1.8 million. The net loss, adjusted for non-cash items, was primarily driven by selling, general and administrative expenses of $36.8 million, research and development expense related to the advancement of our clinical product candidates of $32.8 million and interest paid on our debt of $3.7 million partially offset by the net sales less cost of sales primarily from our ribavirin portfolio of products of $15.0 million and milestone revenue from our license agreement with Jinghua amounting to $2.0 million.\nThe net cash used in operating activities was $61.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, and consisted primarily of a net loss of $147.1 million adjusted for $96.3 million in non-cash items, including the amortization and impairment of intangible assets of $58.7 million, depreciation of $2.3 million, amortization and write-off of deferred financing costs and debt discount of $7.9 million, gain on deconsolidation of subsidiary of $24.0 million, fair value of units issued to third parties to settle obligations of $13.6 million, accrued legal settlement of $10.4 million, loss on extinguishment of debt of $2.9 million, paid-in-kind interest expense of $11.4 million and share-based compensation expense of $10.3 million, as well as a net decrease in operating assets and liabilities of $10.5 million. The net loss, adjusted for non-cash items, was primarily driven by selling, general and administrative expenses of $42.9 million, research and development expense related to the advancement of our clinical product candidates of $31.4 million and interest paid on our debt of $8.0 million partially offset by the net sales less cost of sales of our ribavirin portfolio of products of $25.6 million.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $0.5 million for both the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 consisting of costs related to leasehold improvements at our clinical office in Cambridge, Massachusetts and the purchase of property and equipment, primarily related to in-house software purchased to support our internal clinical data management group. Net cash used in investing activities was $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 consisting of costs related to the purchase of property and equipment, primarily related to in-house software purchased to support our internal clinical data management group.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $96.0 million, consisting primarily of proceeds from the issuance of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock in our public offering of $75.1 million, net of underwriting fees, commissions and other offering costs and expenses and proceeds from the issuance of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock in our private placement of $20.9 million, net of placement agent fees and other offering costs and expenses.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $68.1 million, consisting primarily of proceeds from the issuance of common stock in our IPO of $69.8 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions, and net proceeds from the issuance of Class E redeemable convertible units of $5.5 million, partially offset by payment of offerings costs of $3.3 million and repayment of the related party loan of $3.0 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $61.6 million, consisting of proceeds from the issuance of secured term debt of $35.0 million, proceeds from the issuance of convertible debt of $112.5 million, net proceeds from the issuance of Class A membership units of $15.0 million and net proceeds from the issuance of Class E redeemable convertible units of $10.8 million, partially offset by the repayment of senior secured term debt of $107.2 million and payment of financing costs of $4.1 million.\nFuture Funding Requirements\nWe expect our expenses to increase compared to prior periods in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue research and development, continue and initiate clinical trials and seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates. In anticipation of regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant pre-commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing.\nThe expected use of our cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2017 represents our intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could change in the future as our plans and business conditions evolve. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including the progress of our development, the status of, and results from, clinical trials, the potential need to conduct additional clinical trials to obtain approval of our product candidates for all intended indications, as well as any additional collaborations that we may enter into with third parties for our product candidates and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of our existing cash and cash equivalents. In addition, we anticipate the need to raise additional funds from the issuance of additional equity, and our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of those funds as well.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2017:\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n_________________________\n (1) Interest expense reflects our obligation to make cash interest payments in connection with our 2015 Credit Agreement at a rate of 10.375%. \n (2) Operating lease obligations primarily reflect our obligation to make
