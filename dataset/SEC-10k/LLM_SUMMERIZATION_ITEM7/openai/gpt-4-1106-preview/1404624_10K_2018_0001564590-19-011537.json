Through our proprietary technology platforms and end-to-end customer service capabilities, we design, administer and fulfill loyalty and customer engagement programs and solutions that strengthen and expand the value of customer relationships for many of the world's largest and most respected companies. Our programs and solutions include:\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Loyalty solutions that help reward, motivate and retain consumers. We create and manage any and all aspects of our clients' points-based loyalty programs, including design, platform, analytics, points management and fulfillment. Our loyalty solutions offer relevant, best-in-class rewards (such as travel, gift cards and merchandise) to consumers enabling clients to motivate, retain and thank their best customers. For example, our platform and technology support points-based programs for financial services, automotive, gaming, travel and hospitality companies.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Customer engagement programs and solutions that address key consumer needs such as greater peace of mind and meaningful savings for everyday purchases. We provide these solutions to leading companies in the financial institution, telecommunications, ecommerce, retail and travel sectors globally. These differentiated programs help our clients enrich their offerings to drive deeper connections with their customers, and to encourage their customers to engage more, stay loyal and generate more revenue for our clients. For example, we develop and manage programs such as identity theft protection, credit monitoring, savings on everyday purchases, concierge services, discount travel services and roadside assistance.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company had a domestic insurance business that served as a leading third-party agent, administrator and marketer of certain accident and life insurance solutions. As discussed further in Note 4-Discontinued Operations in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein, we completed the sale of the domestic insurance business, which comprised substantially all of our Insurance Solutions operating segment, on August 15, 2018. The divestiture of the domestic insurance business marked an additional step in our strategic plan and ongoing transformation into a pure-play loyalty solutions company.\nOur financial business model is characterized by substantial recurring revenues. We generate revenue primarily in three ways:\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Fee for service: we generate revenues from our clients through our loyalty business by designing (management, analytics and customer experience) and administering points-based loyalty programs on a platform licensing, fee-for-service basis. We also generate revenues for desired customer engagement programs and solutions, typically through a licensing and/or per-user fee.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Commission or transaction fee: we earn a commission from our suppliers and/or a transaction fee from our clients based on volume for enabling or executing transactions such as fees generated from loyalty points related purchases and redemption. We can also generate revenues based on a per-subscriber and/or a per-activity commission fee from our clients for our services.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Subscription: we generate revenues through the sale of our value-added subscription-based programs and solutions to the customers of our clients whom we bill on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGlobal Reorganization\nEffective January 1, 2016, we implemented a new globalized organizational structure (the Global Reorganization\u201d) to better support our key strategic initiatives and enhance long-term revenue growth. This organizational structure allows us to combine similar lines of business on common platforms and shared infrastructures on a global basis to drive best practices and efficiencies with meaningful cost savings. In addition, we no longer materially invest in lines of business that we believe are not essential to our long-term growth prospects. We remain committed to our business strategy of pursuing initiatives that maintain and enhance our position as a global leader in loyalty and customer engagement solutions. The implementation of the Global Reorganization and divestiture of the domestic insurance business marked major steps in our strategic plan and ongoing transformation into a pure-play loyalty solutions company.\nWe have the following three operating segments:\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Global Loyalty. This segment consists of all of our loyalty assets globally in which we are a provider of end-to-end loyalty solutions that help clients reward, enrich, motivate and retain customers, including program design, points management and administration, and broad-based fulfilment and redemption across multiple channels.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn this operating segment, we create and manage any and all aspects of our clients' loyalty programs including program design, program management, technology platform, data analytics, points administration and rewards fulfillment. We manage loyalty solutions for points-based loyalty programs for many large financial institutions and other significant businesses. We provide our clients with solutions that meet the most popular redemption options desired by their program points holders, including travel, gift cards and merchandise. Our loyalty programs are private-label, customizable, full-service rewards solutions that consist of a variety of configurations that are offered on a stand-alone and/or bundled basis depending on customer requirements.\nWe provide and manage reward products for loyalty programs through Connexions, our wholly-owned subsidiary, which is a service provider for points-based loyalty programs. We typically charge a per-subscriber and/or a per-activity administrative fee to clients for our services. Connexions also provides clients with the ability to offer leisure travel as a subscriber benefit in a purchase environment, and a travel gift card which can be used on all travel components, including airfare, rental car, hotel stays and cruise vacations.\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Global Customer Engagement. This segment consists of our customer engagement business, in which we are a leading global solutions provider that delivers a flexible mix of benefits and services for our clients that meet customers' needs, including products that are designed to help consumers save money and gain peace of mind.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThrough our global customer engagement operations, we create and manage innovative programs and solutions that address key consumer needs such as greater peace-of-mind and meaningful savings. We provide our solutions to leading companies in the financial institution, telecommunications, retail and travel sectors globally.\nOur customer engagement solutions may be categorized in two ways: (1) revenue enhancement, which is a traditional subscription-based model and (2) engagement solutions, which is a fee-for-service or transactional based model.\nIn the revenue enhancement model, we provide incremental services for our clients to monetize their customer base. We also partner with clients to customize benefits that resonate with their brand and their customers' needs.\nIn the engagement solutions model, we help clients differentiate their products and build strong customer relations. We also bundle appropriate rewards and benefits along the lifecycle of clients' customers to create intimate, reciprocal connections that drive purchase decisions, interaction and participation over time.\nTable 101: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Legacy Membership and Package. This segment consists of certain global membership and package programs that are no longer being actively marketed but continue to be serviced and supported. This segment includes membership programs that were marketed with many of our large domestic financial institution partners. Although we will continue to service these members, we expect that cash flows and revenues will decrease over time due to the anticipated attrition of the member base in this operating segment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFactors Affecting Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nCompetitive Environment\nWe are a leading loyalty and customer engagement solutions company with value-added programs and services with a network of approximately 2,900 clients as of December 31, 2018, approximately 44.3 million subscribers and end-customers enrolled in our customer engagement and insurance programs worldwide and approximately 24.4 million customers who received credit or debit card enhancement services and loyalty points-based management and redemption services as of December 31, 2018. We believe our portfolio of programs and benefits is the broadest in the industry, and that we are capable of providing the full range of administrative services for loyalty points programs. At December 31, 2018, we offered 13 core products and services with 210 unique benefits and supported more than 4,100 versions of products and services representing different combinations of pricing, benefit configurations and branding.\nOur competitors include any company seeking direct and regular access to large groups of customers through any direct marketing channel, as well as any company capable of managing loyalty points programs or providing redemption options for those programs. Our products and services compete with those marketed by financial institutions and other third parties who have marketing relationships with our competition, including large, fully integrated companies that have financial, marketing and product development resources that are greater than ours. We compete for significant portfolios of large clients with needs that are suited to scalable servicing and that demand superior customer service and offerings for a material portion of their business. We face competition in all areas of our business, including price, product offerings and product performance. As a whole, the direct marketing services industry is extremely fragmented, while competition in loyalty points program administration is somewhat more concentrated. Most companies in the direct marketing services industry are relatively small and provide a limited array of products and services. In general, competition for the consumer's attention is intense, with a wide variety of players competing in different segments of the direct marketing industry. More specifically, competition within our business lines comes from companies that vary significantly in size, scope and primary core competencies.\nFinancial Industry Trends\nHistorically, financial institutions have represented a significant majority of our marketing partner base. Consumer banking is a highly regulated industry, with various federal, state and international authorities governing various aspects of the marketing and servicing of the products we offer through our financial institution partners.\nFor instance, Dodd-Frank mandates the most wide-ranging overhaul of financial industry regulation in decades. Dodd-Frank created the CFPB which became operational on July 21, 2011, and has been given authority to regulate all consumer financial products sold by banks and non-bank companies. These regulations have imposed additional reporting, supervisory, and regulatory requirements on our financial institution clients which have adversely affected our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, even an inadvertent failure of our financial institution clients to comply with these laws and regulations, as well as rapidly evolving social expectations of corporate fairness, could adversely affect our business or our reputation going forward. Some of our clients have become involved in governmental inquiries that include our products or marketing practices. As a result, certain financial institution clients have, and others could, delay or cease marketing with us, terminate their agreements with us, require us to cease providing services to subscribers, or require changes to our programs or solutions to subscribers that could also have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn certain circumstances, our financial institution clients have sought to source and market their own in-house programs and solutions, most notably programs and solutions that are analogous to our credit card registration, credit monitoring and identity-theft resolution programs and solutions. As we have sought to maintain our market share in these areas and to continue these programs and solutions with our clients, in some circumstances, we have shifted from a retail arrangement to a fee for service arrangement which results in lower net revenue, but unlike our retail arrangement, has no related commission expense, thereby preserving our ability to earn a suitable rate of return on the campaign.\nRegulatory Environment\nWe are subject to federal and state regulation as well as regulation by foreign authorities in other jurisdictions. Certain laws and regulations that govern our operations include: federal, state and foreign marketing and consumer protection laws and regulations; federal, state and foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulations; federal, state and foreign insurance and insurance mediation laws and regulations; and federal, state and foreign travel laws and regulations. Federal regulations are primarily enforced by the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Communications Commission and the CFPB. State regulations are primarily enforced by individual state attorneys general and insurance departments. Foreign regulations are enforced by a number of regulatory bodies in the relevant jurisdictions.\nThese regulations primarily impact the means we use to market our programs, which can reduce the acceptance rates of our solicitation efforts, impact our ability to obtain information from our members and end-customers and impact the benefits we provide and how we service our customers. In addition, new and contemplated regulations enacted by, or client settlement agreements or consent orders with, the CFPB could impose additional reporting, supervisory and regulatory requirements on, as well as result in inquiries of, us and our clients that could delay or terminate marketing campaigns with certain clients, impact the programs and solutions we provide to customers, and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe incur significant costs to ensure compliance with these regulations; however, we are party to lawsuits, including class action lawsuits, and regulatory investigations involving our business practices which also increase our costs of doing business. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\u201d\nSeasonality\nHistorically, seasonality has not had a significant impact on our business. Our revenues are more affected by the timing of marketing programs that can change from year to year depending on the opportunities available and pursued. More recently, in connection with the growth in our loyalty business, we have experienced increasing seasonality in the timing of our cash flows, particularly with respect to working capital. This has been due primarily to the consumer's increasing acceptance and use of certain categories for points redemptions, such as travel services and gift cards. These categories typically present a delay from the time we incur a cash outlay to provision the redemption until we are reimbursed by the client for the activity, and in certain instances, these delays may extend across multiple reporting periods. Redemptions for some categories, such as gift cards, have been weighted more heavily to the end of the year due to consumers' increasing usage of points in connection with seasonal gift giving.\nCompany History\nWe have over 40 years of operational history. We started offering membership products in 1973, and in 1985 began marketing insurance and package enhancement products. In 1988, we entered the loyalty solutions business and in the early 1990s, we started offering certain of our program offerings internationally.\nIn 2005, the Company was acquired by investment funds affiliated with Apollo Global Management, LLC through the consummation of the Apollo Transactions (as defined in -The Apollo Transactions\u201d).\nIn 2011, we entered into a merger agreement that resulted in the Webloyalty Acquisition and the acquisition of approximately 21% of the common stock of Affinion Holdings by investment funds affiliated with General Atlantic LLC (such investment funds referred to as General Atlantic\u201d) with the Apollo Funds continuing to own approximately 70% of the common stock of Affinion Holdings.\nOn November 9, 2015, we consummated the 2015 Exchange Offers, 2015 Rights Offering and Reclassification, each as defined and described below under -2015 Exchange Offers, 2015 Rights Offering and Reclassification.\u201d Upon consummation of the 2015 Exchange Offers, the Apollo Funds and General Atlantic ceased to have beneficial ownership of any common stock of Affinion Holdings. See Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters\u201d for information regarding the existing holders of 5% or more of the common stock of Affinion Holdings.\nOn May 10, 2017, we consummated the Credit Agreement Refinancing and International Notes Redemption, each as defined and described under -2017 Credit Agreement Refinancing and International Notes Redemption\u201d and the 2017 Exchange Offers, issuance of the 2017 Notes and 2017 Warrants pursuant to the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement and redemption of Affinion's 2010 senior notes, each as defined and described under -2017 Exchange Offers, Issuance of the 2017 Notes and 2017 Warrants and Redemptions of Other Existing Notes.\u201d On July 17, 2017, we consummated the issuance of the 2017 Notes and 2017 Warrants pursuant to the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement and redemption of the Investments senior subordinated notes and Affinion Holdings' 2013 senior notes.\nOn July 3, 2018, Affinion, Affinion Group, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the Seller\u201d) and indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Affinion, and Affinion Benefits Group, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of the Seller ( ABG\u201d), entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement\u201d) with AIS Holdco, LLC (the Purchaser\u201d), an entity controlled by investment funds managed by affiliates of Mill Point Capital Partners, L.P., pursuant to which the Purchaser would acquire the insurance division of the Company by acquiring the outstanding membership interests of ABG as set forth in the Purchase Agreement (the ABG Sale\u201d). On August 15, 2018, the Seller completed the ABG Sale pursuant to the Purchase Agreement.\nOn April 10, 2019, we consummated the 2019 Recapitalization, as defined and described below under Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-2019 Recapitalization\u201d and Note 22-Subsequent Events in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein.\nThe Apollo Transactions\nOn October 17, 2005, Cendant Corporation ( Cendant\u201d) completed the sale of the Predecessor to Affinion, an affiliate of Apollo Global Management, LLC (together with its subsidiaries, Apollo\u201d), pursuant to a purchase agreement dated July 26, 2005 for approximately $1.8 billion. The purchase price consisted of approximately $1.7 billion of cash, net of estimated closing adjustments, plus $125 million face value of 125,000 shares of newly issued preferred stock (with a fair value at issuance of $80.4 million) of Affinion Holdings, and a warrant (with a fair value at issuance of $16.7 million) that was exercisable for 4,437,170 shares of Affinion Holdings' common stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, and $38.1 million of transaction related costs (collectively, the Apollo Transactions\u201d). The warrants expired in 2011 and the remaining outstanding shares of preferred stock were redeemed in 2011.\nAs part of the Apollo Transactions, we made a special tax election referred to as a 338(h)(10) election\u201d with respect to the Predecessor. Under the 338(h)(10) election, the companies constituting the Predecessor were deemed to have sold and repurchased their assets at fair market value. By adjusting the tax basis in such assets to fair market value for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the aggregate amount of our tax deductions for depreciation and amortization have increased, which has reduced our cash taxes and further enhanced our free cash flow generation. We expect these tax deductions for U.S. federal income tax purposes to continue until 2020.\n2015 Exchange Offers, 2015 Rights Offering and Reclassification\nOn November 9, 2015, (a) Affinion Holdings completed a private offer to exchange (the 2015 Holdings Exchange Offer\u201d) its outstanding 13.75%/14.50% senior secured PIK/toggle notes due 2018 (Affinion Holdings' 2013 senior notes\u201d) for shares of Common Stock and (b) Affinion Investments completed a private offer to exchange (the 2015 Investments Exchange Offer\u201d and, together with the 2015 Holdings Exchange Offer, the 2015 Exchange Offers\u201d) its outstanding 13.50% senior subordinated notes due 2018 (the Investments senior subordinated notes\u201d) for shares of Common Stock of Affinion Holdings and (c) Affinion Holdings and Affinion International, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Affinion, jointly completed a rights offering (the 2015 Rights Offering\u201d) giving holders of Affinion Holdings' 2013 senior notes and Investments senior subordinated notes the right to purchase an aggregate principal amount of $110.0 million of International Notes and up to 2,483,333 shares of Common Stock for an aggregate cash purchase price of $110.0 million. Pursuant to the 2015 Holdings Exchange Offer, approximately $247.4 million of Affinion Holdings' 2013 senior notes were exchanged for 1,769,104 shares of Common Stock and pursuant to the 2015 Investments Exchange Offer, approximately $337.3 million of Investments senior subordinated notes were exchanged for 5,236,517 shares of Common Stock. Upon closing of the 2015 Exchange Offers, there remained outstanding approximately $13.1 million aggregate principal amount of Affinion Holdings' 2013 senior notes and $22.6 million aggregate principal amount of the Investments senior subordinated notes.\nIn connection with the 2015 Exchange Offers, Affinion Holdings and Affinion International jointly conducted the 2015 Rights Offering for International Notes and shares of Common Stock. The 2015 Rights Offering was for an aggregate principal amount of $110.0 million of International Notes and up to 2,483,333 shares of Common Stock. In connection with the 2015 Rights Offering, Empyrean Capital Partners, L.P. agreed to purchase any rights offering units that were unpurchased in the 2015 Rights Offering (the Backstop\u201d). Pursuant to the 2015 Rights Offering and the Backstop, Affinion International received cash of $110.0 million in exchange for $110.0 million aggregate principal amount of International Notes and 2,021,042 shares of Common Stock and a non-participating penny warrant (the Limited Warrant\u201d) to purchase up to 462,266 shares of Common Stock.\nUpon consummation of the 2015 Exchange Offers, the 2015 Consent Solicitations (as defined below) and the 2015 Rights Offering, Affinion Holdings effected a reclassification (the Reclassification\u201d and, together with the 2015 Exchange Offers, the 2015 Consent Solicitations, the 2015 Rights Offering and the related transactions, the 2015 Transactions\u201d) as follows. All of Affinion Holdings' then existing Class A Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the Class A Common Stock\u201d) (including Class A Common Stock issued as a result of a mandatory cashless exercise of all of its Series A Warrants (the Series A Warrants\u201d)), consisting of 84,842,535 outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock and 45,003,196 shares of Class A Common Stock underlying the Series A Warrants, was converted into (i) 490,083 shares of Affinion Holdings' Class C Common Stock, that upon conversion represented 5% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock on a fully diluted basis, and (ii) 515,877 shares of Affinion Holdings' Class D Common Stock, that upon conversion represented 5% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock on a fully diluted basis. In addition, Affinion Holdings' Series A Warrants and Affinion Holdings' Class B Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the Class B Common Stock\u201d) were eliminated from Affinion Holdings' certificate of incorporation and Affinion Holdings' Series B Warrants (the Series B Warrants\u201d) were cancelled for no additional consideration. In connection with the Reclassification, (i) the Apollo Funds received 218,002 shares of Class C Common Stock and 229,476 shares of Class D Common Stock, or 4.7% of the outstanding Common Stock on a beneficial ownership basis after giving effect to the conversion of the Class C/D Common Stock held by the Apollo Funds, and (ii) General Atlantic received 65,945 shares of Class C Common Stock and 69,415 shares of Class D Common Stock, or 1.5% of the outstanding Common Stock on a beneficial ownership basis after giving effect to the conversion of the Class C/D Common Stock held by General Atlantic.\nUpon consummation of the 2015 Exchange Offers, the Apollo Funds and General Atlantic ceased to have beneficial ownership of any Common Stock.\nThe consummation of the 2015 Exchange Offers and the 2015 Rights Offering resulted in an ownership change\u201d for the Company pursuant to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. This substantially limits our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards (including those attributable to the 2005 Acquisition) and certain other pre-change tax attributes to offset our post-change income. Similar rules and limitations may apply for state tax purposes as well.\n2017 Credit Agreement Refinancing and International Notes Redemption\nOn May 10, 2017, Affinion entered into a new credit facility (as amended, the Existing Credit Agreement\u201d) having a five year maturity with a lender, pursuant to which the lender provided term loans in an aggregate principal amount equal to approximately $1.3 billion and committed to provide revolving loans in an aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding not to exceed $110.0 million, decreasing to $80.0 million on May 10, 2018. The term loans provide for quarterly amortization payments totaling (i) for the first two years after May 10, 2017, 1% per annum, (ii) for the third year after May 10, 2017, 2.5% per annum, and (iii) for each year thereafter, 5% per annum, in each case, payable quarterly, with the balance due upon the final maturity date, subject in each case, to reduction of such amortization payments for certain prepayments. The Existing Credit Agreement also requires mandatory prepayments of the outstanding term loans based on excess cash flow (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement), if any, and the proceeds from certain specified transactions.\nThe proceeds of the term loans under the Existing Credit Agreement were used by Affinion to refinance its credit facility, which was amended and restated in May 2014, to redeem in full the International Notes, to pay transaction fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes.\nOn November 30, 2017, Affinion entered into the First Amendment to the Existing Credit Agreement, pursuant to which the parties (i) revised the Existing Credit Agreement in order for certain of the lenders under the revolving facility established thereunder to act as issuing banks in respect of letters of credit and as swingline lenders, (ii) modified certain provisions relating to the mechanics surrounding letters of credit and swingline loans, and (iii) set aggregate sub-limits for both letter of credit commitments and swingline commitments at $20.0 million.\nOn May 4, 2018, Affinion, as borrower, entered into the Second Amendment to the Existing Credit Agreement, pursuant to which Affinion amended the Existing Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the Second Amendment, the parties revised the Existing Credit Agreement in order to modify the date upon which the aggregate Revolving Facility Commitment is reduced from $110.0 million to $80.0 million. As a result of the Second Amendment, the date of such reduction was not to occur until August 10, 2018.\nOn July 16, 2018, Affinion, as borrower, entered into the Third Amendment to the Existing Credit Agreement, pursuant to which Affinion amended the Existing Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the Third Amendment, the parties revised the Existing Credit Agreement in order to (i) allow the Total Secured Leverage Ratio, for the purposes of the requirement of a 5.275x Total Secured Leverage Ratio for the ABG Sale, to be calculated net of cash received by Affinion from the ABG Sale, (ii) modify certain provisions relating to mandatory prepayments in order to allow for the application of the proceeds from the ABG Sale towards existing amortization payments such that amortization equals 0.25% per quarter through March 31, 2020, then increases to 0.625% per quarter through March 31, 2021 and finally increases to 1.25% per quarter thereafter, with remainder of the proceeds being applied to the bullet payment at maturity, (iii) modify the provision which contemplates an automatic reduction in the available revolving credit amount from $110.0 million to $80.0 million to delay such automatic reduction until May 10, 2021, (iv) create a permitted reinvestments basket which would allow for up to $50.0 million of the proceeds from the ABG Sale to be retained, subject to certain restrictions, including the requirement that such proceeds be held in a segregated account subject to the sole control of administrative agent, which shall only be released to Affinion (A) with the agent's consent or (B) if used to prepay Term Loans at 103% (with any such proceeds remaining after 9 months to be used to prepay Term Loans at 103%), (v) increase general call protection (for prepayments/acceleration not related to a change of control) to 2% upon the fourth anniversary of the closing of the Existing Credit Agreement, (vi) revise certain addbacks and Pro Forma Basis adjustments to reflect the projected change in EBITDA following the ABG Sale, (vii) reduce and/or delete certain negative covenant baskets and (viii) reduce certain material indebtedness and cross-default thresholds.\nIn addition to quarterly amortization payments, the Existing Credit Agreement required mandatory prepayments under certain conditions. First, a prepayment may be required based on excess cash flows as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement. For this purpose, excess cash flow for any annual accounting period is defined as Affinion's Adjusted EBITDA reduced by debt service, increases to working capital, capital expenditures and business acquisitions net of external funding and certain other uses of cash. Increases to excess cash flow include decreases to working capital and certain other receipts of cash. If the excess cash flow calculation for any annual accounting period is positive, a prepayment of the term loan facility in an amount equal to a percentage of the excess cash flow may be required. Such percentage is determined based upon the senior secured leverage ratio as of the end of the applicable annual accounting period. Second, a prepayment may be required with the net proceeds of certain asset sales.

Affinion used the proceeds of the 2017 Notes issued pursuant to the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement to pay the cash tender consideration to participating holders in the 2017 Exchange Offers.\nPreviously, in connection with the 2017 Exchange Offers, on March 31, 2017, affiliates of Elliott Management Corporation ( Elliott\u201d), Franklin Mutual Quest Fund, an affiliate of Franklin Mutual Advisers, LLC ( Franklin\u201d), affiliates of Empyrean Capital Partners, LP ( Empyrean\u201d) and Metro SPV LLC, an affiliate of ICG Strategic Equity Advisors LLC ( Metro SPV\u201d) (collectively, in such capacity, the Investors\u201d), all of whom were, at the time of the closing, or became, as a result of the 2017 Exchange Offers, Issuance of the 2017 Notes and 2017 Warrants and redemption of Affinion's 2010 senior notes, related parties, entered into an investor purchase agreement (the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement\u201d) with Affinion Holdings, Affinion and Affinion Investments, in which they agreed to purchase 2017 Notes and 2017 Warrants in an aggregate principal amount sufficient to pay all holders that participate in the 2017 Exchange Offers and elect to receive cash (the Initial Investment\u201d). Further, pursuant to the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement, if Affinion Holdings, Affinion or Affinion Investments exercised its option to redeem any of Affinion's 2010 senior notes, Affinion Holdings' 2013 senior notes and/or Investments senior subordinated notes not tendered in the 2017 Exchange Offers (the Follow-On Investment\u201d and, together with the Initial Investment, the Investment\u201d), the Company could obligate the Investors to purchase an aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes and 2017 Warrants that would yield sufficient cash proceeds to fund any such redemptions. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement, Affinion was required to pay to the Investors upon the closing of the 2017 Exchange Offers a commitment premium of $17.5 million and a funding premium of $7.4 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes and the same number of 2017 Warrants that such principal amount of the 2017 Notes would have been issued as part of the 2017 Exchange Offers, as described in more detail in Note 10-Long-Term Debt in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein.\nOn May 10, 2017, Affinion exercised its option to redeem Affinion's 2010 senior notes that were not tendered in the AGI Exchange Offer and to fund such redemption with proceeds from the Investors pursuant to the terms of the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement. As a result, on May 10, 2017, Affinion (i) elected to redeem all of its outstanding $205.3 million aggregate principal amount of Affinion's 2010 senior notes on May 15, 2017 at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, (ii) irrevocably deposited sufficient funds received from the Investors pursuant to the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement to effect such redemption with the trustee under the indenture governing Affinion's 2010 senior notes, and (iii) entered into a satisfaction and discharge agreement to discharge its obligations under the indenture governing Affinion's 2010 senior notes. Affinion's 2010 senior notes were originally issued by Affinion on November 19, 2010 in an aggregate principal amount of $475.0 million and bore interest at 7.875% per annum. The redemption of Affinion's 2010 senior notes was consummated on May 15, 2017.\nAccordingly, on May 10, 2017, Affinion issued approximately $532.6 million aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes and Affinion Holdings issued 2017 Warrants to purchase 3,974,581 shares of Existing Common Stock, of which (i) approximately $295.3 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes and 2017 Warrants to purchase 1,172,747 shares of Existing Common Stock were issued to participating holders (including the Investors) in the 2017 Exchange Offers, including $262.8 million of the 2017 Notes and 2017 Warrants to purchase 1,053,871 shares of Existing Common Stock issued to related parties, and (ii) approximately $237.3 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes and 2017 Warrants to purchase 2,801,834 shares of Existing Common Stock were issued, including all of the 2017 Notes and 2017 Warrants to purchase 2,791,475 shares of Existing Common Stock issued to the Investors, all of whom are related parties, pursuant to the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement to fund the cash consideration payable in the 2017 Exchange Offers and the cash redemption price for the balance of Affinion's 2010 senior notes that were not exchanged or tendered in the AGI Exchange Offer and to pay the commitment premium and funding premium under the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement. The 2017 Warrants received by the Investors on May 10, 2017, represented approximately 26.7% of the pro forma fully diluted ownership of Affinion Holdings after giving effect to issuances pursuant to the 2017 Exchange Offers and the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement, but without giving effect to options and restricted stock units granted under Affinion Holdings' management compensation and incentive plans. The number of shares of Existing Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the 2017 Warrants, as described herein, reflects the application of the anti-dilution protections of the 2017 Warrants issued in the 2017 Exchange Offers and pursuant to the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement (other than the 2017 Warrants issued as part of the funding premium) that are triggered by the issuance of 2017 Warrants as part of the funding premium.\nOn June 13, 2017, (i) Affinion Holdings exercised its option to redeem the $11.5 million in aggregate principal amount of Affinion Holdings' 2013 senior notes that were not tendered in the Holdings Exchange Offer and to fund such redemption with proceeds from the Investors pursuant to the terms of the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement and (ii) Affinion Investments exercised its option to redeem the $10.2 million in aggregate principal amount of the Investments senior subordinated notes that were not tendered in the Investments Exchange Offer and to fund such redemption with proceeds from the Investors pursuant to the terms of the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement. Affinion Holdings' 2013 senior notes were redeemed on July 17, 2017 at a redemption price of 103.4375% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date and the Investments senior subordinated notes were redeemed on July 17, 2017 at a redemption price of 103.375% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. Affinion Holdings' 2013 senior notes were originally issued by Affinion Holdings on December 12, 2013 in an aggregate principal amount of $292.8 million and bore interest at 13.75% per annum in cash, or at Affinion Holdings' option, in payment-in-kind interest at 13.75% per annum plus 0.75%. The Investments senior subordinated notes were originally issued by Affinion Investments on December 12, 2013 in an aggregate principal amount of $360.0 million and bore interest at 13.50% per annum.\nOn July 17, 2017, pursuant to the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement, Affinion issued approximately $23.7 million aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes to the Investors and Affinion Holdings issued 2017 Warrants to the Investors. Pursuant to the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement, the Investors paid a purchase price of approximately $23.5 million to Affinion, which amount includes the payment of pre-issuance accrued interest of approximately $0.6 million from May 10, 2017. The 2017 Notes and 2017 Warrants issued by Affinion and Affinion Holdings, respectively, to the Investors include the funding premium payable under the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement. The 2017 Notes constitute a further issuance of, and form a single series with, the $532.6 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes that Affinion issued on May 10, 2017.\nIn connection with the 2017 Exchange Offers and the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement, and in accordance with Affinion Holdings' obligations under the Shareholders Agreement, dated as of November 9, 2015 (as amended, the Shareholders Agreement\u201d), due to the issuance of the 2017 Warrants in the 2017 Exchange Offers and pursuant to the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement, Affinion Holdings offered (the 2017 Pre-Emptive Rights Offer\u201d) to each holder of pre-emptive rights ( Pre-Emptive Rights Holder\u201d) the right to purchase with cash up to such Pre-Emptive Rights Holder's pro rata share (as determined in accordance with the Shareholders Agreement) of 2017 Warrants at an exercise price of $0.01 per 2017 Warrant pursuant to the 2017 Pre-Emptive Rights Offer. On July 12, 2017, Affinion Holdings issued 2017 Warrants to purchase 63,741 shares of Existing Common Stock to participants in the 2017 Pre-Emptive Rights Offer.\nThe consummation of the 2017 Exchange Offers resulted in an ownership change\u201d for the Company pursuant to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. This substantially limits our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards (including those attributable to the 2005 Acquisition) and certain other pre-change tax attributes to offset our post-change income. Similar rules and limitations may apply for state tax purposes as well.\n2018 Financing Transactions and the Second Lien Commitment Letter\nOn November 14, 2018, Affinion, as borrower, entered into the Fourth Amendment to the Existing Credit Agreement (the Fourth Amendment\u201d). The Fourth Amendment was entered into among Affinion, HPS Investment Partners, LLC, as administrative agent, the Required Lenders (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement), and for purposes of certain provisions contained therein, each other Loan Party party thereto, including Affinion Holdings, as guarantor.\nPursuant to the Fourth Amendment, the parties amended the Existing Credit Agreement, to among other things, (x) permit the immediate release of $45.0 million of the $50.0 million of the proceeds from the ABG Sale, (i) $32.0 million of which is able to be used by Affinion for working capital needs and/or to make an investment in one or more businesses, or capital expenditures or assets and (ii) $13.0 million of which will immediately be used to prepay outstanding term loans under the Existing Credit Agreement, together with the required premium in an amount equal to 3.00% of the aggregate principal amount being so prepaid and (y) to modify certain provisions in the Existing Credit Agreement in order to permit the Second Lien Facility Financing (as defined below), which will be secured on a second lien basis on the same collateral that secures the Existing Credit Agreement. In addition, the Fourth Amendment (i) authorizes the administrative agent under the Existing Credit Agreement to enter into an intercreditor agreement with respect to the Second Lien Facility Financing, (ii) provides that the prepayment or repayment of the next approximately $31.0 million in principal amount of term loans, other than regularly scheduled amortization payments, shall be accompanied by a prepayment premium equal to the greater of 3% and the prepayment premium that would otherwise have been payable in connection with such prepayment or repayment, and (iii) makes modifications to certain of the restrictive covenants contained in the Existing Credit Agreement.\nThe Fourth Amendment was conditioned upon, among other things, receipt of the Second Lien Commitment Letter (as defined below). We refer to the entry into the Fourth Amendment, the receipt of the Second Lien Commitment Letter and the transactions contemplated thereby as the 2018 Financing Transactions.\u201d\nOn November 14, 2018, Metro SPV, Elliott, Empyrean and Jefferies LLC ( Jefferies,\u201d with Metro SPV, Elliott, Empyrean and Jefferies collectively, the Second Lien Commitment Parties\u201d) delivered a commitment letter (the Second Lien Commitment Letter\u201d) to Affinion and Affinion Holdings. Pursuant to the Second Lien Commitment Letter, the Second Lien Commitment Parties have committed to provide revolving loans to Affinion under a revolving credit facility (the Second Lien Facility\u201d) in the original principal amount of approximately $20.5 million (the Commitment Financing\u201d), which amount may be increased, on or before June 30, 2019 at the option of Affinion and subject to the consent of the Second Lien Commitment Parties, by an amount of up to approximately $17.0 million (the Incremental Financing\u201d and, together with the Commitment Financing, the Second Lien Facility Financing\u201d), subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Second Lien Commitment Letter. Pursuant to the Second Lien Commitment Letter, on the closing date of the Second Lien Facility the Second Lien Commitment Parties will be paid an upfront closing fee in an amount equal to 12% of the amount of the Commitment Financing (which at Affinion's option, may be paid in the form of original issue discount). The Second Lien Commitment Parties will also be entitled to be paid the closing fee upon an Incremental Financing if consummated within a certain time period.\nCertain of the Second Lien Commitment Parties owned more than 5.0% of the outstanding common stock of Affinion Holdings. Accordingly, as a condition to Affinion and Affinion Holdings entering into the Second Lien Facility and other documents relating to the Second Lien Facility, such transactions with 5.0% or more holders of common stock must be approved by holders of at least 66-2/3% of the outstanding common stock of Affinion Holdings pursuant to the terms of the shareholders agreement between Affinion Holdings and the stockholders party thereto, dated as of November 9, 2015, as amended (the Shareholders Agreement\u201d). On November 14, 2018, in connection with the Second Lien Commitment Letter, certain stockholders representing greater than 66-2/3% of Affinion Holdings' common stock had delivered a written consent (the November 2018 Supermajority Stockholder Consent\u201d) approving the transactions contemplated by the Second Lien Commitment Letter. Pursuant to Regulation 14C under the Exchange Act and Section 228(e) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, on November 26, 2018, Affinion Holdings filed a definitive information statement on Schedule 14C (the Information Statement\u201d) to provide notice of the entry into the November 2018 Supermajority Stockholder Consent.\nPursuant to the Second Lien Credit Facility Commitment Letter, if funded, the Second Lien Facility will be secured on a second lien basis on the same collateral that secures the Existing Credit Agreement and will be guaranteed by Affinion Holdings and each subsidiary of Affinion that guarantees the Existing Credit Agreement. The Second Lien Facility will mature 91 days after the maturity date of the Existing Credit Agreement, but prior to the maturity of the 2017 Notes. The Second Lien Facility will contain substantially the same representations and warranties, covenants and events of default as those in the Existing Credit Agreement, subject to certain exceptions. Interest will be payable on the Second Lien Facility at the rate of 12.00% per annum payable in kind. Each of the Second\nLien Commitment Parties have agreed to provide the Second Lien Facility contemplated by the Second Lien Credit Facility Commitment; provided that, the Second Lien Commitment Parties have agreed that upon consummation of the 2019 Rights Offering, the Second Lien Commitment Parties will be entitled to (i) a repayment in cash equal to the actual amount funded in cash by such Second Lien Commitment Party under the Second Lien Facility, the amount of all interest actually paid in kind, accrued and unpaid interest, and the amount of all customary indemnity and expense reimbursement obligations due under the documentation for the Second Lien Facility, (ii) a repayment of amounts equal to the Closing Fee (as defined in the Second Lien Commitment Letter) in the form of New Notes (as defined below), (iii) a repayment of amounts equal to the Early Termination Fee (as defined in the Second Lien Commitment Letter) in the form of New Notes and (iv) the payment of any other fees, premiums or amounts (if any) owing to the Second Lien Commitment Parties under the Second Lien Facility in the form of New Notes (the repayment provisions specified in clauses (i) - (iv) collectively referred to as the Satisfaction and Discharge\u201d).\nThe Company had the right, but not the obligation, to enter into the Second Lien Facility prior to the closing of the 2019 Recapitalization. The Company did not exercise such right and accordingly did not enter into the Second Lien Facility.\n2019 Recapitalization\nOn March 4, 2019, noteholders of Affinion's outstanding 2017 Notes, which collectively held, as of such date, approximately $647 million (95%) aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 2017 Notes ( Consenting Noteholders\u201d), and the lenders holding approximately $904 million (96%) aggregate principal amount of the outstanding term loans and revolving loans under the Existing Credit Agreement (as defined below) (the Consenting Lenders\u201d and together, with the Consenting Noteholders and the Second Lien Commitment Parties, the Consenting Stakeholders\u201d) entered into an amended and restated support agreement (the Support Agreement\u201d) with Affinion Holdings, Affinion and certain other subsidiaries of the Company. Among other things, the Support Agreement contemplated (i) a private offer to exchange (the 2019 Exchange Offer\u201d) outstanding 2017 Notes for shares of Affinion Holdings' Class M common stock, par value $0.01 per share ( Class M Common Stock\u201d), which shares of Class M Common Stock were converted immediately following the consummation of the 2019 Exchange Offer as a result of the Merger (as described below) into shares of common stock ( New Common Stock\u201d), par value $0.000001 per share, of Affinion Holdings as the surviving entity, (ii) entry into the Amended Credit Agreement, (iii) a rights offering (the 2019 Rights Offering\u201d) giving tendering holders of the 2017 Notes and certain holders of Existing Common Stock the right to purchase an aggregate principal amount of $300.0 million of Affinion's new Senior PIK Notes due 2024 (the New Notes\u201d) for an aggregate cash purchase price of $300.0 million and (iv) the Second Lien Commitment Parties agreed to waive certain conditions and requirements under the Second Lien Commitment Letter and agreed to amend terms relating to the repayment of amounts outstanding under the Second Lien Facility and related fees, if funded, as set forth in the Support Agreement (collectively, the 2019 Recapitalization\u201d). Pursuant to the Support Agreement, each of the Consenting Noteholders agreed to tender its 2017 Notes in the 2019 Exchange Offer in exchange for the Class M Common Stock, New Penny Warrants, as applicable, and the right to participate in its pro rata share of the 2019 Rights Offering.\nOn April 10, 2019, Affinion Holdings completed the 2019 Recapitalization. To the extent that the issuance of New Common Stock to any investor or group of investors (whether as a result of participation in the 2019 Exchange Offer, the Pre-Emptive Rights Offer or pursuant to the Investor Purchase Agreement (as defined below)) would require the consent of, or notice to, any governmental authority (including the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority), and such consent or notice has not been obtained or delivered prior to the settlement of the 2019 Exchange Offer, new penny warrants ( New Penny Warrants\u201d) were issued in lieu of shares of New Common Stock. Pursuant to the 2019 Exchange Offer, approximately $670.8 million of the 2017 Notes were exchanged for 725,678 shares of New Common Stock and 10,522,940 New Penny Warrants. Upon closing of the 2019 Exchange Offer, there remained outstanding approximately $10.7 million aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes. Previously, on March 20, 2019, Affinion entered into Supplemental Indenture No. 1 (the Supplemental Indenture\u201d) between Affinion and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee (the 2017 Notes Trustee\u201d), to the indenture, dated as of May 10, 2017 (the 2017 Notes Indenture\u201d), among Affinion, the subsidiary guarantors named therein and the 2017 Notes Trustee, relating to the 2017 Notes. The Supplemental Indenture, which became operative on April 10, 2019, amended the 2017 Notes Indenture by (a) eliminating substantially all of the restrictive covenants, (b) making amendments to certain existing terms and (c) eliminating certain events of default and related provisions contained in the 2017 Notes Indenture.\nAs part of the 2019 Recapitalization, Affinion Holdings and Affinion jointly conducted the 2019 Rights Offering. The 2019 Rights Offering was for an aggregate principal amount of $300.0 million of New Notes. In connection with the 2019 Rights Offering, affiliates of Elliott Management Corporation ( Elliott\u201d), Metro SPV LLC, an affiliate of ICG Strategic Equity Advisors LLC ( Metro SPV\u201d), Mudrick Capital Management, LP ( Mudrick\u201d), affiliates of Empyrean Capital Partners, L.P. ( Empyrean\u201d) and Corbin Capital Partners, L.P. (collectively, in such capacity, the Financing Parties\u201d) entered into the amended and restated investor purchase agreement (the Investor Purchase Agreement\u201d) with Affinion Holdings and Affinion, whereby the Financing Parties (or affiliates of the Financing Parties) agreed to purchase from Affinion an aggregate principal amount of New Notes that were unpurchased in the 2019 Rights Offering. On the closing of the 2019 Exchange Offer, the Company paid the Financing Parties, in accordance with the terms of the Investor Purchase Agreement, a financing premium of (i) $57.0 million in aggregate principal amount of New Notes and (ii) New Common Stock equal to 12.5% of the outstanding New Common Stock, after giving effect to the 2019 Exchange Offer, the Merger, the 2019 Pre-Emptive Rights Offer and the payment of such financing premium (but before giving effect to any dilution from\na new management incentive plan (the New MIP\u201d) and the New Investor Warrants). Pursuant to the 2019 Rights Offering and the Investor Purchase Agreement, Affinion received gross cash proceeds of $300.0 million in exchange for $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of New Notes.\nIn connection with the consummation of the 2019 Recapitalization, on April 10, 2019, we entered into certain amendments to the Existing Credit Agreement to (i) obtain an extension of the maturity of the Revolving Facility Commitments (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) and Term Loans (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) existing immediately prior to the consummation of the 2019 Recapitalization and (ii) modify certain other provisions in the Existing Credit Agreement.\nIn connection with the 2019 Exchange Offer, on February 28, 2019, the holders of 66-2/3% of the issued and outstanding warrants (the 2017 Warrants\u201d) to purchase common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Affinion Holdings (the Existing Common Stock\u201d), issued pursuant to that certain Warrant Agreement, dated as of May 10, 2017, by and between Affinion Holdings and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, as transfer agent (the 2017 Warrant Agreement\u201d), consented to an amendment to the 2017 Warrant Agreement as a result of which the 2017 Warrants, if unexercised, were mandatorily cashlessly exercised immediately following the consummation of the 2019 Exchange Offer but immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger (as defined below). Certain Consenting Stakeholders exercised their warrants using full physical settlement, subject to, and effective immediately following, the consummation of the 2019 Exchange Offer but immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger. In addition, Metro SPV exercised for cash its Limited Warrant effective immediately following the consummation of the 2019 Exchange Offer but immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger.\nImmediately following the consummation of the 2019 Exchange Offer and the exercises of the 2017 Warrants and the Limited Warrant, AGHI Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and direct wholly owned subsidiary of Affinion Holdings ( Merger Sub\u201d), merged with and into Affinion Holdings with Affinion Holdings as the surviving entity (the Merger\u201d). The Merger was approved by the board of directors and stockholders of each of Affinion Holdings and Merger Sub. As a result of the Merger, (i) each holder of Class C Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Affinion Holdings or Class D Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Affinion Holdings (the Class C/D Common Stock\u201d) received for each share of Class C/D Common Stock cash equal to $0.01 per share of Class C/D Common Stock held thereby, (ii) each holder of Existing Common Stock, including as a result of the exercise of 2017 Warrants and the Limited Warrant as described above, received for each share of Existing Common Stock 0.089809 New Investor Warrants to be issued by Affinion Holdings (the New Investor Warrants\u201d) and (iii) each holder of Class M Common Stock received for each share of Class M Common Stock one share of New Common Stock of the surviving entity. In connection with the issuance of the Class M Common Stock, the Company and its stockholders approved amendments to Affinion Holdings' Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to create a new class of common stock, designated as Class M Common Stock,\u201d having par value $0.01 per share (the Charter Amendment\u201d) and Fourth Amended and Restated By-laws (the By-laws\u201d) to make them consistent with provisions of the Charter Amendment (the By-laws Amendment\u201d).\nPursuant to the Investor Warrant Agreement, dated as of April 10, 2019, by and between Affinion Holdings and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, as warrant agent (the New Investor Warrant Agreement\u201d), each New Investor Warrant is exercisable for one share of New Common Stock at any time, subject to required regulatory approval and filings applicable to the holder of a New Investor Warrant. In order to exercise its New Investor Warrant, a holder of New Investor Warrants will need to submit an exercise notice to Affinion Holdings, together with the exercise price equal of $67.12 per share. The New Investor Warrants will be immediately exercisable upon issuance at the option of the holders thereof, and will be mandatorily redeemable by Affinion Holdings on the fifth year anniversary of the initial issuance thereof, for $0.01 per share. New Investor Warrants will not be exercisable if the recipient of the New Common Stock to be issued upon exercise has failed to obtain any required consents or waivers from, or failed to file any required notices with, any applicable governmental agency, including the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority. The New Investor Warrants will not be entitled to participate in dividends on New Common Stock but instead will benefit from customary anti-dilution protections that result in an adjustment of the conversion price when and if dividends, distributions or stock buy-backs are effected. In addition to the anti-dilution adjustments to exercise price in the event of dividends and distributions declared and paid on New Common Stock, the New Investor Warrant has limited and customary anti-dilution adjustments for stock dividends, splits, reverse-splits, reclassifications, reorganizations and similar transformative transactions that alter, amend or modify the New Common Stock.\nUpon exercise of New Investor Warrants, such holders will be required to execute joinders to the New Stockholders Agreement (as defined below).\nThe consummation of the 2019 Recapitalization resulted in an ownership change\u201d for the Company pursuant to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. This substantially limits our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards (including those attributable to the 2005 Acquisition) and certain other pre-change tax attributes.\nThe Company is evaluating the accounting for the 2019 Recapitalization, including the treatment of debt issuance costs, for which there will be significant charges that impact future periods.\nResults of Operations\nSupplemental Data\nWe manage our business using a portfolio approach, meaning that we allocate our investments in the ongoing pursuit of the highest and best available returns, allocating our resources to whichever products, services, geographies and programs offer the best opportunities. With the globalization of our clients, programs and solutions and the ongoing refinement and execution of our capital allocation strategy, we have developed the following table that we believe captures the way we look at the businesses (amounts in thousands, except dollars per unit).\nTable 102: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Three Months Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Global Loyalty\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross Transactional Sales Volume (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 537,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 816,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,251,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,216,680\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,116,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross Transactional Sales Volume per\nTransaction (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 142.14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 188.87\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 241.37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 230.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 133.92\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Transactions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,323\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,976\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,805\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Global Customer Engagement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average Subscribers (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,414\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,627\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Annualized Net Revenue per Average\nSubscriber (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 104.96\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 103.68\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 108.44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 104.19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 103.21\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Engagement Solutions Platform Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 28,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 99,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 103,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 117,962\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Legacy Membership and Package\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average Legacy Members (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Annualized Net Revenue per Legacy\nMember (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 103.81\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 109.56\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 104.72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 107.12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 100.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Gross Transactional Sales Volume primarily includes the gross sales amount of travel bookings, gift cards and merchandise redeemed by customers of our clients' programs that we support and excludes cash redemptions and revenue generated from programming, platform, administration and other non-transactional services.

Segment EBITDA is the measure management uses to evaluate segment performance and we present Segment EBITDA to enhance your understanding of our operating performance. We use Segment EBITDA as one criterion for evaluating our performance relative to that of our peers. We believe that Segment EBITDA is an operating performance measure, and not a liquidity measure, that provides investors and analysts with a measure of operating results unaffected by differences in capital structures, capital investment cycles and ages of related assets among otherwise comparable companies. However, Segment EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under U.S. GAAP (as defined in Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein), and Segment EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. You should not consider Segment EBITDA as an alternative to operating or net income determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of cash flows, or as a measure of liquidity.\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA for each segment provides supplemental information useful to investors as it is frequently used by the financial community to analyze performance period to period, to analyze a company's ability to service its debt and to facilitate comparisons among companies. We believe Adjusted EBITDA also provides additional supplemental information to compare results among our segments. However, Adjusted EBITDA by segment is not a measurement of financial performance under U.S. GAAP, and Adjusted EBITDA by segment may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. You should not consider Adjusted EBITDA by segment as an alternative to operating or net income determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of cash flows, or as a measure of liquidity.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended

Operating Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nThe following is a summary of changes affecting our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nNet revenues decreased $24.3 million, or 3.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the same period of the prior year primarily from lower retail revenues from a decline in retail member volumes in Legacy Membership and Package. Increased growth with existing clients and launches with new clients in Global Loyalty was partially offset by the impact of the loss of a top 5 loyalty partner in the fourth quarter.\nSegment EBITDA decreased $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the same period of the prior year as the impact of lower net revenues and higher general and administrative expense was partially offset by lower marketing and commissions expense and lower operating costs.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nThe following section provides an overview of our consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nNet Revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we reported net revenues of $699.8 million, a decrease of $24.3 million, or 3.4%, as compared to net revenues of $724.1 million in the same period of the prior year. Global Loyalty net revenues increased $14.2 million primarily due to increased growth with existing clients and launches with new clients, partially offset by the impact of the loss of a top 5 loyalty partner in the fourth quarter. Net revenues increased $1.8 million in Global Customer Engagement primarily from the favorable impact of foreign exchange. Net revenues in Legacy Membership and Package decreased $40.3 million primarily due to the expected attrition of legacy members, including those from our large financial institution partners, principally due to the cessation of new marketing campaigns and terminated programs with those partners as a result of the regulatory issues that have negatively impacted these partners. We expect this downward trend in net revenues related to our financial institution partners to continue for the foreseeable future. Net revenues further decreased from lower package revenue primarily the result of lower average package members.\nMarketing and Commissions Expense. Marketing and commissions expense decreased $30.7 million, or 17.7%, to $142.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $173.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Marketing and commissions expense in Legacy Membership and Package decreased $16.9 million primarily due to lower commissions principally due to the decline in the member base. Marketing and commissions expense in Global Customer Engagement decreased $10.5 million primarily due to lower employee-related costs.\nOperating Costs. Operating costs decreased $21.0 million, or 6.0%, to $331.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $352.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Operating costs in Legacy Membership and Package decreased $12.2 million primarily from lower product and servicing costs associated with the lower retail member volumes. Operating costs in Global Loyalty decreased $9.6 million primarily from a charge of $23.2 million recorded in relation to the cyber theft that occurred in the first quarter of 2017, partially offset by higher servicing costs related to the higher net revenues and additional investments, including the opening of a new call center.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense increased $27.9 million, or 32.5% to $113.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $85.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Corporate costs increased $24.4 million primarily due to higher employee-related costs, principally severance.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $48.2 million from $45.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily from an increase in amortization expense of $1.7 million principally the result of intangible assets acquired in 2018 as well as from an increase in depreciation expense of $1.2 million principally the result of an increase in capitalized software put into service.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased $54.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of restructuring our debt on May 10, 2017, whereby we entered into the Existing Credit Agreement for term loans totaling $1.34 billion and revolving loans. The proceeds were used to refinance our existing senior secured credit facility and redeem in full our outstanding International Notes. We also completed a private offer to exchange or repurchase Affinion's 2010 senior notes, Affinion Holdings' 2013 senior notes and the Investments senior subordinated notes for the 2017 Notes and 2017 Warrants to acquire Existing Common Stock. The new debt issues are at higher principal amounts with associated higher interest rates.\nGain (Loss) on Extinguishment of Debt. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a loss in the amount of $32.0 million as a result of the prepayment of long-term debt immediately following the closing of the ABG Sale.\nIncome Tax Benefit. Income tax benefit decreased $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to the estimated decrease in the state and foreign deferred tax provisions, partially offset by an increase in the current state and foreign tax provisions and an increase in the federal deferred tax provision for the same period.\nThe Company's effective income tax rates for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were 15.8% and 37.2%, respectively. The difference in the effective tax rates for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is primarily a result of the change in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the TCJA\u201d), coupled with the increase in the loss before income taxes and non-controlling interest from $73.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $171.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, and a decrease in the income tax benefit from $27.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $27.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Company's tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amount of income it earns in those jurisdictions. It is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year, but are not consistent from year to year. The requirement to maintain valuation allowances also had an impact on the difference in the Company's effective tax rates.\nIncome (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, net of tax. Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax increased $426.3 million to $447.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $21.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to a gain on sale, net of tax of $443.0 million recorded upon completion of the sale of the domestic insurance business, partially offset by a decrease in income from discontinued operations, net of tax of $16.7 million due to the timing of the closing of the sale of the domestic insurance business.\nOperating Segment Results\nNet revenues, Segment EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA by

Net revenues from Global Loyalty increased $14.2 million, or 6.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $239.3 million as compared to $225.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to increased growth with existing clients and launches with new clients, partially offset by the impact of the loss of a top 5 loyalty partner in the fourth quarter.\nSegment EBITDA increased $23.2 million, or 36.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of a charge of $23.2 million recorded in relation to the cyber theft that occurred in the first quarter of 2017. The impact of higher net revenues principally driven by growth with existing clients and launches with new clients was offset by the impact of the loss of a top 5 loyalty partner in the fourth quarter as well as by higher servicing costs.\nGlobal Customer Engagement. Global Customer Engagement net revenues increased $1.8 million, or 0.5%, to $361.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $359.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Net revenues increased $5.0 million from the favorable impact of foreign exchange. On a currency consistent basis, net revenues decreased $3.2 million.\nSegment EBITDA increased $6.3 million, or 11.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of an increase in net revenues of $1.8 million and a decrease in operating expenses of $4.3 million, principally due to lower employee-related costs.\nLegacy Membership and Package. Legacy Membership and Package net revenues decreased $40.3 million, or 28.8%, to $99.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $139.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Net revenues decreased primarily from the expected attrition of legacy members, including those from our large financial institution partners, principally due to the cessation of new marketing campaigns and terminated programs with those partners as a result of the regulatory issues that have negatively impacted such partners. We expect this downward trend in net revenues related to our financial institution partners to continue for the foreseeable future. Net revenues further decreased from lower package revenue primarily the result of lower average package members.\nSegment EBITDA decreased $5.2 million, or 13.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Segment EBITDA decreased as the impact from the lower net revenues of $40.3 million was partially offset by lower marketing and commissions expense of $16.9 million, lower operating costs of $12.2 million and lower general and administrative expense of $6.2 million. The decrease in marketing and commissions expense was primarily due to lower commissions principally due to the decline in the member base. The decrease in operating costs was the result of lower product and servicing costs related to the decrease in net revenues. The decrease in general and administrative expense was primarily due to cost saving initiatives and lower fees related to certain legal matters.\nCorporate. Corporate costs include certain departmental service costs such as human resources, legal, corporate finance and accounting functions and unallocated portions of information technology. Expenses such as professional fees related to debt financing activities and stock compensation costs are also recorded in corporate. Corporate costs increased $28.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to higher employee-related costs, principally

changes affecting our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nNet revenues decreased $17.9 million, or 2.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period of the prior year primarily the result of lower retail revenues from a decline in retail member volumes in Legacy Membership and Package, lower revenue in Global Loyalty primarily from the loss of a key client in 2015, and lower revenue in Global Customer Engagement primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, as well as the timing of marketing campaign launches and product launches with new clients.\nSegment EBITDA decreased $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period of the prior year as the impact of lower net revenues and higher operating costs was partially offset by lower marketing and commissions expense and general and administrative expense.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nThe following section provides an overview of our consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNet Revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2017 we reported net revenues of $724.1 million, a decrease of $17.9 million, or 2.4%, as compared to net revenues of $742.0 million in the comparable period of 2016. Global Loyalty net revenues increased $58.1 million primarily due to increased growth with existing clients and launches with new clients. Net revenues decreased $27.0 million in Global Customer Engagement primarily from lower net revenues in our engagement solutions business, which was principally due to the timing of product launches with new clients, lower revenue in our revenue enhancement business and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $4.2 million. Net revenues in Legacy Membership and Package decreased $50.0 million primarily due to the expected attrition of legacy members, including those from our large financial institution partners, principally due to the cessation of new marketing campaigns and terminated programs with those partners as a result of the regulatory issues that have negatively impacted these partners. We expect this downward trend in net revenues related to our financial institution partners to continue for the foreseeable future. Net revenues further decreased from lower package revenue primarily the result of lower average package members.\nMarketing and Commissions Expense. Marketing and commissions expense decreased $27.3 million, or 13.6%, to $173.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $200.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Marketing and commissions expense in Global Customer Engagement decreased $12.5 million primarily due to lower volumes partially offset by higher commissions resulting from a migration of certain partner commission arrangements from traditional bounty to advance commissions whereby the partner has the potential for additional revenue sharing. Marketing and commissions expense in Legacy Membership and Package decreased $17.2 million primarily due to lower commissions principally due to the decline in the member base.\nOperating Costs. Operating costs increased $33.9 million, or 10.6%, to $352.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $318.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Operating costs in Global Loyalty increased $49.5 million primarily from higher servicing costs related to the higher net revenues, including the opening of a new call center in the fourth quarter, and a charge of $23.2 million recorded in relation to the cyber theft that occurred in the first quarter of 2017. The charge includes costs associated with customer remediation of the cyber theft and costs related to a commercial dispute with a gift card provider. An insurance claim related to the cyber theft is currently being pursued with our carriers and we expect a recovery in a future period which will be recorded when realizable. Operating costs in Legacy Membership and Package decreased $12.8 million primarily from lower product and servicing costs associated with the lower retail member volumes.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense decreased $23.3 million, or 21.4% to $85.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $109.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. General and administrative expense in Legacy Membership and Package decreased $18.5 million primarily due to lower reserves and fees related to certain legal matters. Corporate costs decreased $8.6 million primarily due to cost savings initiatives, lower employee incentive plan costs and the favorable impact of unrealized foreign exchange on intercompany borrowings. General and administrative expense in Global Customer Engagement increased $5.8 million primarily due to higher professional fees and provisions recorded related to the collectability of certain customer receivables.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $10.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $45.3 million from $55.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily from a decrease in depreciation expense of $5.3 million principally the result of fully depreciating significant capital projects in 2017. In addition, amortization expense decreased by $4.7 million related to lower amortization of intangible assets acquired in various acquisitions, principally member relationships, which are amortized on an accelerated basis.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased $68.0 million, or 90.9% to $142.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $74.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as a result of restructuring our debt on May 10, 2017, whereby we entered into the Existing Credit Agreement for term loans totaling $1.34 billion and revolving loans. The proceeds were used to refinance our existing senior secured credit facility and redeem in full our outstanding International Notes. We also completed a private offer to exchange or repurchase Affinion's 2010 senior notes, Affinion Holdings' 2013 senior notes and the Investments senior subordinated notes for the 2017 Notes and 2017 Warrants to acquire Existing Common Stock. The new debt issues are at higher principal amounts with associated higher interest rates.\nGain on Extinguishment of Debt. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a gain in the amount of $3.5 million as a result of restructuring our debt on May 10, 2017 and July 17, 2017.\nIncome Tax Benefit (Provision). Income tax expense decreased $30.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the SAB 118 estimated decrease in the federal and state deferred tax provisions related to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and a decrease in the current foreign and federal tax provisions, partially offset by an increase in the current federal and state tax provisions and the foreign deferred tax provision for the same period.\nThe Company's effective income tax rates for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were 37.2% and (19.8)%, respectively. The difference in the effective tax rates for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is primarily a result of the increase in the loss from continuing operations before income taxes to $73.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $16.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and the change in the income tax provision from $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to an income tax benefit of $27.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflects the estimated impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of $25.5 million which includes the impact on deferred taxes of the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate to 21% and the impact on our valuation allowance assessment. The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2017 also includes the impact on the state tax provision for those states with current conformity to the Internal Revenue Code. The Company's tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amount of income it earns in those jurisdictions. It is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year, but are not consistent from year to year. In addition to the state and foreign income taxes, the requirement to maintain valuation allowances had the most significant impact on the difference between the Company's effective tax rate and the former statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of 35%.\nIncome (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, net of tax. Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax decreased $15.1 million to $21.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $36.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to increased interest expense, principally driven by higher interest rates as a result of restructuring our debt on May 10, 2017 and due to an increased income tax provision, principally due to an increase in taxable income as a result of intra-period allocation requirements under U.S. GAAP.\nOperating Segment Results\nNet revenues, Segment EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA by operating

Net revenues from Global Loyalty increased $58.1 million, or 34.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $225.1 million as compared to $167.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to increased growth with existing clients and launches with new clients.\nSegment EBITDA increased $7.6 million, or 13.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, as the impact of the higher net revenue was partially offset by higher servicing costs, including the opening of a new call center in the fourth quarter, and a charge of $23.2 million recorded in relation to the cyber theft that occurred in the first quarter of 2017. The charge includes costs associated with customer remediation of the cyber theft and costs related to a commercial dispute with a gift card provider. An insurance claim related to the cyber theft is currently being pursued with our carriers and we expect a recovery in a future period which will be recorded when realizable.\nGlobal Customer Engagement. Global Customer Engagement net revenues decreased $27.0 million, or 7.0%, to $359.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $386.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net revenues decreased $4.2 million from the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. On a currency consistent basis, net revenues decreased $22.8 million primarily from lower net revenues in our engagement solutions business principally due to the timing of product launches with new clients, as well as lower revenue in our revenue enhancement business.\nSegment EBITDA decreased $15.4 million, or 21.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 as the lower net revenues of $27.0 million and higher general and administrative expense of $5.8 million were partially offset by lower marketing and commissions expense of $12.5 million and lower operating costs of $4.9 million. The lower marketing and commissions expense was primarily attributable to lower volumes partially offset by higher commissions resulting from a migration of certain partner commission arrangements from traditional bounty to advance commissions whereby the partner has the potential for additional revenue sharing. The lower operating costs were primarily related to lower product costs and the favorable impact of foreign exchange. The higher general and administrative expense was primarily due to higher professional fees and provisions recorded related to the collectability of certain customer receivables.\nLegacy Membership and Package. Legacy Membership and Package net revenues decreased $50.1 million, or 26.4%, to $139.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $189.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net revenues decreased primarily from the expected attrition of legacy members, including those from our large financial institution partners, principally due to the cessation of new marketing campaigns and terminated programs with those partners as a result of the regulatory issues that have negatively impacted such partners. We expect this downward trend in net revenues related to our financial institution partners to continue for the foreseeable future. Net revenues further decreased from lower package revenue primarily the result of lower average package members.\nSegment EBITDA decreased $1.2 million, or 2.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Segment EBITDA decreased as the impact from the lower net revenues of $50.1 million was partially offset by lower marketing and commissions expense of $17.2 million, lower operating costs of $12.8 million and lower general and administrative expense of $18.5 million. The lower marketing and commissions expense was primarily due to lower commissions principally due to the decline in the member base. The lower operating costs are the result of lower product and servicing costs related to the lower revenue. The lower general and administrative expense was primarily due to lower reserves and fees related to certain legal matters.\nCorporate. Corporate costs include certain departmental service costs such as human resources, legal, corporate finance and accounting functions and unallocated portions of information technology. Expenses such as professional fees related to debt financing activities and stock compensation costs are also recorded in corporate. Corporate costs decreased $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily the result of cost savings initiatives, lower employee incentive plan costs and the favorable impact of unrealized foreign exchange on intercompany borrowings.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nFinancial Condition - December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017\nTable 114: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 682.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 766.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (84.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,939.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,324.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (385.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total deficit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,257.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,557.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 300.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal assets decreased $84.9 million, primarily due to decreases in current assets held for sale and non-current assets held for sale of $46.0 million and $83.3 million, respectively, from the completion of the ABG Sale, partially offset by an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $45.2 million principally due to the retention of a portion of sale proceeds from the ABG Sale.\nTotal liabilities decreased $385.1 million, primarily due to the repayment of $466.7 million of long-term debt immediately following the closing of the ABG Sale and decreases in current liabilities held for sale and non-current liabilities held for sale of $49.1 million and $7.6 million, respectively, from the completion of the ABG Sale, partially offset by payment-in-kind interest of $86.2 million and additional borrowings of $45.0 million under the Company's revolving credit facility.\nTotal deficit decreased $300.2 million, primarily due to net income of $302.1 million, the retained deficit impact of a change in accounting policy of $1.6 million and share based compensation of $1.7 million, partially offset by the impact of currency translation adjustment of $5.4 million.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity on both a short-term and long-term basis are cash on hand and cash generated through operating and financing activities. Our primary cash needs are to service our indebtedness and for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. Many of the Company's significant costs are variable in nature, including marketing and commissions. The Company has a great degree of flexibility in the amount and timing of marketing expenditures and focuses its marketing expenditures on its most profitable marketing opportunities. Commissions correspond directly with revenue generated and have been decreasing as a percentage of revenue over the last several years.\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 205-40, Going Concern, management has the responsibility to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date that these consolidated financial statements are issued. In connection therewith, management evaluated relevant conditions and events known at the date these consolidated financial statements were issued, including the consummation of the 2019 Recapitalization (as defined below) which resulted in, among other effects (i) an approximately $39.3 million reduction in estimated cash interest costs for 2019, (ii) $27.3 million of additional liquidity upon closing, (iii) the elimination of principal amortization payments due on 2019 Term Loans (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) through December 31, 2021 and (iv) certain amendments to financial covenant requirements, as well as the impact of the loss of one of the Company's top five Global Loyalty clients during 2018 and our overall liquidity needs. After consideration of these relevant conditions and events, among others, Management concluded that the 2019 Recapitalization alleviated the substantial doubt regarding the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date that these consolidated financial statements were issued that had existed prior to the consummation of the 2019 Recapitalization.\nOn February 19, 2019, a cash interest payment of approximately $22.2 million was due under the Existing Credit Agreement. On February 26, 2019, Affinion entered into a forbearance agreement (the First Forbearance Agreement\u201d) with the requisite lenders under the Existing Credit Agreement in which such requisite lenders agreed to forbear from taking any action with respect to the failure of Affinion to pay interest on the loans as required under the Existing Credit Agreement on February 19, 2019, (the Interest Payment Date\u201d) that would otherwise constitute a default under the Existing Credit Agreement and constitute an event of default under Section 7.01(c) of the Existing Credit Agreement if not paid within five business days of the Interest Payment Date until the earlier of March 5, 2019 and the occurrence of a termination event under the First Forbearance Agreement.\nOn March 1, 2019, Affinion entered into a forbearance agreement (the Second Forbearance Agreement\u201d) in connection with the Support Agreement with the requisite lenders under the Existing Credit Agreement in which such requisite lenders agreed to forbear from taking any action with respect to the failure of Affinion to (i) pay interest on the loans as required under the Existing Credit Agreement on the Interest Payment Date that would otherwise constitute a default under the Existing Credit Agreement and constitute an event of default under Section 7.01(c) of the Existing Credit Agreement if not paid within five business days of the Interest Payment Date, (ii) deliver audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 that are not qualified in any material respect on or prior to the date that is 90 days after December 31, 2018 that would otherwise constitute a default and, if not remedied within 5 days after notice from the agent under the Existing Credit Agreement, would constitute an event of default and (iii) comply with the requirements of Section 5.13 of the Existing Credit Agreement that would otherwise constitute a default and, if not remedied within 30 days after notice from the agent under the Existing Credit Agreement, would constitute an event of default, in each case until June 3, 2019. On March 22, 2019, Affinion entered into an amendment to the Second Forbearance Agreement to add to the list of specified defaults and/or events of default under the Existing Credit Agreement with respect to which requisite lenders agree to forbear from taking any action until the earlier of June 3, 2019 and certain events of termination, the failure of Affinion to make any additional scheduled payments of interest and principal under the Existing Credit Agreement through June 3, 2019.\nAffinion Holdings is a holding company, with no direct operations and no significant assets other than the ownership of 100% of the stock of Affinion. Because we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries, our cash flows and our ability to service our indebtedness is dependent upon cash dividends and distributions or other transfers from our subsidiaries. Payments to us by our subsidiaries are contingent upon our subsidiaries' earnings, but are not limited by the Existing Credit Agreement and the 2017 Notes Indenture.\nAlthough we historically have had a working capital deficit, we anticipate that, after giving effect to the 2019 Recapitalization, in future periods the reduction in cash interest payments compared to those under our prior financing arrangements will favorably impact our operating cash flows and offset the working capital deficit that will continue for the foreseeable future.\nCash Flows - Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nAt December 31, 2018, we had $99.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash on hand, an increase of $34.5 million from $64.6 million at December 31, 2017.

A net $29.6 million decrease in receivables, driven primarily by the loss of a key loyalty client in the fourth quarter of 2017 and a net $12.3 million increase in accounts payable, driven primarily by larger commissions payable in the insurance solutions business prior to the ABG Sale were partially offset by a net $15.4 million increase in other current assets, driven primarily by larger prepaid credit card charges from growth with new global loyalty clients and an $8.7 million increase in cash interest payments.\nInvesting Activities\nWe generated $479.5 million of cash from investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to a use of $38.5 million of cash during the year ended December 31, 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2018, proceeds from the ABG Sale, net of cash transferred was $517.3 million, which was partially offset by $32.1 million for capital expenditures and $5.7 million of acquisition-related payments, net of cash acquired. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we used $38.1 million for capital expenditures and made acquisition-related payments, net of cash acquired, of $0.4 million.\nFinancing Activities\nWe used $463.3 million of cash from financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $30.4 million of cash generated from financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we made payments on our first-lien and second-lien term loans of $753.8 million and $425.0 million, respectively, redeemed the International senior subordinated notes for $118.5 million, redeemed Affinion's 2010 senior notes, Affinion Holdings' 2013 senior notes and the Investments 2013 senior subordinated notes for $227.4 million and made payments on our term loan under the Existing Credit Agreement of $10.0 million. We also issued 2017 Notes for $235.9 million, received $1,303.7 million and $55.0 million of term loans and revolving credit facility under the Existing Credit Agreement and incurred $29.3 million of financing costs related to the 2017 Notes and Existing Credit Agreement.\nCash Flows - Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nAt December 31, 2017, we had $64.6 million of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash on hand, an increase of $0.8 million from $63.8 million at December 31, 2016.

As of December 31, 2018, after giving effect to the 2019 Recapitalization, we would have had approximately $1.1 billion in indebtedness on a consolidated basis, consisting of (1) $719.1 million outstanding term loans under Affinion's Amended Credit Agreement, as defined below, (2) $357.0 million principal outstanding under Affinion's New Notes and (3) $10.7 million principal amount outstanding under Affinion's 2017 Notes, as defined below and there would have been no amount outstanding under Affinion's revolving credit facility. In addition, Affinion would have had $80.0 million available under the revolving credit facility, after giving effect to the issuance of $5.0 million of letters of credit. See -Contractual Obligations and Commitments\u201d for a summary of our aggregate contractual obligations at December 31, 2018, giving effect to the 2019 Recapitalization, as if the Recapitalization had closed on December 31, 2018 and the estimated timing and effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods.\nAs of December 31, 2018, Affinion was in compliance with the restrictive covenants under Affinion's debt agreements.\nThe Amended Credit Agreement\nAffinion Holdings, Affinion, as the borrower, the lenders from time to time party thereto (the Lenders\u201d), certain subsidiaries of Affinion and HPS Investment Partners, LLC, as the administrative agent and collateral agent, are parties to that certain Credit Agreement, dated as of May 10, 2017 (as amended and/or amended and restated by that First Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated as of November 30, 2017, that Second Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated as of May 4, 2018, that Third Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated as of July 16, 2018 and that Fourth Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated as of November 14, 2018, the Existing Credit Agreement\u201d), pursuant to which the Lenders have made certain loans and provided certain commitments (subject to the terms and conditions thereof) to Affinion.\nIn connection with the consummation of the 2019 Recapitalization on April 10, 2019 (the Closing Date\u201d), Affinion entered into certain amendments to the Existing Credit Agreement (as amended, the Amended Credit Agreement\u201d) to (i) obtain an extension of the maturity of the Revolving Facility Commitments (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) and Term Loans (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) existing immediately prior to the consummation of the 2019 Recapitalization and (ii) modify certain other provisions in the Existing Credit Agreement. The Revolving Facility Lenders (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) and the Consenting Lenders agreed to extend the maturity of all Revolving Facility Loans (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) and such Consenting Lender's outstanding Term Loans (so extended, the 2019 Term Loans\u201d), as applicable, and consent to the proposed modifications with respect thereto in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Fifth Amendment to the Existing Credit Agreement (the Fifth Amendment\u201d); upon the consummation of the 2019 Recapitalization, Term Loans held by Term Lenders (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) that did not agree to extend their Term Loans into 2019 Term Loans were deemed a separate tranche from the 2019 Term Loans (such Term Loans to be referred to as the Non-Extended Term Loans\u201d), and the Revolving Facility Commitments were reduced to $85.0 million.\nThe material terms of the Amended Credit Agreement are the following:\nThe Amended Credit Agreement provides for quarterly amortization payments of the 2019 Term Loans totaling (i) for the first 3 years following the Fifth Amendment Effective Date, 0% per annum, (ii) for the fourth year following the Fifth Amendment Effective Date, 1.0% per annum and (iii) for each year thereafter 2.5% per annum, in each case, payable quarterly, with the balance payable upon the final maturity date. The 2019 Term Loans mature on April 10, 2024. The Revolving Facility Commitments under the Amended Credit Agreement mature on April 10, 2023. The Non-Extended Term Loans continue to be subject to an amortization schedule consistent with that set forth in the Existing Credit Agreement.\nIn addition, the Amended Credit Agreement requires Affinion to prepay outstanding term loans with:\nTable 117: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> 100% of the net cash proceeds of asset sales and dispositions in excess of an amount per transaction and in the aggregate per fiscal year, subject, to the ability to reinvest a portion of such net cash proceeds;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> 100% of the net cash proceeds from any insurance or condemnation event, subject to the ability to reinvest a portion of such net cash proceeds;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> 100% of the net cash proceeds from extraordinary and non-recurring cash receipts in excess of an amount per receipt;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> 50% of Affinion's excess cash flow beginning with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> 100% of the net cash proceeds received from issuances of debt, subject to certain exclusions including certain debt permitted to be incurred under the Amended Credit Agreement.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe terms of the Amended Credit Agreement allows Affinion to permanently reduce the revolving loan commitments at any time without premium or penalty, subject to the payment of customary LIBOR breakage costs, if any, and provided that the commitments may not be reduced below the aggregate outstanding amount of revolving loans and letters of credit. In addition, Affinion will be able to terminate the Amended Credit Agreement upon prior written notice, and, in some cases, be able to revoke such notice. Upon termination, Affinion will be required to repay all obligations outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement and to satisfy all outstanding letter of credit obligations. Voluntary prepayments of 2019 Term Loans will be subject to (i) a make-whole premium for prepayments on or prior to the second anniversary of the Closing Date, and (ii) a prepayment premium of 103% of the principal amount prepaid after the second anniversary but on or prior to the third anniversary of the Closing Date. Voluntary prepayments of the Non-Extended Term Loans will continue to be subject to the premiums set forth in the Existing Credit Agreement.\nThe interest rates are based on, at Affinion's option, with respect to (A) 2019 Term Loans, (x) the higher of (i) adjusted LIBOR and (ii) 1.00%, in each case plus 5.75% (of which, from the Closing Date through the third anniversary thereof, 1.75% may be paid in kind, thereafter through the fourth anniversary thereof, 1.25% may be paid in kind, and thereafter, 0.75% may be paid in kind), or (y) the highest of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.5% and (iii) 2.00% ( ABR\u201d), in each case plus 4.75% (of which, from the Closing Date through the third anniversary thereof, 1.75% may be paid in kind, thereafter through the fourth anniversary thereof, 1.25% may be paid in kind, and thereafter, 0.75% may be paid in kind), and (B) revolving loans under the Amended Credit Agreement (x) the higher of (i) adjusted LIBOR and (ii) 1.00%, in each case plus 4.00%, or (y) the highest of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.5% and (iii) 2.00%, in each case plus 3.00%. The interest rates for the Non-Extended Term Loans will continue to be the same as those set forth in the Existing Credit Agreement.\nAdditionally, if any amount payable under the Amended Credit Agreement is not paid when due, (i) all overdue amounts owing under the Amended Credit Agreement will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the rate otherwise applicable thereto plus an additional 2.0% or at the ABR plus the applicable margin plus an additional 2.0% if no rate is otherwise applicable thereto and (ii) all other principal amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the rate otherwise applicable thereto plus an additional 2.0%.\nAffinion has the option of requesting that loans be made as LIBOR loans, converting any part of outstanding ABR loans (other than swingline loans) to LIBOR loans and converting any outstanding LIBOR loan to an ABR loan, subject to the payment of LIBOR breakage costs. With respect to LIBOR loans, interest will be payable in arrears at the end of each applicable interest period, but in any event at least every three (3) months. With respect to ABR loans, interest will be payable on the last business day of each fiscal quarter. In each case, calculations of interest are based on a 360-day year (or 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, in the case of loans based on the administrative agent's prime ABR rate, and loans in any jurisdiction where the relevant interbank market practice is to use a 365 or 366 day year) and actual days elapsed.\nAffinion's obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement continue to be guaranteed by Affinion Holdings and by each of Affinion's existing and subsequently acquired or organized domestic subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions, and certain existing and subsequently acquired foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions.\nThe Amended Credit Agreement continues to be secured to the extent legally permissible by substantially all the assets of (i) Affinion Holdings, which continue to consist of a perfected first-priority pledge of all of Affinion's capital stock and (ii) Affinion and the subsidiary guarantors, including but not limited to: (a) a first-priority pledge of substantially all capital stock held by Affinion or any subsidiary guarantor (which pledge, with respect to stock of certain foreign subsidiaries, may be limited to 100% of the non-voting stock (if any) of such foreign subsidiaries and 65% of the voting stock of such foreign subsidiaries) and (b) perfected first-priority security interests in substantially all tangible and intangible assets of Affinion and each subsidiary guarantor, subject to certain exceptions.\nThe Amended Credit Agreement contains financial, affirmative and negative covenants that we believe are usual and customary for a senior secured credit agreement. The negative covenants in the Amended Credit Agreement include, among other things, limitations (all of which are subject to certain exceptions) on Affinion's and its restricted subsidiaries' (and in certain cases, Affinion Holdings') ability to:\nTable 122: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> declare dividends and make other distributions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> redeem or repurchase Affinion's or such restricted subsidiary's capital stock;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> prepay, redeem or repurchase certain of Affinion's or such restricted subsidiary's junior indebtedness;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> make loans or investments (including acquisitions);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> incur additional indebtedness;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> grant liens;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> enter into sale-leaseback transactions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> modify the terms of subordinated debt (and certain senior unsecured debt);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> enter into agreements that would restrict the ability of Affinion's subsidiaries to pay dividends;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> change Affinion's or such restricted subsidiary's business or the business of its subsidiaries;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> merge or enter into acquisitions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> sell Affinion's or such restricted subsidiary's assets; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> enter into transactions with Affinion's affiliates.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition, the Amended Credit Agreement requires Affinion to comply with a maximum Senior Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) beginning with the fiscal quarter ending on September 30, 2020.\nThe events of default under the Amended Credit Agreement include, among others, nonpayment, material misrepresentations, breach of covenants, insolvency, bankruptcy, certain judgments, change of control (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) and cross-events of defaults and acceleration on material indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of default and the acceleration of the outstanding term loans under the Amended Credit Agreement (including, without limitation, by way of automatic acceleration), the applicable prepayment premium that would have been due if the term loans were optionally prepaid at such time shall also become due and payable.\nThe New Notes\nOn April 10, 2019, Affinion issued $357.0 million aggregate principal amount of New Notes under a new indenture (the New Notes Indenture\u201d) by and among Affinion, the guarantors party thereto and GLAS Trust Company LLC, as trustee.\nThe New Notes are unsecured senior obligations of Affinion, as issuer, and each of Affinion Holdings' and Affinion's restricted subsidiaries that guarantee the Amended Credit Agreement (collectively, the Guarantors\u201d), as guarantors; provided that the obligations of any Guarantor that is organized in any jurisdiction other than the United States or the United Kingdom with respect to its guarantee is subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full in cash of all obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement (as amended, restated, amended and restated, supplemented, refinanced, replaced or otherwise modified). The New Notes will mature on October 10, 2024, at their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the maturity date.\nInterest on the New Notes accrues at a rate per annum of 18.00%. Interest on the New Notes will be payable semi-annually in arrears on April 10 and October 10, commencing on October 10, 2019. Affinion will make each interest payment to the holders of record of the New Notes on the March 26 or September 25 record date immediately preceding the related interest payment date. The New Notes will accrue interest from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from and including October 10, 2024, and will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. Interest will be payable on the New Notes by increasing the principal amount of each holder's New Notes in the register by an amount equal to the amount of interest for the applicable interest period (rounded up to the nearest whole dollar) for such holder's New Notes (the PIK Payment\u201d). Following an increase in the principal amount of New Notes as a result of a PIK Payment, such New Notes will bear interest on such increased principal amount from and after the interest payment date in respect of which such PIK Payment was made.\nAffinion may redeem the New Notes, at its option, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days' prior notice sent electronically or mailed by first-class mail to each holder's registered address, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the New Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, to the redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).\nSubject to the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement, at any time, upon a Change of Control (as defined in the New Indenture), holders have the right to require Affinion to make an offer to purchase the holders' New Notes, in each case at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the New Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, to the redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).\nThe New Indenture contains certain covenants that limit Affinion's ability and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries to, among other things, (i) incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, or issue disqualified stock or preferred stock; (ii) pay dividends or make distributions; (iii) repurchase or redeem capital stock of Affinion or any parent of Affinion or subordinated indebtedness of Affinion or any restricted subsidiary of Affinion; (iv) make investments or acquisitions; (v) incur restrictions on the ability of certain of Affinion's subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments to Affinion; (vi) enter into transactions with affiliates; (vii) create liens; (viii) merge or consolidate with other companies or transfer all or substantially all of Affinion's assets; and (ix) prepay, redeem or repurchase debt that is junior in right of payment to the New Notes. In addition, the covenants restrict Affinion Holdings' ability to engage in certain businesses or business activities. Affinion is also required to deliver financial statements of Affinion and its restricted subsidiaries.\nThe New Indenture also provides that if the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio of Affinion on the maturity date of the New Notes is greater than or equal to 8.50 to 1.00, then, in lieu of Affinion making any required principal payment on the New Notes on such maturity date, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the New Notes outstanding may, with the consent of the Company elect to convert the then outstanding principal amount of the New Notes into New Common Stock, equal to a percentage of the fully diluted equity of the Company (calculated prior to dilution from the issuance of any New Common Stock, or securities convertible into New Common Stock, in each case issued under the New MIP), calculated by multiplying (A) 99.9999 by (B) (1) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of New Notes and any additional New Notes issued under the indenture (calculated after giving effect to any PIK Payments) as of such date divided by (2) the aggregate principal amount of New Notes and any additional New Notes issued under the indenture (including 18% PIK interest paid semi-annually on such New Notes and additional New Notes from the date of issuance thereof to the maturity date).\nAs of December 31, 2018, after giving effect to the 2019 Recapitalization, the New Notes would have ranked effectively junior to approximately $719.1 million of Affinion's secured indebtedness, all of which would have consisted of borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA consists of income from operations before depreciation and amortization further adjusted to exclude non-cash and unusual items and other adjustments permitted in Affinion's debt agreements to test the permissibility of certain types of transactions, including debt incurrence. We use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our operating performance and as a basis for determining payment of bonuses under our annual incentive plan. We present Adjusted EBITDA to enhance your understanding of our operating performance. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is an operating performance measure, and not a liquidity measure, that provides investors and analysts with a measure of operating results unaffected by differences in capital structures, capital investment cycles and ages of related assets among otherwise comparable companies. However, Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under U.S. GAAP and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. You should not consider Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative to operating or net income determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of cash flows, or as a measure of liquidity.\nSet forth below is a reconciliation of our consolidated net income attributable to Affinion Holdings for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 to Adjusted EBITDA.\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Twelve\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Months Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income attributable to Affinion Group Holdings, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 302.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: income from discontinued operations, net of tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: gain on sale of business, net of tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (443.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from continuing operations attributable to Affinion Group Holdings, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (145.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 197.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax benefit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (27.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income attributable to non-controlling interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Business optimization expenses and restructuring charges or expenses (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Extraordinary or nonrecurring or unusual losses, expenses or charges (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other, net (c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA, excluding pro forma adjustments (d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 147.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of pro forma adjustments (e)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA, including pro forma adjustments (f)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 157.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td> (a)\n</td> <td> Represents the elimination of the effect of business optimization expenses and restructuring charges or expenses.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 137: <table> <tr> <td> (b)\n</td> <td> Represents the elimination of extraordinary or nonrecurring or unusual losses, expenses or charges.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td> (c)\n</td> <td> Primarily represents the elimination of (i) net changes in certain reserves, (ii) share-based compensation expense and (iii) foreign currency gains and losses related to unusual, non-recurring intercompany transactions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table> <tr> <td> (d)\n</td> <td> Adjusted EBITDA, excluding pro forma adjustments, does not give pro forma effect to the projected annualized benefits of restructurings and other cost savings initiatives.

See Note 14-Commitments and Contingencies in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein for a discussion of these contingent obligations. The above tables also do not include obligations in connection with our liabilities for uncertain tax positions as we have significant federal and state net operating loss carryforwards that we believe will be available to offset any liabilities for uncertain tax positions incurred. In addition, we refer you to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nDebt Repurchases\nWe or our affiliates have, in the past, and may, from time to time in the future, purchase any of our or Affinion's indebtedness. Any such future purchases may be made through open market or privately negotiated transactions with third parties or pursuant to one or more tender or exchange offers or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as we or any such affiliates may determine.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have not been disclosed in -Contractual Obligations and Commitments.\u201d\nCritical Accounting Policies\nIn presenting our audited consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported therein. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies related to revenue recognition, accounting for marketing costs, share-based compensation, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets and valuation of tax assets and liabilities could potentially affect our reported results and as such, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Several of the estimates and assumptions we are required to make relate to matters that are inherently uncertain, as they pertain to future events. However, certain events outside our control cannot be predicted and, as such, they cannot be contemplated in evaluating such estimates and assumptions. We believe that the estimates and assumptions used when preparing our audited consolidated financial statements were the most appropriate at the time. Significant estimates include accounting for income tax valuation allowances, litigation accruals, the fair values of reporting units, share-based compensation, assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations and financial instruments. For a summary of all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein.\nRevenue Recognition\nEffective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASC 606\u201d). The adoption of ASC 606 affected the Company's Global Loyalty, Global Customer Engagement and Legacy Membership and Package segments. Within the Global Loyalty segment, the Company has contracts with certain clients that have annual revenue-sharing and tiered pricing components (variable consideration arrangements) based on transaction volumes. Under prior guidance, revenue was recognized as the Company achieved those contractual tiers. Under ASC 606, revenue derived from these revenue-sharing and tiered pricing contracts is recognized based upon an estimate of the Company's ability to achieve those contractual tiers during each annual measurement period. Based on the Company's estimates of reaching different contractual tiers, a portion of the estimated annual revenue is deferred to a future period within the annual measurement period as these contract features provide a material right to the Company's clients. Within the Company's Global Customer Engagement segment, payments made by our customers for the provision of services were amortized over the length of the contract under prior guidance. Under ASC 606, the Company has reduced its amortization period to include only the non-cancellable period of the contract, though where the cancellation of a contract would be cost prohibitive to the customer, the Company may amortize its revenue beyond the non-cancellable period. Lastly, within the Legacy Membership and Package segment, certain members are entitled to a full membership refund throughout their entire membership term, regardless of when they cancel. Under ASC 606, revenue is recognized over time in a manner that reflects the timing of transfer of goods and services to these customers.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nIn connection with the Apollo Transactions, the Company recorded goodwill of approximately $315.3 million and intangible assets of $1,430.0 million. In subsequent years, the Company has consummated several acquisitions resulting in the recognition of additional goodwill, as well as intangible assets.\nUnder current accounting guidance, there is a requirement to assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. We assess goodwill for such impairment by comparing the carrying value of the reporting units to their fair values. Fair values of the reporting units are determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows and incorporate assumptions that we believe marketplace participants would utilize.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test for those reporting units that had goodwill recorded. Key assumptions used in the goodwill impairment test were a long-term growth rate of 2.0% growth and discount rates ranging from 10.0% to 11.0%. In 2018, the fair value of each reporting unit that has goodwill exceeded its respective carrying amount by more than 25%.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment and written down to fair value, as required by current accounting guidance. We perform reviews annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred. There were no impairments identified during each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. As of December 31, 2018, intangible assets consist of assets with finite useful lives initially recorded at their respective fair values.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are presented in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein using the asset and liability approach. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated based upon the temporary differences between the financial statements and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates. Deferred tax assets are recorded net of a valuation allowance when, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods. Decreases to the valuation allowance are recorded as reductions to the income tax provision, while increases to the valuation allowance result in additional income tax provision. The realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on estimated future taxable income. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company has recorded a full valuation allowance for its U.S. federal net deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company has also recorded valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets of certain state and foreign taxing jurisdictions.\nThe tax effects of an uncertain tax position ( UTP\u201d) taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns are recognized only if it is more likely-than-not\u201d to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on its technical merits as of the reporting date. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company recognizes changes in estimated accrued interest and penalties related to UTPs as an increase or decrease to the income tax provision, as applicable.\nThe Company recognizes the benefit of a UTP in the period when it is effectively settled. Previously recognized tax positions are derecognized in the first period in which it is no longer more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained upon examination.\nOn December 22, 2017, the TCJA was enacted into law. The TCJA significantly revises the U.S. corporate income tax laws by, among other things, lowering the corporate income tax rate to 21%, implementing a modified territorial tax system and imposing a one-time repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings and profits of U.S.-owned foreign subsidiaries (the transition tax\u201d). The U.S. federal income tax rate reduction was effective as of January 1, 2018. The Company has elected to account for GILTI (global intangible low-taxed income), as a period cost if and when incurred. The Company recorded provisional amounts related to the TCJA for the remeasurement of deferred taxes and the transition tax for the year ended December 31, 2017. During 2018 and prior to December 22, 2018, the Company finalized and completed its accounting associated with the TCJA, and no subsequent adjustments to provisional amounts were recorded.\nCautionary Statements for Forward-Looking Information\nThis Report contains forward-looking statements\u201d that involve risks and uncertainties.

The MD&A is organized as follows:\n \u2022 Overview. This section provides a general description of our business and operating segments, as well as recent developments that we believe are important in understanding our results of operations and financial condition and in anticipating future trends. \n \u2022 Results of operations. This section provides an analysis of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 to 2017 and December 31, 2017 to 2016. This analysis is presented on both a consolidated basis and on an operating segment basis. \n \u2022 Financial condition, liquidity and capital resources. This section provides an analysis of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, and our financial condition as of December 31, 2018, as well as a discussion of our liquidity and capital resources. \n \u2022 Critical accounting policies. This section discusses certain significant accounting policies considered to be important to our financial condition and results of operations and which require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in their application. In addition, all of our significant accounting policies, including our critical accounting policies, are summarized in Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein. \nOverview\nDescription of Business\nAffinion Holdings develops programs and solutions that motivate and inspire loyalty. Through our proprietary technology platforms and end-to-end customer service capabilities, we design, administer and fulfill loyalty and customer engagement programs and solutions that strengthen and expand the value of customer relationships for many of the world's largest and most respected companies. Our programs and solutions include:\n \u2022 Loyalty solutions that help reward, motivate and retain consumers. We create and manage any and all aspects of our clients' points-based loyalty programs, including design, platform, analytics, points management and fulfillment. Our loyalty solutions offer relevant, best-in-class rewards (such as travel, gift cards and merchandise) to consumers enabling clients to motivate, retain and thank their best customers. For example, our platform and technology support points-based programs for financial services, automotive, gaming, travel and hospitality companies. \n \u2022 Customer engagement programs and solutions that address key consumer needs such as greater peace of mind and meaningful savings for everyday purchases. We provide these solutions to leading companies in the financial institution, telecommunications, ecommerce, retail and travel sectors globally. These differentiated programs help our clients enrich their offerings to drive deeper connections with their customers, and to encourage their customers to engage more, stay loyal and generate more revenue for our clients. For example, we develop and manage programs such as identity theft protection, credit monitoring, savings on everyday purchases, concierge services, discount travel services and roadside assistance. \nThe Company had a domestic insurance business that served as a leading third-party agent, administrator and marketer of certain accident and life insurance solutions. As discussed further in Note 4-Discontinued Operations in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein, we completed the sale of the domestic insurance business, which comprised substantially all of our Insurance Solutions operating segment, on August 15, 2018. The divestiture of the domestic insurance business marked an additional step in our strategic plan and ongoing transformation into a pure-play loyalty solutions company.\nOur financial business model is characterized by substantial recurring revenues. We generate revenue primarily in three ways:\n \u2022 Fee for service: we generate revenues from our clients through our loyalty business by designing (management, analytics and customer experience) and administering points-based loyalty programs on a platform licensing, fee-for-service basis. We also generate revenues for desired customer engagement programs and solutions, typically through a licensing and/or per-user fee. \n \u2022 Commission or transaction fee: we earn a commission from our suppliers and/or a transaction fee from our clients based on volume for enabling or executing transactions such as fees generated from loyalty points related purchases and redemption. We can also generate revenues based on a per-subscriber and/or a per-activity commission fee from our clients for our services. \n \u2022 Subscription: we generate revenues through the sale of our value-added subscription-based programs and solutions to the customers of our clients whom we bill on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis. \nGlobal Reorganization\nEffective January 1, 2016, we implemented a new globalized organizational structure (the Global Reorganization\u201d) to better support our key strategic initiatives and enhance long-term revenue growth. This organizational structure allows us to combine similar lines of business on common platforms and shared infrastructures on a global basis to drive best practices and efficiencies with meaningful cost savings. In addition, we no longer materially invest in lines of business that we believe are not essential to our long-term growth prospects. We remain committed to our business strategy of pursuing initiatives that maintain and enhance our position as a global leader in loyalty and customer engagement solutions. The implementation of the Global Reorganization and divestiture of the domestic insurance business marked major steps in our strategic plan and ongoing transformation into a pure-play loyalty solutions company.\nWe have the following three operating segments:\n \u2022 Global Loyalty. This segment consists of all of our loyalty assets globally in which we are a provider of end-to-end loyalty solutions that help clients reward, enrich, motivate and retain customers, including program design, points management and administration, and broad-based fulfilment and redemption across multiple channels. \nIn this operating segment, we create and manage any and all aspects of our clients' loyalty programs including program design, program management, technology platform, data analytics, points administration and rewards fulfillment. We manage loyalty solutions for points-based loyalty programs for many large financial institutions and other significant businesses. We provide our clients with solutions that meet the most popular redemption options desired by their program points holders, including travel, gift cards and merchandise. Our loyalty programs are private-label, customizable, full-service rewards solutions that consist of a variety of configurations that are offered on a stand-alone and/or bundled basis depending on customer requirements.\nWe provide and manage reward products for loyalty programs through Connexions, our wholly-owned subsidiary, which is a service provider for points-based loyalty programs. We typically charge a per-subscriber and/or a per-activity administrative fee to clients for our services. Connexions also provides clients with the ability to offer leisure travel as a subscriber benefit in a purchase environment, and a travel gift card which can be used on all travel components, including airfare, rental car, hotel stays and cruise vacations.\n \u2022 Global Customer Engagement. This segment consists of our customer engagement business, in which we are a leading global solutions provider that delivers a flexible mix of benefits and services for our clients that meet customers' needs, including products that are designed to help consumers save money and gain peace of mind. \nThrough our global customer engagement operations, we create and manage innovative programs and solutions that address key consumer needs such as greater peace-of-mind and meaningful savings. We provide our solutions to leading companies in the financial institution, telecommunications, retail and travel sectors globally.\nOur customer engagement solutions may be categorized in two ways: (1) revenue enhancement, which is a traditional subscription-based model and (2) engagement solutions, which is a fee-for-service or transactional based model.\nIn the revenue enhancement model, we provide incremental services for our clients to monetize their customer base. We also partner with clients to customize benefits that resonate with their brand and their customers' needs.\nIn the engagement solutions model, we help clients differentiate their products and build strong customer relations. We also bundle appropriate rewards and benefits along the lifecycle of clients' customers to create intimate, reciprocal connections that drive purchase decisions, interaction and participation over time.\n \u2022 Legacy Membership and Package. This segment consists of certain global membership and package programs that are no longer being actively marketed but continue to be serviced and supported. This segment includes membership programs that were marketed with many of our large domestic financial institution partners. Although we will continue to service these members, we expect that cash flows and revenues will decrease over time due to the anticipated attrition of the member base in this operating segment. \nFactors Affecting Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nCompetitive Environment\nWe are a leading loyalty and customer engagement solutions company with value-added programs and services with a network of approximately 2,900 clients as of December 31, 2018, approximately 44.3 million subscribers and end-customers enrolled in our customer engagement and insurance programs worldwide and approximately 24.4 million customers who received credit or debit card enhancement services and loyalty points-based management and redemption services as of December 31, 2018. We believe our portfolio of programs and benefits is the broadest in the industry, and that we are capable of providing the full range of administrative services for loyalty points programs. At December 31, 2018, we offered 13 core products and services with 210 unique benefits and supported more than 4,100 versions of products and services representing different combinations of pricing, benefit configurations and branding.\nOur competitors include any company seeking direct and regular access to large groups of customers through any direct marketing channel, as well as any company capable of managing loyalty points programs or providing redemption options for those programs. Our products and services compete with those marketed by financial institutions and other third parties who have marketing relationships with our competition, including large, fully integrated companies that have financial, marketing and product development resources that are greater than ours. We compete for significant portfolios of large clients with needs that are suited to scalable servicing and that demand superior customer service and offerings for a material portion of their business. We face competition in all areas of our business, including price, product offerings and product performance. As a whole, the direct marketing services industry is extremely fragmented, while competition in loyalty points program administration is somewhat more concentrated. Most companies in the direct marketing services industry are relatively small and provide a limited array of products and services. In general, competition for the consumer's attention is intense, with a wide variety of players competing in different segments of the direct marketing industry. More specifically, competition within our business lines comes from companies that vary significantly in size, scope and primary core competencies.\nFinancial Industry Trends\nHistorically, financial institutions have represented a significant majority of our marketing partner base. Consumer banking is a highly regulated industry, with various federal, state and international authorities governing various aspects of the marketing and servicing of the products we offer through our financial institution partners.\nFor instance, Dodd-Frank mandates the most wide-ranging overhaul of financial industry regulation in decades. Dodd-Frank created the CFPB which became operational on July 21, 2011, and has been given authority to regulate all consumer financial products sold by banks and non-bank companies. These regulations have imposed additional reporting, supervisory, and regulatory requirements on our financial institution clients which have adversely affected our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, even an inadvertent failure of our financial institution clients to comply with these laws and regulations, as well as rapidly evolving social expectations of corporate fairness, could adversely affect our business or our reputation going forward. Some of our clients have become involved in governmental inquiries that include our products or marketing practices. As a result, certain financial institution clients have, and others could, delay or cease marketing with us, terminate their agreements with us, require us to cease providing services to subscribers, or require changes to our programs or solutions to subscribers that could also have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn certain circumstances, our financial institution clients have sought to source and market their own in-house programs and solutions, most notably programs and solutions that are analogous to our credit card registration, credit monitoring and identity-theft resolution programs and solutions. As we have sought to maintain our market share in these areas and to continue these programs and solutions with our clients, in some circumstances, we have shifted from a retail arrangement to a fee for service arrangement which results in lower net revenue, but unlike our retail arrangement, has no related commission expense, thereby preserving our ability to earn a suitable rate of return on the campaign.\nRegulatory Environment\nWe are subject to federal and state regulation as well as regulation by foreign authorities in other jurisdictions. Certain laws and regulations that govern our operations include: federal, state and foreign marketing and consumer protection laws and regulations; federal, state and foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulations; federal, state and foreign insurance and insurance mediation laws and regulations; and federal, state and foreign travel laws and regulations. Federal regulations are primarily enforced by the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Communications Commission and the CFPB. State regulations are primarily enforced by individual state attorneys general and insurance departments. Foreign regulations are enforced by a number of regulatory bodies in the relevant jurisdictions.\nThese regulations primarily impact the means we use to market our programs, which can reduce the acceptance rates of our solicitation efforts, impact our ability to obtain information from our members and end-customers and impact the benefits we provide and how we service our customers. In addition, new and contemplated regulations enacted by, or client settlement agreements or consent orders with, the CFPB could impose additional reporting, supervisory and regulatory requirements on, as well as result in inquiries of, us and our clients that could delay or terminate marketing campaigns with certain clients, impact the programs and solutions we provide to customers, and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe incur significant costs to ensure compliance with these regulations; however, we are party to lawsuits, including class action lawsuits, and regulatory investigations involving our business practices which also increase our costs of doing business. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\u201d\nSeasonality\nHistorically, seasonality has not had a significant impact on our business. Our revenues are more affected by the timing of marketing programs that can change from year to year depending on the opportunities available and pursued. More recently, in connection with the growth in our loyalty business, we have experienced increasing seasonality in the timing of our cash flows, particularly with respect to working capital. This has been due primarily to the consumer's increasing acceptance and use of certain categories for points redemptions, such as travel services and gift cards. These categories typically present a delay from the time we incur a cash outlay to provision the redemption until we are reimbursed by the client for the activity, and in certain instances, these delays may extend across multiple reporting periods. Redemptions for some categories, such as gift cards, have been weighted more heavily to the end of the year due to consumers' increasing usage of points in connection with seasonal gift giving.\nCompany History\nWe have over 40 years of operational history. We started offering membership products in 1973, and in 1985 began marketing insurance and package enhancement products. In 1988, we entered the loyalty solutions business and in the early 1990s, we started offering certain of our program offerings internationally.\nIn 2005, the Company was acquired by investment funds affiliated with Apollo Global Management, LLC through the consummation of the Apollo Transactions (as defined in -The Apollo Transactions\u201d).\nIn 2011, we entered into a merger agreement that resulted in the Webloyalty Acquisition and the acquisition of approximately 21% of the common stock of Affinion Holdings by investment funds affiliated with General Atlantic LLC (such investment funds referred to as General Atlantic\u201d) with the Apollo Funds continuing to own approximately 70% of the common stock of Affinion Holdings.\nOn November 9, 2015, we consummated the 2015 Exchange Offers, 2015 Rights Offering and Reclassification, each as defined and described below under -2015 Exchange Offers, 2015 Rights Offering and Reclassification.\u201d Upon consummation of the 2015 Exchange Offers, the Apollo Funds and General Atlantic ceased to have beneficial ownership of any common stock of Affinion Holdings. See Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters\u201d for information regarding the existing holders of 5% or more of the common stock of Affinion Holdings.\nOn May 10, 2017, we consummated the Credit Agreement Refinancing and International Notes Redemption, each as defined and described under -2017 Credit Agreement Refinancing and International Notes Redemption\u201d and the 2017 Exchange Offers, issuance of the 2017 Notes and 2017 Warrants pursuant to the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement and redemption of Affinion's 2010 senior notes, each as defined and described under -2017 Exchange Offers, Issuance of the 2017 Notes and 2017 Warrants and Redemptions of Other Existing Notes.\u201d On July 17, 2017, we consummated the issuance of the 2017 Notes and 2017 Warrants pursuant to the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement and redemption of the Investments senior subordinated notes and Affinion Holdings' 2013 senior notes.\nOn July 3, 2018, Affinion, Affinion Group, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the Seller\u201d) and indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Affinion, and Affinion Benefits Group, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of the Seller ( ABG\u201d), entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement\u201d) with AIS Holdco, LLC (the Purchaser\u201d), an entity controlled by investment funds managed by affiliates of Mill Point Capital Partners, L.P., pursuant to which the Purchaser would acquire the insurance division of the Company by acquiring the outstanding membership interests of ABG as set forth in the Purchase Agreement (the ABG Sale\u201d). On August 15, 2018, the Seller completed the ABG Sale pursuant to the Purchase Agreement.\nOn April 10, 2019, we consummated the 2019 Recapitalization, as defined and described below under Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-2019 Recapitalization\u201d and Note 22-Subsequent Events in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein.\nThe Apollo Transactions\nOn October 17, 2005, Cendant Corporation ( Cendant\u201d) completed the sale of the Predecessor to Affinion, an affiliate of Apollo Global Management, LLC (together with its subsidiaries, Apollo\u201d), pursuant to a purchase agreement dated July 26, 2005 for approximately $1.8 billion. The purchase price consisted of approximately $1.7 billion of cash, net of estimated closing adjustments, plus $125 million face value of 125,000 shares of newly issued preferred stock (with a fair value at issuance of $80.4 million) of Affinion Holdings, and a warrant (with a fair value at issuance of $16.7 million) that was exercisable for 4,437,170 shares of Affinion Holdings' common stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, and $38.1 million of transaction related costs (collectively, the Apollo Transactions\u201d). The warrants expired in 2011 and the remaining outstanding shares of preferred stock were redeemed in 2011.\nAs part of the Apollo Transactions, we made a special tax election referred to as a 338(h)(10) election\u201d with respect to the Predecessor. Under the 338(h)(10) election, the companies constituting the Predecessor were deemed to have sold and repurchased their assets at fair market value. By adjusting the tax basis in such assets to fair market value for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the aggregate amount of our tax deductions for depreciation and amortization have increased, which has reduced our cash taxes and further enhanced our free cash flow generation. We expect these tax deductions for U.S. federal income tax purposes to continue until 2020.\n2015 Exchange Offers, 2015 Rights Offering and Reclassification\nOn November 9, 2015, (a) Affinion Holdings completed a private offer to exchange (the 2015 Holdings Exchange Offer\u201d) its outstanding 13.75%/14.50% senior secured PIK/toggle notes due 2018 (Affinion Holdings' 2013 senior notes\u201d) for shares of Common Stock and (b) Affinion Investments completed a private offer to exchange (the 2015 Investments Exchange Offer\u201d and, together with the 2015 Holdings Exchange Offer, the 2015 Exchange Offers\u201d) its outstanding 13.50% senior subordinated notes due 2018 (the Investments senior subordinated notes\u201d) for shares of Common Stock of Affinion Holdings and (c) Affinion Holdings and Affinion International, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Affinion, jointly completed a rights offering (the 2015 Rights Offering\u201d) giving holders of Affinion Holdings' 2013 senior notes and Investments senior subordinated notes the right to purchase an aggregate principal amount of $110.0 million of International Notes and up to 2,483,333 shares of Common Stock for an aggregate cash purchase price of $110.0 million. Pursuant to the 2015 Holdings Exchange Offer, approximately $247.4 million of Affinion Holdings' 2013 senior notes were exchanged for 1,769,104 shares of Common Stock and pursuant to the 2015 Investments Exchange Offer, approximately $337.3 million of Investments senior subordinated notes were exchanged for 5,236,517 shares of Common Stock. Upon closing of the 2015 Exchange Offers, there remained outstanding approximately $13.1 million aggregate principal amount of Affinion Holdings' 2013 senior notes and $22.6 million aggregate principal amount of the Investments senior subordinated notes.\nIn connection with the 2015 Exchange Offers, Affinion Holdings and Affinion International jointly conducted the 2015 Rights Offering for International Notes and shares of Common Stock. The 2015 Rights Offering was for an aggregate principal amount of $110.0 million of International Notes and up to 2,483,333 shares of Common Stock. In connection with the 2015 Rights Offering, Empyrean Capital Partners, L.P. agreed to purchase any rights offering units that were unpurchased in the 2015 Rights Offering (the Backstop\u201d). Pursuant to the 2015 Rights Offering and the Backstop, Affinion International received cash of $110.0 million in exchange for $110.0 million aggregate principal amount of International Notes and 2,021,042 shares of Common Stock and a non-participating penny warrant (the Limited Warrant\u201d) to purchase up to 462,266 shares of Common Stock.\nUpon consummation of the 2015 Exchange Offers, the 2015 Consent Solicitations (as defined below) and the 2015 Rights Offering, Affinion Holdings effected a reclassification (the Reclassification\u201d and, together with the 2015 Exchange Offers, the 2015 Consent Solicitations, the 2015 Rights Offering and the related transactions, the 2015 Transactions\u201d) as follows. All of Affinion Holdings' then existing Class A Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the Class A Common Stock\u201d) (including Class A Common Stock issued as a result of a mandatory cashless exercise of all of its Series A Warrants (the Series A Warrants\u201d)), consisting of 84,842,535 outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock and 45,003,196 shares of Class A Common Stock underlying the Series A Warrants, was converted into (i) 490,083 shares of Affinion Holdings' Class C Common Stock, that upon conversion represented 5% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock on a fully diluted basis, and (ii) 515,877 shares of Affinion Holdings' Class D Common Stock, that upon conversion represented 5% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock on a fully diluted basis. In addition, Affinion Holdings' Series A Warrants and Affinion Holdings' Class B Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the Class B Common Stock\u201d) were eliminated from Affinion Holdings' certificate of incorporation and Affinion Holdings' Series B Warrants (the Series B Warrants\u201d) were cancelled for no additional consideration. In connection with the Reclassification, (i) the Apollo Funds received 218,002 shares of Class C Common Stock and 229,476 shares of Class D Common Stock, or 4.7% of the outstanding Common Stock on a beneficial ownership basis after giving effect to the conversion of the Class C/D Common Stock held by the Apollo Funds, and (ii) General Atlantic received 65,945 shares of Class C Common Stock and 69,415 shares of Class D Common Stock, or 1.5% of the outstanding Common Stock on a beneficial ownership basis after giving effect to the conversion of the Class C/D Common Stock held by General Atlantic.\nUpon consummation of the 2015 Exchange Offers, the Apollo Funds and General Atlantic ceased to have beneficial ownership of any Common Stock.\nThe consummation of the 2015 Exchange Offers and the 2015 Rights Offering resulted in an ownership change\u201d for the Company pursuant to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. This substantially limits our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards (including those attributable to the 2005 Acquisition) and certain other pre-change tax attributes to offset our post-change income. Similar rules and limitations may apply for state tax purposes as well.\n2017 Credit Agreement Refinancing and International Notes Redemption\nOn May 10, 2017, Affinion entered into a new credit facility (as amended, the Existing Credit Agreement\u201d) having a five year maturity with a lender, pursuant to which the lender provided term loans in an aggregate principal amount equal to approximately $1.3 billion and committed to provide revolving loans in an aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding not to exceed $110.0 million, decreasing to $80.0 million on May 10, 2018. The term loans provide for quarterly amortization payments totaling (i) for the first two years after May 10, 2017, 1% per annum, (ii) for the third year after May 10, 2017, 2.5% per annum, and (iii) for each year thereafter, 5% per annum, in each case, payable quarterly, with the balance due upon the final maturity date, subject in each case, to reduction of such amortization payments for certain prepayments. The Existing Credit Agreement also requires mandatory prepayments of the outstanding term loans based on excess cash flow (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement), if any, and the proceeds from certain specified transactions.\nThe proceeds of the term loans under the Existing Credit Agreement were used by Affinion to refinance its credit facility, which was amended and restated in May 2014, to redeem in full the International Notes, to pay transaction fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes.\nOn November 30, 2017, Affinion entered into the First Amendment to the Existing Credit Agreement, pursuant to which the parties (i) revised the Existing Credit Agreement in order for certain of the lenders under the revolving facility established thereunder to act as issuing banks in respect of letters of credit and as swingline lenders, (ii) modified certain provisions relating to the mechanics surrounding letters of credit and swingline loans, and (iii) set aggregate sub-limits for both letter of credit commitments and swingline commitments at $20.0 million.\nOn May 4, 2018, Affinion, as borrower, entered into the Second Amendment to the Existing Credit Agreement, pursuant to which Affinion amended the Existing Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the Second Amendment, the parties revised the Existing Credit Agreement in order to modify the date upon which the aggregate Revolving Facility Commitment is reduced from $110.0 million to $80.0 million. As a result of the Second Amendment, the date of such reduction was not to occur until August 10, 2018.\nOn July 16, 2018, Affinion, as borrower, entered into the Third Amendment to the Existing Credit Agreement, pursuant to which Affinion amended the Existing Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the Third Amendment, the parties revised the Existing Credit Agreement in order to (i) allow the Total Secured Leverage Ratio, for the purposes of the requirement of a 5.275x Total Secured Leverage Ratio for the ABG Sale, to be calculated net of cash received by Affinion from the ABG Sale, (ii) modify certain provisions relating to mandatory prepayments in order to allow for the application of the proceeds from the ABG Sale towards existing amortization payments such that amortization equals 0.25% per quarter through March 31, 2020, then increases to 0.625% per quarter through March 31, 2021 and finally increases to 1.25% per quarter thereafter, with remainder of the proceeds being applied to the bullet payment at maturity, (iii) modify the provision which contemplates an automatic reduction in the available revolving credit amount from $110.0 million to $80.0 million to delay such automatic reduction until May 10, 2021, (iv) create a permitted reinvestments basket which would allow for up to $50.0 million of the proceeds from the ABG Sale to be retained, subject to certain restrictions, including the requirement that such proceeds be held in a segregated account subject to the sole control of administrative agent, which shall only be released to Affinion (A) with the agent's consent or (B) if used to prepay Term Loans at 103% (with any such proceeds remaining after 9 months to be used to prepay Term Loans at 103%), (v) increase general call protection (for prepayments/acceleration not related to a change of control) to 2% upon the fourth anniversary of the closing of the Existing Credit Agreement, (vi) revise certain addbacks and Pro Forma Basis adjustments to reflect the projected change in EBITDA following the ABG Sale, (vii) reduce and/or delete certain negative covenant baskets and (viii) reduce certain material indebtedness and cross-default thresholds.\nIn addition to quarterly amortization payments, the Existing Credit Agreement required mandatory prepayments under certain conditions. First, a prepayment may be required based on excess cash flows as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement. For this purpose, excess cash flow for any annual accounting period is defined as Affinion's Adjusted EBITDA reduced by debt service, increases to working capital, capital expenditures and business acquisitions net of external funding and certain other uses of cash. Increases to excess cash flow include decreases to working capital and certain other receipts of cash. If the excess cash flow calculation for any annual accounting period is positive, a prepayment of the term loan facility in an amount equal to a percentage of the excess cash flow may be required. Such percentage is determined based upon the senior secured leverage ratio as of the end of the applicable annual accounting period. Second, a prepayment may be required with the net proceeds of certain asset sales. However, certain of such net proceeds will not be required to be applied to prepay the Existing Credit Agreement if they are applied to acquire, maintain, develop, construct, improve or repair assets useful in our business or to make acquisitions or other permitted investments within 12 months.\nOn May 10, 2017, Affinion International Holdings Limited ( Affinion International\u201d) (i) elected to redeem all of its outstanding $118.5 million aggregate principal amount of 7.5% Cash/PIK Senior Notes due 2018 (the International Notes\u201d) on June 9, 2017 at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount of the International Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, (ii) irrevocably deposited sufficient funds received from borrowings under the Existing Credit Agreement to effect such redemption with the trustee under the indenture governing the International Notes, and (iii) entered into a satisfaction and discharge agreement to discharge its obligations under the indenture governing the International Notes.

Interest on the International Notes was payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year, commencing on May 1, 2016. The International Notes Redemption was consummated on June 9, 2017.\n2017 Exchange Offers, Issuance of the 2017 Notes and 2017 Warrants and Redemptions of Other Existing Notes\nOn May 10, 2017, (a) Affinion completed a private offer to exchange or repurchase at the holder's election (collectively, the AGI Exchange Offer\u201d) Affinion's 7.875% senior notes due 2018 (Affinion's 2010 senior notes\u201d) for (i) new Senior Cash 12.5%/ PIK Step-Up to 15.5% Notes due 2022 of Affinion (the 2017 Notes\u201d) and new warrants (the 2017 Warrants\u201d) to acquire shares of Existing Common Stock or (ii) cash; (b) Affinion Holdings completed a private offer to exchange or repurchase at the holder's election (collectively, the Holdings Exchange Offer\u201d) Affinion Holdings' 2013 senior notes for (i) 2017 Notes and 2017 Warrants or (ii) cash; and (c) Affinion Investments completed a private offer to exchange or repurchase at the holder's election (collectively, the Investments Exchange Offer\u201d and, together with the AGI Exchange Offer and the Holdings Exchange Offer, the 2017 Exchange Offers\u201d) Affinion Investments' senior subordinated notes (the Investments senior subordinated notes together with Affinion's 2010 senior notes and Affinion Holdings' 2013 senior notes, the Existing Notes\u201d) for (i) 2017 Notes and 2017 Warrants or (ii) cash. Under the terms of the AGI Exchange Offer, for each $1,000 principal amount of Affinion's 2010 senior notes accepted in the AGI Exchange Offer, holders could elect to receive (i)(A) $1,000 principal amount of the 2017 Notes and 2017 Warrants to purchase 3.37 shares of Existing Common Stock or (B) $930 in cash.

Affinion used the proceeds of the 2017 Notes issued pursuant to the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement to pay the cash tender consideration to participating holders in the 2017 Exchange Offers.\nPreviously, in connection with the 2017 Exchange Offers, on March 31, 2017, affiliates of Elliott Management Corporation ( Elliott\u201d), Franklin Mutual Quest Fund, an affiliate of Franklin Mutual Advisers, LLC ( Franklin\u201d), affiliates of Empyrean Capital Partners, LP ( Empyrean\u201d) and Metro SPV LLC, an affiliate of ICG Strategic Equity Advisors LLC ( Metro SPV\u201d) (collectively, in such capacity, the Investors\u201d), all of whom were, at the time of the closing, or became, as a result of the 2017 Exchange Offers, Issuance of the 2017 Notes and 2017 Warrants and redemption of Affinion's 2010 senior notes, related parties, entered into an investor purchase agreement (the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement\u201d) with Affinion Holdings, Affinion and Affinion Investments, in which they agreed to purchase 2017 Notes and 2017 Warrants in an aggregate principal amount sufficient to pay all holders that participate in the 2017 Exchange Offers and elect to receive cash (the Initial Investment\u201d). Further, pursuant to the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement, if Affinion Holdings, Affinion or Affinion Investments exercised its option to redeem any of Affinion's 2010 senior notes, Affinion Holdings' 2013 senior notes and/or Investments senior subordinated notes not tendered in the 2017 Exchange Offers (the Follow-On Investment\u201d and, together with the Initial Investment, the Investment\u201d), the Company could obligate the Investors to purchase an aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes and 2017 Warrants that would yield sufficient cash proceeds to fund any such redemptions. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement, Affinion was required to pay to the Investors upon the closing of the 2017 Exchange Offers a commitment premium of $17.5 million and a funding premium of $7.4 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes and the same number of 2017 Warrants that such principal amount of the 2017 Notes would have been issued as part of the 2017 Exchange Offers, as described in more detail in Note 10-Long-Term Debt in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein.\nOn May 10, 2017, Affinion exercised its option to redeem Affinion's 2010 senior notes that were not tendered in the AGI Exchange Offer and to fund such redemption with proceeds from the Investors pursuant to the terms of the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement. As a result, on May 10, 2017, Affinion (i) elected to redeem all of its outstanding $205.3 million aggregate principal amount of Affinion's 2010 senior notes on May 15, 2017 at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, (ii) irrevocably deposited sufficient funds received from the Investors pursuant to the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement to effect such redemption with the trustee under the indenture governing Affinion's 2010 senior notes, and (iii) entered into a satisfaction and discharge agreement to discharge its obligations under the indenture governing Affinion's 2010 senior notes. Affinion's 2010 senior notes were originally issued by Affinion on November 19, 2010 in an aggregate principal amount of $475.0 million and bore interest at 7.875% per annum. The redemption of Affinion's 2010 senior notes was consummated on May 15, 2017.\nAccordingly, on May 10, 2017, Affinion issued approximately $532.6 million aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes and Affinion Holdings issued 2017 Warrants to purchase 3,974,581 shares of Existing Common Stock, of which (i) approximately $295.3 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes and 2017 Warrants to purchase 1,172,747 shares of Existing Common Stock were issued to participating holders (including the Investors) in the 2017 Exchange Offers, including $262.8 million of the 2017 Notes and 2017 Warrants to purchase 1,053,871 shares of Existing Common Stock issued to related parties, and (ii) approximately $237.3 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes and 2017 Warrants to purchase 2,801,834 shares of Existing Common Stock were issued, including all of the 2017 Notes and 2017 Warrants to purchase 2,791,475 shares of Existing Common Stock issued to the Investors, all of whom are related parties, pursuant to the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement to fund the cash consideration payable in the 2017 Exchange Offers and the cash redemption price for the balance of Affinion's 2010 senior notes that were not exchanged or tendered in the AGI Exchange Offer and to pay the commitment premium and funding premium under the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement. The 2017 Warrants received by the Investors on May 10, 2017, represented approximately 26.7% of the pro forma fully diluted ownership of Affinion Holdings after giving effect to issuances pursuant to the 2017 Exchange Offers and the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement, but without giving effect to options and restricted stock units granted under Affinion Holdings' management compensation and incentive plans. The number of shares of Existing Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the 2017 Warrants, as described herein, reflects the application of the anti-dilution protections of the 2017 Warrants issued in the 2017 Exchange Offers and pursuant to the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement (other than the 2017 Warrants issued as part of the funding premium) that are triggered by the issuance of 2017 Warrants as part of the funding premium.\nOn June 13, 2017, (i) Affinion Holdings exercised its option to redeem the $11.5 million in aggregate principal amount of Affinion Holdings' 2013 senior notes that were not tendered in the Holdings Exchange Offer and to fund such redemption with proceeds from the Investors pursuant to the terms of the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement and (ii) Affinion Investments exercised its option to redeem the $10.2 million in aggregate principal amount of the Investments senior subordinated notes that were not tendered in the Investments Exchange Offer and to fund such redemption with proceeds from the Investors pursuant to the terms of the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement. Affinion Holdings' 2013 senior notes were redeemed on July 17, 2017 at a redemption price of 103.4375% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date and the Investments senior subordinated notes were redeemed on July 17, 2017 at a redemption price of 103.375% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. Affinion Holdings' 2013 senior notes were originally issued by Affinion Holdings on December 12, 2013 in an aggregate principal amount of $292.8 million and bore interest at 13.75% per annum in cash, or at Affinion Holdings' option, in payment-in-kind interest at 13.75% per annum plus 0.75%. The Investments senior subordinated notes were originally issued by Affinion Investments on December 12, 2013 in an aggregate principal amount of $360.0 million and bore interest at 13.50% per annum.\nOn July 17, 2017, pursuant to the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement, Affinion issued approximately $23.7 million aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes to the Investors and Affinion Holdings issued 2017 Warrants to the Investors. Pursuant to the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement, the Investors paid a purchase price of approximately $23.5 million to Affinion, which amount includes the payment of pre-issuance accrued interest of approximately $0.6 million from May 10, 2017. The 2017 Notes and 2017 Warrants issued by Affinion and Affinion Holdings, respectively, to the Investors include the funding premium payable under the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement. The 2017 Notes constitute a further issuance of, and form a single series with, the $532.6 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes that Affinion issued on May 10, 2017.\nIn connection with the 2017 Exchange Offers and the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement, and in accordance with Affinion Holdings' obligations under the Shareholders Agreement, dated as of November 9, 2015 (as amended, the Shareholders Agreement\u201d), due to the issuance of the 2017 Warrants in the 2017 Exchange Offers and pursuant to the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement, Affinion Holdings offered (the 2017 Pre-Emptive Rights Offer\u201d) to each holder of pre-emptive rights ( Pre-Emptive Rights Holder\u201d) the right to purchase with cash up to such Pre-Emptive Rights Holder's pro rata share (as determined in accordance with the Shareholders Agreement) of 2017 Warrants at an exercise price of $0.01 per 2017 Warrant pursuant to the 2017 Pre-Emptive Rights Offer. On July 12, 2017, Affinion Holdings issued 2017 Warrants to purchase 63,741 shares of Existing Common Stock to participants in the 2017 Pre-Emptive Rights Offer.\nThe consummation of the 2017 Exchange Offers resulted in an ownership change\u201d for the Company pursuant to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. This substantially limits our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards (including those attributable to the 2005 Acquisition) and certain other pre-change tax attributes to offset our post-change income. Similar rules and limitations may apply for state tax purposes as well.\n2018 Financing Transactions and the Second Lien Commitment Letter\nOn November 14, 2018, Affinion, as borrower, entered into the Fourth Amendment to the Existing Credit Agreement (the Fourth Amendment\u201d). The Fourth Amendment was entered into among Affinion, HPS Investment Partners, LLC, as administrative agent, the Required Lenders (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement), and for purposes of certain provisions contained therein, each other Loan Party party thereto, including Affinion Holdings, as guarantor.\nPursuant to the Fourth Amendment, the parties amended the Existing Credit Agreement, to among other things, (x) permit the immediate release of $45.0 million of the $50.0 million of the proceeds from the ABG Sale, (i) $32.0 million of which is able to be used by Affinion for working capital needs and/or to make an investment in one or more businesses, or capital expenditures or assets and (ii) $13.0 million of which will immediately be used to prepay outstanding term loans under the Existing Credit Agreement, together with the required premium in an amount equal to 3.00% of the aggregate principal amount being so prepaid and (y) to modify certain provisions in the Existing Credit Agreement in order to permit the Second Lien Facility Financing (as defined below), which will be secured on a second lien basis on the same collateral that secures the Existing Credit Agreement. In addition, the Fourth Amendment (i) authorizes the administrative agent under the Existing Credit Agreement to enter into an intercreditor agreement with respect to the Second Lien Facility Financing, (ii) provides that the prepayment or repayment of the next approximately $31.0 million in principal amount of term loans, other than regularly scheduled amortization payments, shall be accompanied by a prepayment premium equal to the greater of 3% and the prepayment premium that would otherwise have been payable in connection with such prepayment or repayment, and (iii) makes modifications to certain of the restrictive covenants contained in the Existing Credit Agreement.\nThe Fourth Amendment was conditioned upon, among other things, receipt of the Second Lien Commitment Letter (as defined below). We refer to the entry into the Fourth Amendment, the receipt of the Second Lien Commitment Letter and the transactions contemplated thereby as the 2018 Financing Transactions.\u201d\nOn November 14, 2018, Metro SPV, Elliott, Empyrean and Jefferies LLC ( Jefferies,\u201d with Metro SPV, Elliott, Empyrean and Jefferies collectively, the Second Lien Commitment Parties\u201d) delivered a commitment letter (the Second Lien Commitment Letter\u201d) to Affinion and Affinion Holdings. Pursuant to the Second Lien Commitment Letter, the Second Lien Commitment Parties have committed to provide revolving loans to Affinion under a revolving credit facility (the Second Lien Facility\u201d) in the original principal amount of approximately $20.5 million (the Commitment Financing\u201d), which amount may be increased, on or before June 30, 2019 at the option of Affinion and subject to the consent of the Second Lien Commitment Parties, by an amount of up to approximately $17.0 million (the Incremental Financing\u201d and, together with the Commitment Financing, the Second Lien Facility Financing\u201d), subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Second Lien Commitment Letter. Pursuant to the Second Lien Commitment Letter, on the closing date of the Second Lien Facility the Second Lien Commitment Parties will be paid an upfront closing fee in an amount equal to 12% of the amount of the Commitment Financing (which at Affinion's option, may be paid in the form of original issue discount). The Second Lien Commitment Parties will also be entitled to be paid the closing fee upon an Incremental Financing if consummated within a certain time period.\nCertain of the Second Lien Commitment Parties owned more than 5.0% of the outstanding common stock of Affinion Holdings. Accordingly, as a condition to Affinion and Affinion Holdings entering into the Second Lien Facility and other documents relating to the Second Lien Facility, such transactions with 5.0% or more holders of common stock must be approved by holders of at least 66-2/3% of the outstanding common stock of Affinion Holdings pursuant to the terms of the shareholders agreement between Affinion Holdings and the stockholders party thereto, dated as of November 9, 2015, as amended (the Shareholders Agreement\u201d). On November 14, 2018, in connection with the Second Lien Commitment Letter, certain stockholders representing greater than 66-2/3% of Affinion Holdings' common stock had delivered a written consent (the November 2018 Supermajority Stockholder Consent\u201d) approving the transactions contemplated by the Second Lien Commitment Letter. Pursuant to Regulation 14C under the Exchange Act and Section 228(e) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, on November 26, 2018, Affinion Holdings filed a definitive information statement on Schedule 14C (the Information Statement\u201d) to provide notice of the entry into the November 2018 Supermajority Stockholder Consent.\nPursuant to the Second Lien Credit Facility Commitment Letter, if funded, the Second Lien Facility will be secured on a second lien basis on the same collateral that secures the Existing Credit Agreement and will be guaranteed by Affinion Holdings and each subsidiary of Affinion that guarantees the Existing Credit Agreement. The Second Lien Facility will mature 91 days after the maturity date of the Existing Credit Agreement, but prior to the maturity of the 2017 Notes. The Second Lien Facility will contain substantially the same representations and warranties, covenants and events of default as those in the Existing Credit Agreement, subject to certain exceptions. Interest will be payable on the Second Lien Facility at the rate of 12.00% per annum payable in kind. Each of the Second\nLien Commitment Parties have agreed to provide the Second Lien Facility contemplated by the Second Lien Credit Facility Commitment; provided that, the Second Lien Commitment Parties have agreed that upon consummation of the 2019 Rights Offering, the Second Lien Commitment Parties will be entitled to (i) a repayment in cash equal to the actual amount funded in cash by such Second Lien Commitment Party under the Second Lien Facility, the amount of all interest actually paid in kind, accrued and unpaid interest, and the amount of all customary indemnity and expense reimbursement obligations due under the documentation for the Second Lien Facility, (ii) a repayment of amounts equal to the Closing Fee (as defined in the Second Lien Commitment Letter) in the form of New Notes (as defined below), (iii) a repayment of amounts equal to the Early Termination Fee (as defined in the Second Lien Commitment Letter) in the form of New Notes and (iv) the payment of any other fees, premiums or amounts (if any) owing to the Second Lien Commitment Parties under the Second Lien Facility in the form of New Notes (the repayment provisions specified in clauses (i) - (iv) collectively referred to as the Satisfaction and Discharge\u201d).\nThe Company had the right, but not the obligation, to enter into the Second Lien Facility prior to the closing of the 2019 Recapitalization. The Company did not exercise such right and accordingly did not enter into the Second Lien Facility.\n2019 Recapitalization\nOn March 4, 2019, noteholders of Affinion's outstanding 2017 Notes, which collectively held, as of such date, approximately $647 million (95%) aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 2017 Notes ( Consenting Noteholders\u201d), and the lenders holding approximately $904 million (96%) aggregate principal amount of the outstanding term loans and revolving loans under the Existing Credit Agreement (as defined below) (the Consenting Lenders\u201d and together, with the Consenting Noteholders and the Second Lien Commitment Parties, the Consenting Stakeholders\u201d) entered into an amended and restated support agreement (the Support Agreement\u201d) with Affinion Holdings, Affinion and certain other subsidiaries of the Company. Among other things, the Support Agreement contemplated (i) a private offer to exchange (the 2019 Exchange Offer\u201d) outstanding 2017 Notes for shares of Affinion Holdings' Class M common stock, par value $0.01 per share ( Class M Common Stock\u201d), which shares of Class M Common Stock were converted immediately following the consummation of the 2019 Exchange Offer as a result of the Merger (as described below) into shares of common stock ( New Common Stock\u201d), par value $0.000001 per share, of Affinion Holdings as the surviving entity, (ii) entry into the Amended Credit Agreement, (iii) a rights offering (the 2019 Rights Offering\u201d) giving tendering holders of the 2017 Notes and certain holders of Existing Common Stock the right to purchase an aggregate principal amount of $300.0 million of Affinion's new Senior PIK Notes due 2024 (the New Notes\u201d) for an aggregate cash purchase price of $300.0 million and (iv) the Second Lien Commitment Parties agreed to waive certain conditions and requirements under the Second Lien Commitment Letter and agreed to amend terms relating to the repayment of amounts outstanding under the Second Lien Facility and related fees, if funded, as set forth in the Support Agreement (collectively, the 2019 Recapitalization\u201d). Pursuant to the Support Agreement, each of the Consenting Noteholders agreed to tender its 2017 Notes in the 2019 Exchange Offer in exchange for the Class M Common Stock, New Penny Warrants, as applicable, and the right to participate in its pro rata share of the 2019 Rights Offering.\nOn April 10, 2019, Affinion Holdings completed the 2019 Recapitalization. To the extent that the issuance of New Common Stock to any investor or group of investors (whether as a result of participation in the 2019 Exchange Offer, the Pre-Emptive Rights Offer or pursuant to the Investor Purchase Agreement (as defined below)) would require the consent of, or notice to, any governmental authority (including the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority), and such consent or notice has not been obtained or delivered prior to the settlement of the 2019 Exchange Offer, new penny warrants ( New Penny Warrants\u201d) were issued in lieu of shares of New Common Stock. Pursuant to the 2019 Exchange Offer, approximately $670.8 million of the 2017 Notes were exchanged for 725,678 shares of New Common Stock and 10,522,940 New Penny Warrants. Upon closing of the 2019 Exchange Offer, there remained outstanding approximately $10.7 million aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes. Previously, on March 20, 2019, Affinion entered into Supplemental Indenture No. 1 (the Supplemental Indenture\u201d) between Affinion and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee (the 2017 Notes Trustee\u201d), to the indenture, dated as of May 10, 2017 (the 2017 Notes Indenture\u201d), among Affinion, the subsidiary guarantors named therein and the 2017 Notes Trustee, relating to the 2017 Notes. The Supplemental Indenture, which became operative on April 10, 2019, amended the 2017 Notes Indenture by (a) eliminating substantially all of the restrictive covenants, (b) making amendments to certain existing terms and (c) eliminating certain events of default and related provisions contained in the 2017 Notes Indenture.\nAs part of the 2019 Recapitalization, Affinion Holdings and Affinion jointly conducted the 2019 Rights Offering. The 2019 Rights Offering was for an aggregate principal amount of $300.0 million of New Notes. In connection with the 2019 Rights Offering, affiliates of Elliott Management Corporation ( Elliott\u201d), Metro SPV LLC, an affiliate of ICG Strategic Equity Advisors LLC ( Metro SPV\u201d), Mudrick Capital Management, LP ( Mudrick\u201d), affiliates of Empyrean Capital Partners, L.P. ( Empyrean\u201d) and Corbin Capital Partners, L.P. (collectively, in such capacity, the Financing Parties\u201d) entered into the amended and restated investor purchase agreement (the Investor Purchase Agreement\u201d) with Affinion Holdings and Affinion, whereby the Financing Parties (or affiliates of the Financing Parties) agreed to purchase from Affinion an aggregate principal amount of New Notes that were unpurchased in the 2019 Rights Offering. On the closing of the 2019 Exchange Offer, the Company paid the Financing Parties, in accordance with the terms of the Investor Purchase Agreement, a financing premium of (i) $57.0 million in aggregate principal amount of New Notes and (ii) New Common Stock equal to 12.5% of the outstanding New Common Stock, after giving effect to the 2019 Exchange Offer, the Merger, the 2019 Pre-Emptive Rights Offer and the payment of such financing premium (but before giving effect to any dilution from\na new management incentive plan (the New MIP\u201d) and the New Investor Warrants). Pursuant to the 2019 Rights Offering and the Investor Purchase Agreement, Affinion received gross cash proceeds of $300.0 million in exchange for $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of New Notes.\nIn connection with the consummation of the 2019 Recapitalization, on April 10, 2019, we entered into certain amendments to the Existing Credit Agreement to (i) obtain an extension of the maturity of the Revolving Facility Commitments (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) and Term Loans (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) existing immediately prior to the consummation of the 2019 Recapitalization and (ii) modify certain other provisions in the Existing Credit Agreement.\nIn connection with the 2019 Exchange Offer, on February 28, 2019, the holders of 66-2/3% of the issued and outstanding warrants (the 2017 Warrants\u201d) to purchase common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Affinion Holdings (the Existing Common Stock\u201d), issued pursuant to that certain Warrant Agreement, dated as of May 10, 2017, by and between Affinion Holdings and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, as transfer agent (the 2017 Warrant Agreement\u201d), consented to an amendment to the 2017 Warrant Agreement as a result of which the 2017 Warrants, if unexercised, were mandatorily cashlessly exercised immediately following the consummation of the 2019 Exchange Offer but immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger (as defined below). Certain Consenting Stakeholders exercised their warrants using full physical settlement, subject to, and effective immediately following, the consummation of the 2019 Exchange Offer but immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger. In addition, Metro SPV exercised for cash its Limited Warrant effective immediately following the consummation of the 2019 Exchange Offer but immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger.\nImmediately following the consummation of the 2019 Exchange Offer and the exercises of the 2017 Warrants and the Limited Warrant, AGHI Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and direct wholly owned subsidiary of Affinion Holdings ( Merger Sub\u201d), merged with and into Affinion Holdings with Affinion Holdings as the surviving entity (the Merger\u201d). The Merger was approved by the board of directors and stockholders of each of Affinion Holdings and Merger Sub. As a result of the Merger, (i) each holder of Class C Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Affinion Holdings or Class D Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Affinion Holdings (the Class C/D Common Stock\u201d) received for each share of Class C/D Common Stock cash equal to $0.01 per share of Class C/D Common Stock held thereby, (ii) each holder of Existing Common Stock, including as a result of the exercise of 2017 Warrants and the Limited Warrant as described above, received for each share of Existing Common Stock 0.089809 New Investor Warrants to be issued by Affinion Holdings (the New Investor Warrants\u201d) and (iii) each holder of Class M Common Stock received for each share of Class M Common Stock one share of New Common Stock of the surviving entity. In connection with the issuance of the Class M Common Stock, the Company and its stockholders approved amendments to Affinion Holdings' Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to create a new class of common stock, designated as Class M Common Stock,\u201d having par value $0.01 per share (the Charter Amendment\u201d) and Fourth Amended and Restated By-laws (the By-laws\u201d) to make them consistent with provisions of the Charter Amendment (the By-laws Amendment\u201d).\nPursuant to the Investor Warrant Agreement, dated as of April 10, 2019, by and between Affinion Holdings and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, as warrant agent (the New Investor Warrant Agreement\u201d), each New Investor Warrant is exercisable for one share of New Common Stock at any time, subject to required regulatory approval and filings applicable to the holder of a New Investor Warrant. In order to exercise its New Investor Warrant, a holder of New Investor Warrants will need to submit an exercise notice to Affinion Holdings, together with the exercise price equal of $67.12 per share. The New Investor Warrants will be immediately exercisable upon issuance at the option of the holders thereof, and will be mandatorily redeemable by Affinion Holdings on the fifth year anniversary of the initial issuance thereof, for $0.01 per share. New Investor Warrants will not be exercisable if the recipient of the New Common Stock to be issued upon exercise has failed to obtain any required consents or waivers from, or failed to file any required notices with, any applicable governmental agency, including the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority. The New Investor Warrants will not be entitled to participate in dividends on New Common Stock but instead will benefit from customary anti-dilution protections that result in an adjustment of the conversion price when and if dividends, distributions or stock buy-backs are effected. In addition to the anti-dilution adjustments to exercise price in the event of dividends and distributions declared and paid on New Common Stock, the New Investor Warrant has limited and customary anti-dilution adjustments for stock dividends, splits, reverse-splits, reclassifications, reorganizations and similar transformative transactions that alter, amend or modify the New Common Stock.\nUpon exercise of New Investor Warrants, such holders will be required to execute joinders to the New Stockholders Agreement (as defined below).\nThe consummation of the 2019 Recapitalization resulted in an ownership change\u201d for the Company pursuant to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. This substantially limits our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards (including those attributable to the 2005 Acquisition) and certain other pre-change tax attributes.\nThe Company is evaluating the accounting for the 2019 Recapitalization, including the treatment of debt issuance costs, for which there will be significant charges that impact future periods.\nResults of Operations\nSupplemental Data\nWe manage our business using a portfolio approach, meaning that we allocate our investments in the ongoing pursuit of the highest and best available returns, allocating our resources to whichever products, services, geographies and programs offer the best opportunities.

Gross Transactional Sales Volume per Transaction is calculated by taking the Gross Transactional Sales Volume reported for the period and dividing it by the total transactions for the same period. \n (2) Average Subscribers and Average Legacy Members for the period are all calculated by determining the average subscribers or members, as applicable, for each month in the period (adding the number of subscribers or members, as applicable, at the beginning of the month with the number of subscribers or members, as applicable, at the end of the month and dividing that total by two) and then averaging that result for the period. A subscriber's or member's, as applicable, account is added or removed in the period in which the subscriber or member, as applicable, has joined or cancelled. \n (3) Annualized Net Revenue per Average Subscriber and Legacy Member are all calculated by taking the revenues from subscribers or members, as applicable, for the period and dividing it by the average subscribers or members, as applicable, for the period. Quarterly periods are then multiplied by four to annualize this amount for comparative purposes. Upon cancellation of a subscriber or member, as applicable, the subscriber's or member's, as applicable, revenues are no longer recognized in the calculation. \nSegment and Adjusted EBITDA\nSegment EBITDA consists of income from operations before depreciation and amortization. Segment EBITDA is the measure management uses to evaluate segment performance and we present Segment EBITDA to enhance your understanding of our operating performance. We use Segment EBITDA as one criterion for evaluating our performance relative to that of our peers. We believe that Segment EBITDA is an operating performance measure, and not a liquidity measure, that provides investors and analysts with a measure of operating results unaffected by differences in capital structures, capital investment cycles and ages of related assets among otherwise comparable companies. However, Segment EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under U.S. GAAP (as defined in Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein), and Segment EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. You should not consider Segment EBITDA as an alternative to operating or net income determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of cash flows, or as a measure of liquidity.\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA for each segment provides supplemental information useful to investors as it is frequently used by the financial community to analyze performance period to period, to analyze a company's ability to service its debt and to facilitate comparisons among companies. We believe Adjusted EBITDA also provides additional supplemental information to compare results among our segments. However, Adjusted EBITDA by segment is not a measurement of financial performance under U.S. GAAP, and Adjusted EBITDA by segment may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. You should not consider Adjusted EBITDA by segment as an alternative to operating or net income determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of cash flows, or as a measure of liquidity.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended

Operating Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nThe following is a summary of changes affecting our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nNet revenues decreased $24.3 million, or 3.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the same period of the prior year primarily from lower retail revenues from a decline in retail member volumes in Legacy Membership and Package. Increased growth with existing clients and launches with new clients in Global Loyalty was partially offset by the impact of the loss of a top 5 loyalty partner in the fourth quarter.\nSegment EBITDA decreased $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the same period of the prior year as the impact of lower net revenues and higher general and administrative expense was partially offset by lower marketing and commissions expense and lower operating costs.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nThe following section provides an overview of our consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nNet Revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we reported net revenues of $699.8 million, a decrease of $24.3 million, or 3.4%, as compared to net revenues of $724.1 million in the same period of the prior year. Global Loyalty net revenues increased $14.2 million primarily due to increased growth with existing clients and launches with new clients, partially offset by the impact of the loss of a top 5 loyalty partner in the fourth quarter. Net revenues increased $1.8 million in Global Customer Engagement primarily from the favorable impact of foreign exchange. Net revenues in Legacy Membership and Package decreased $40.3 million primarily due to the expected attrition of legacy members, including those from our large financial institution partners, principally due to the cessation of new marketing campaigns and terminated programs with those partners as a result of the regulatory issues that have negatively impacted these partners. We expect this downward trend in net revenues related to our financial institution partners to continue for the foreseeable future. Net revenues further decreased from lower package revenue primarily the result of lower average package members.\nMarketing and Commissions Expense. Marketing and commissions expense decreased $30.7 million, or 17.7%, to $142.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $173.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Marketing and commissions expense in Legacy Membership and Package decreased $16.9 million primarily due to lower commissions principally due to the decline in the member base. Marketing and commissions expense in Global Customer Engagement decreased $10.5 million primarily due to lower employee-related costs.\nOperating Costs. Operating costs decreased $21.0 million, or 6.0%, to $331.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $352.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Operating costs in Legacy Membership and Package decreased $12.2 million primarily from lower product and servicing costs associated with the lower retail member volumes. Operating costs in Global Loyalty decreased $9.6 million primarily from a charge of $23.2 million recorded in relation to the cyber theft that occurred in the first quarter of 2017, partially offset by higher servicing costs related to the higher net revenues and additional investments, including the opening of a new call center.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense increased $27.9 million, or 32.5% to $113.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $85.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Corporate costs increased $24.4 million primarily due to higher employee-related costs, principally severance.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $48.2 million from $45.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily from an increase in amortization expense of $1.7 million principally the result of intangible assets acquired in 2018 as well as from an increase in depreciation expense of $1.2 million principally the result of an increase in capitalized software put into service.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased $54.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of restructuring our debt on May 10, 2017, whereby we entered into the Existing Credit Agreement for term loans totaling $1.34 billion and revolving loans. The proceeds were used to refinance our existing senior secured credit facility and redeem in full our outstanding International Notes. We also completed a private offer to exchange or repurchase Affinion's 2010 senior notes, Affinion Holdings' 2013 senior notes and the Investments senior subordinated notes for the 2017 Notes and 2017 Warrants to acquire Existing Common Stock. The new debt issues are at higher principal amounts with associated higher interest rates.\nGain (Loss) on Extinguishment of Debt. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a loss in the amount of $32.0 million as a result of the prepayment of long-term debt immediately following the closing of the ABG Sale.\nIncome Tax Benefit. Income tax benefit decreased $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to the estimated decrease in the state and foreign deferred tax provisions, partially offset by an increase in the current state and foreign tax provisions and an increase in the federal deferred tax provision for the same period.\nThe Company's effective income tax rates for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were 15.8% and 37.2%, respectively. The difference in the effective tax rates for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is primarily a result of the change in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the TCJA\u201d), coupled with the increase in the loss before income taxes and non-controlling interest from $73.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $171.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, and a decrease in the income tax benefit from $27.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $27.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Company's tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amount of income it earns in those jurisdictions. It is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year, but are not consistent from year to year. The requirement to maintain valuation allowances also had an impact on the difference in the Company's effective tax rates.\nIncome (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, net of tax. Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax increased $426.3 million to $447.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $21.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to a gain on sale, net of tax of $443.0 million recorded upon completion of the sale of the domestic insurance business, partially offset by a decrease in income from discontinued operations, net of tax of $16.7 million due to the timing of the closing of the sale of the domestic insurance business.\nOperating Segment Results\nNet revenues, Segment EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA by

Net revenues from Global Loyalty increased $14.2 million, or 6.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $239.3 million as compared to $225.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to increased growth with existing clients and launches with new clients, partially offset by the impact of the loss of a top 5 loyalty partner in the fourth quarter.\nSegment EBITDA increased $23.2 million, or 36.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of a charge of $23.2 million recorded in relation to the cyber theft that occurred in the first quarter of 2017. The impact of higher net revenues principally driven by growth with existing clients and launches with new clients was offset by the impact of the loss of a top 5 loyalty partner in the fourth quarter as well as by higher servicing costs.\nGlobal Customer Engagement. Global Customer Engagement net revenues increased $1.8 million, or 0.5%, to $361.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $359.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Net revenues increased $5.0 million from the favorable impact of foreign exchange. On a currency consistent basis, net revenues decreased $3.2 million.\nSegment EBITDA increased $6.3 million, or 11.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of an increase in net revenues of $1.8 million and a decrease in operating expenses of $4.3 million, principally due to lower employee-related costs.\nLegacy Membership and Package. Legacy Membership and Package net revenues decreased $40.3 million, or 28.8%, to $99.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $139.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Net revenues decreased primarily from the expected attrition of legacy members, including those from our large financial institution partners, principally due to the cessation of new marketing campaigns and terminated programs with those partners as a result of the regulatory issues that have negatively impacted such partners. We expect this downward trend in net revenues related to our financial institution partners to continue for the foreseeable future. Net revenues further decreased from lower package revenue primarily the result of lower average package members.\nSegment EBITDA decreased $5.2 million, or 13.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Segment EBITDA decreased as the impact from the lower net revenues of $40.3 million was partially offset by lower marketing and commissions expense of $16.9 million, lower operating costs of $12.2 million and lower general and administrative expense of $6.2 million. The decrease in marketing and commissions expense was primarily due to lower commissions principally due to the decline in the member base. The decrease in operating costs was the result of lower product and servicing costs related to the decrease in net revenues. The decrease in general and administrative expense was primarily due to cost saving initiatives and lower fees related to certain legal matters.\nCorporate. Corporate costs include certain departmental service costs such as human resources, legal, corporate finance and accounting functions and unallocated portions of information technology. Expenses such as professional fees related to debt financing activities and stock compensation costs are also recorded in corporate. Corporate costs increased $28.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to higher employee-related costs, principally severance.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and

changes affecting our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nNet revenues decreased $17.9 million, or 2.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period of the prior year primarily the result of lower retail revenues from a decline in retail member volumes in Legacy Membership and Package, lower revenue in Global Loyalty primarily from the loss of a key client in 2015, and lower revenue in Global Customer Engagement primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, as well as the timing of marketing campaign launches and product launches with new clients.\nSegment EBITDA decreased $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period of the prior year as the impact of lower net revenues and higher operating costs was partially offset by lower marketing and commissions expense and general and administrative expense.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nThe following section provides an overview of our consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNet Revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2017 we reported net revenues of $724.1 million, a decrease of $17.9 million, or 2.4%, as compared to net revenues of $742.0 million in the comparable period of 2016. Global Loyalty net revenues increased $58.1 million primarily due to increased growth with existing clients and launches with new clients. Net revenues decreased $27.0 million in Global Customer Engagement primarily from lower net revenues in our engagement solutions business, which was principally due to the timing of product launches with new clients, lower revenue in our revenue enhancement business and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $4.2 million. Net revenues in Legacy Membership and Package decreased $50.0 million primarily due to the expected attrition of legacy members, including those from our large financial institution partners, principally due to the cessation of new marketing campaigns and terminated programs with those partners as a result of the regulatory issues that have negatively impacted these partners. We expect this downward trend in net revenues related to our financial institution partners to continue for the foreseeable future. Net revenues further decreased from lower package revenue primarily the result of lower average package members.\nMarketing and Commissions Expense. Marketing and commissions expense decreased $27.3 million, or 13.6%, to $173.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $200.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Marketing and commissions expense in Global Customer Engagement decreased $12.5 million primarily due to lower volumes partially offset by higher commissions resulting from a migration of certain partner commission arrangements from traditional bounty to advance commissions whereby the partner has the potential for additional revenue sharing. Marketing and commissions expense in Legacy Membership and Package decreased $17.2 million primarily due to lower commissions principally due to the decline in the member base.\nOperating Costs. Operating costs increased $33.9 million, or 10.6%, to $352.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $318.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Operating costs in Global Loyalty increased $49.5 million primarily from higher servicing costs related to the higher net revenues, including the opening of a new call center in the fourth quarter, and a charge of $23.2 million recorded in relation to the cyber theft that occurred in the first quarter of 2017. The charge includes costs associated with customer remediation of the cyber theft and costs related to a commercial dispute with a gift card provider. An insurance claim related to the cyber theft is currently being pursued with our carriers and we expect a recovery in a future period which will be recorded when realizable. Operating costs in Legacy Membership and Package decreased $12.8 million primarily from lower product and servicing costs associated with the lower retail member volumes.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense decreased $23.3 million, or 21.4% to $85.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $109.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. General and administrative expense in Legacy Membership and Package decreased $18.5 million primarily due to lower reserves and fees related to certain legal matters. Corporate costs decreased $8.6 million primarily due to cost savings initiatives, lower employee incentive plan costs and the favorable impact of unrealized foreign exchange on intercompany borrowings. General and administrative expense in Global Customer Engagement increased $5.8 million primarily due to higher professional fees and provisions recorded related to the collectability of certain customer receivables.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $10.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $45.3 million from $55.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily from a decrease in depreciation expense of $5.3 million principally the result of fully depreciating significant capital projects in 2017. In addition, amortization expense decreased by $4.7 million related to lower amortization of intangible assets acquired in various acquisitions, principally member relationships, which are amortized on an accelerated basis.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased $68.0 million, or 90.9% to $142.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $74.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as a result of restructuring our debt on May 10, 2017, whereby we entered into the Existing Credit Agreement for term loans totaling $1.34 billion and revolving loans. The proceeds were used to refinance our existing senior secured credit facility and redeem in full our outstanding International Notes. We also completed a private offer to exchange or repurchase Affinion's 2010 senior notes, Affinion Holdings' 2013 senior notes and the Investments senior subordinated notes for the 2017 Notes and 2017 Warrants to acquire Existing Common Stock. The new debt issues are at higher principal amounts with associated higher interest rates.\nGain on Extinguishment of Debt. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a gain in the amount of $3.5 million as a result of restructuring our debt on May 10, 2017 and July 17, 2017.\nIncome Tax Benefit (Provision). Income tax expense decreased $30.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the SAB 118 estimated decrease in the federal and state deferred tax provisions related to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and a decrease in the current foreign and federal tax provisions, partially offset by an increase in the current federal and state tax provisions and the foreign deferred tax provision for the same period.\nThe Company's effective income tax rates for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were 37.2% and (19.8)%, respectively. The difference in the effective tax rates for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is primarily a result of the increase in the loss from continuing operations before income taxes to $73.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $16.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and the change in the income tax provision from $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to an income tax benefit of $27.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflects the estimated impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of $25.5 million which includes the impact on deferred taxes of the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate to 21% and the impact on our valuation allowance assessment. The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2017 also includes the impact on the state tax provision for those states with current conformity to the Internal Revenue Code. The Company's tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amount of income it earns in those jurisdictions. It is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year, but are not consistent from year to year. In addition to the state and foreign income taxes, the requirement to maintain valuation allowances had the most significant impact on the difference between the Company's effective tax rate and the former statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of 35%.\nIncome (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, net of tax. Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax decreased $15.1 million to $21.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $36.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to increased interest expense, principally driven by higher interest rates as a result of restructuring our debt on May 10, 2017 and due to an increased income tax provision, principally due to an increase in taxable income as a result of intra-period allocation requirements under U.S. GAAP.\nOperating Segment Results\nNet revenues, Segment EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA by operating

GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below and Note 19-Segment Information in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein for a discussion on Segment EBITDA. \nGlobal Loyalty. Net revenues from Global Loyalty increased $58.1 million, or 34.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $225.1 million as compared to $167.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to increased growth with existing clients and launches with new clients.\nSegment EBITDA increased $7.6 million, or 13.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, as the impact of the higher net revenue was partially offset by higher servicing costs, including the opening of a new call center in the fourth quarter, and a charge of $23.2 million recorded in relation to the cyber theft that occurred in the first quarter of 2017. The charge includes costs associated with customer remediation of the cyber theft and costs related to a commercial dispute with a gift card provider. An insurance claim related to the cyber theft is currently being pursued with our carriers and we expect a recovery in a future period which will be recorded when realizable.\nGlobal Customer Engagement. Global Customer Engagement net revenues decreased $27.0 million, or 7.0%, to $359.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $386.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net revenues decreased $4.2 million from the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. On a currency consistent basis, net revenues decreased $22.8 million primarily from lower net revenues in our engagement solutions business principally due to the timing of product launches with new clients, as well as lower revenue in our revenue enhancement business.\nSegment EBITDA decreased $15.4 million, or 21.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 as the lower net revenues of $27.0 million and higher general and administrative expense of $5.8 million were partially offset by lower marketing and commissions expense of $12.5 million and lower operating costs of $4.9 million. The lower marketing and commissions expense was primarily attributable to lower volumes partially offset by higher commissions resulting from a migration of certain partner commission arrangements from traditional bounty to advance commissions whereby the partner has the potential for additional revenue sharing. The lower operating costs were primarily related to lower product costs and the favorable impact of foreign exchange. The higher general and administrative expense was primarily due to higher professional fees and provisions recorded related to the collectability of certain customer receivables.\nLegacy Membership and Package. Legacy Membership and Package net revenues decreased $50.1 million, or 26.4%, to $139.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $189.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net revenues decreased primarily from the expected attrition of legacy members, including those from our large financial institution partners, principally due to the cessation of new marketing campaigns and terminated programs with those partners as a result of the regulatory issues that have negatively impacted such partners. We expect this downward trend in net revenues related to our financial institution partners to continue for the foreseeable future. Net revenues further decreased from lower package revenue primarily the result of lower average package members.\nSegment EBITDA decreased $1.2 million, or 2.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Segment EBITDA decreased as the impact from the lower net revenues of $50.1 million was partially offset by lower marketing and commissions expense of $17.2 million, lower operating costs of $12.8 million and lower general and administrative expense of $18.5 million. The lower marketing and commissions expense was primarily due to lower commissions principally due to the decline in the member base. The lower operating costs are the result of lower product and servicing costs related to the lower revenue. The lower general and administrative expense was primarily due to lower reserves and fees related to certain legal matters.\nCorporate. Corporate costs include certain departmental service costs such as human resources, legal, corporate finance and accounting functions and unallocated portions of information technology. Expenses such as professional fees related to debt financing activities and stock compensation costs are also recorded in corporate. Corporate costs decreased $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily the result of cost savings initiatives, lower employee incentive plan costs and the favorable impact of unrealized foreign exchange on intercompany borrowings.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nFinancial Condition - December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017\nTable 114: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 682.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 766.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (84.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,939.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,324.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (385.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total deficit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,257.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,557.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 300.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal assets decreased $84.9 million, primarily due to decreases in current assets held for sale and non-current assets held for sale of $46.0 million and $83.3 million, respectively, from the completion of the ABG Sale, partially offset by an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $45.2 million principally due to the retention of a portion of sale proceeds from the ABG Sale.\nTotal liabilities decreased $385.1 million, primarily due to the repayment of $466.7 million of long-term debt immediately following the closing of the ABG Sale and decreases in current liabilities held for sale and non-current liabilities held for sale of $49.1 million and $7.6 million, respectively, from the completion of the ABG Sale, partially offset by payment-in-kind interest of $86.2 million and additional borrowings of $45.0 million under the Company's revolving credit facility.\nTotal deficit decreased $300.2 million, primarily due to net income of $302.1 million, the retained deficit impact of a change in accounting policy of $1.6 million and share based compensation of $1.7 million, partially offset by the impact of currency translation adjustment of $5.4 million.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity on both a short-term and long-term basis are cash on hand and cash generated through operating and financing activities. Our primary cash needs are to service our indebtedness and for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. Many of the Company's significant costs are variable in nature, including marketing and commissions. The Company has a great degree of flexibility in the amount and timing of marketing expenditures and focuses its marketing expenditures on its most profitable marketing opportunities. Commissions correspond directly with revenue generated and have been decreasing as a percentage of revenue over the last several years.\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 205-40, Going Concern, management has the responsibility to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date that these consolidated financial statements are issued. In connection therewith, management evaluated relevant conditions and events known at the date these consolidated financial statements were issued, including the consummation of the 2019 Recapitalization (as defined below) which resulted in, among other effects (i) an approximately $39.3 million reduction in estimated cash interest costs for 2019, (ii) $27.3 million of additional liquidity upon closing, (iii) the elimination of principal amortization payments due on 2019 Term Loans (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) through December 31, 2021 and (iv) certain amendments to financial covenant requirements, as well as the impact of the loss of one of the Company's top five Global Loyalty clients during 2018 and our overall liquidity needs. After consideration of these relevant conditions and events, among others, Management concluded that the 2019 Recapitalization alleviated the substantial doubt regarding the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date that these consolidated financial statements were issued that had existed prior to the consummation of the 2019 Recapitalization.\nOn February 19, 2019, a cash interest payment of approximately $22.2 million was due under the Existing Credit Agreement. On February 26, 2019, Affinion entered into a forbearance agreement (the First Forbearance Agreement\u201d) with the requisite lenders under the Existing Credit Agreement in which such requisite lenders agreed to forbear from taking any action with respect to the failure of Affinion to pay interest on the loans as required under the Existing Credit Agreement on February 19, 2019, (the Interest Payment Date\u201d) that would otherwise constitute a default under the Existing Credit Agreement and constitute an event of default under Section 7.01(c) of the Existing Credit Agreement if not paid within five business days of the Interest Payment Date until the earlier of March 5, 2019 and the occurrence of a termination event under the First Forbearance Agreement.\nOn March 1, 2019, Affinion entered into a forbearance agreement (the Second Forbearance Agreement\u201d) in connection with the Support Agreement with the requisite lenders under the Existing Credit Agreement in which such requisite lenders agreed to forbear from taking any action with respect to the failure of Affinion to (i) pay interest on the loans as required under the Existing Credit Agreement on the Interest Payment Date that would otherwise constitute a default under the Existing Credit Agreement and constitute an event of default under Section 7.01(c) of the Existing Credit Agreement if not paid within five business days of the Interest Payment Date, (ii) deliver audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 that are not qualified in any material respect on or prior to the date that is 90 days after December 31, 2018 that would otherwise constitute a default and, if not remedied within 5 days after notice from the agent under the Existing Credit Agreement, would constitute an event of default and (iii) comply with the requirements of Section 5.13 of the Existing Credit Agreement that would otherwise constitute a default and, if not remedied within 30 days after notice from the agent under the Existing Credit Agreement, would constitute an event of default, in each case until June 3, 2019. On March 22, 2019, Affinion entered into an amendment to the Second Forbearance Agreement to add to the list of specified defaults and/or events of default under the Existing Credit Agreement with respect to which requisite lenders agree to forbear from taking any action until the earlier of June 3, 2019 and certain events of termination, the failure of Affinion to make any additional scheduled payments of interest and principal under the Existing Credit Agreement through June 3, 2019.\nAffinion Holdings is a holding company, with no direct operations and no significant assets other than the ownership of 100% of the stock of Affinion. Because we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries, our cash flows and our ability to service our indebtedness is dependent upon cash dividends and distributions or other transfers from our subsidiaries. Payments to us by our subsidiaries are contingent upon our subsidiaries' earnings, but are not limited by the Existing Credit Agreement and the 2017 Notes Indenture.\nAlthough we historically have had a working capital deficit, we anticipate that, after giving effect to the 2019 Recapitalization, in future periods the reduction in cash interest payments compared to those under our prior financing arrangements will favorably impact our operating cash flows and offset the working capital deficit that will continue for the foreseeable future.\nCash Flows - Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nAt December 31, 2018, we had $99.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash on hand, an increase of $34.5 million from $64.6 million at December 31, 2017. The following table summarizes our cash flows and compares changes in our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash on hand to the same period in the prior year.\nTable 115: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 479.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (38.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 518.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (463.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (493.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of exchange rate changes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 34.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated $15.4 million more cash from operating activities than during the year ended December 31, 2017. A net $29.6 million decrease in receivables, driven primarily by the loss of a key loyalty client in the fourth quarter of 2017 and a net $12.3 million increase in accounts payable, driven primarily by larger commissions payable in the insurance solutions business prior to the ABG Sale were partially offset by a net $15.4 million increase in other current assets, driven primarily by larger prepaid credit card charges from growth with new global loyalty clients and an $8.7 million increase in cash interest payments.\nInvesting Activities\nWe generated $479.5 million of cash from investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to a use of $38.5 million of cash during the year ended December 31, 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2018, proceeds from the ABG Sale, net of cash transferred was $517.3 million, which was partially offset by $32.1 million for capital expenditures and $5.7 million of acquisition-related payments, net of cash acquired. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we used $38.1 million for capital expenditures and made acquisition-related payments, net of cash acquired, of $0.4 million.\nFinancing Activities\nWe used $463.3 million of cash from financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $30.4 million of cash generated from financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we made term loan payments of $507.1 million, including $14.4 million in repayment premiums and we had net borrowings under our revolving credit facility of $45.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we made payments on our first-lien and second-lien term loans of $753.8 million and $425.0 million, respectively, redeemed the International senior subordinated notes for $118.5 million, redeemed Affinion's 2010 senior notes, Affinion Holdings' 2013 senior notes and the Investments 2013 senior subordinated notes for $227.4 million and made payments on our term loan under the Existing Credit Agreement of $10.0 million. We also issued 2017 Notes for $235.9 million, received $1,303.7 million and $55.0 million of term loans and revolving credit facility under the Existing Credit Agreement and incurred $29.3 million of financing costs related to the 2017 Notes and Existing Credit Agreement.\nCash Flows - Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nAt December 31, 2017, we had $64.6 million of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash on hand, an increase of $0.8 million from $63.8 million at December 31, 2016.

During the year ended December 31, 2016, we made payments on our first-lien term loan of $7.8 million.\nCredit Facilities and Long-Term Debt following the 2019 Recapitalization\nGeneral\nFollowing the 2019 Recapitalization, we will remain a highly leveraged company. As of December 31, 2018, after giving effect to the 2019 Recapitalization, we would have had approximately $1.1 billion in indebtedness on a consolidated basis, consisting of (1) $719.1 million outstanding term loans under Affinion's Amended Credit Agreement, as defined below, (2) $357.0 million principal outstanding under Affinion's New Notes and (3) $10.7 million principal amount outstanding under Affinion's 2017 Notes, as defined below and there would have been no amount outstanding under Affinion's revolving credit facility. In addition, Affinion would have had $80.0 million available under the revolving credit facility, after giving effect to the issuance of $5.0 million of letters of credit. See -Contractual Obligations and Commitments\u201d for a summary of our aggregate contractual obligations at December 31, 2018, giving effect to the 2019 Recapitalization, as if the Recapitalization had closed on December 31, 2018 and the estimated timing and effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods.\nAs of December 31, 2018, Affinion was in compliance with the restrictive covenants under Affinion's debt agreements.\nThe Amended Credit Agreement\nAffinion Holdings, Affinion, as the borrower, the lenders from time to time party thereto (the Lenders\u201d), certain subsidiaries of Affinion and HPS Investment Partners, LLC, as the administrative agent and collateral agent, are parties to that certain Credit Agreement, dated as of May 10, 2017 (as amended and/or amended and restated by that First Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated as of November 30, 2017, that Second Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated as of May 4, 2018, that Third Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated as of July 16, 2018 and that Fourth Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated as of November 14, 2018, the Existing Credit Agreement\u201d), pursuant to which the Lenders have made certain loans and provided certain commitments (subject to the terms and conditions thereof) to Affinion.\nIn connection with the consummation of the 2019 Recapitalization on April 10, 2019 (the Closing Date\u201d), Affinion entered into certain amendments to the Existing Credit Agreement (as amended, the Amended Credit Agreement\u201d) to (i) obtain an extension of the maturity of the Revolving Facility Commitments (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) and Term Loans (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) existing immediately prior to the consummation of the 2019 Recapitalization and (ii) modify certain other provisions in the Existing Credit Agreement. The Revolving Facility Lenders (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) and the Consenting Lenders agreed to extend the maturity of all Revolving Facility Loans (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) and such Consenting Lender's outstanding Term Loans (so extended, the 2019 Term Loans\u201d), as applicable, and consent to the proposed modifications with respect thereto in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Fifth Amendment to the Existing Credit Agreement (the Fifth Amendment\u201d); upon the consummation of the 2019 Recapitalization, Term Loans held by Term Lenders (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) that did not agree to extend their Term Loans into 2019 Term Loans were deemed a separate tranche from the 2019 Term Loans (such Term Loans to be referred to as the Non-Extended Term Loans\u201d), and the Revolving Facility Commitments were reduced to $85.0 million.\nThe material terms of the Amended Credit Agreement are the following:\nThe Amended Credit Agreement provides for quarterly amortization payments of the 2019 Term Loans totaling (i) for the first 3 years following the Fifth Amendment Effective Date, 0% per annum, (ii) for the fourth year following the Fifth Amendment Effective Date, 1.0% per annum and (iii) for each year thereafter 2.5% per annum, in each case, payable quarterly, with the balance payable upon the final maturity date. The 2019 Term Loans mature on April 10, 2024. The Revolving Facility Commitments under the Amended Credit Agreement mature on April 10, 2023. The Non-Extended Term Loans continue to be subject to an amortization schedule consistent with that set forth in the Existing Credit Agreement.\nIn addition, the Amended Credit Agreement requires Affinion to prepay outstanding term loans with:\n \u2022 100% of the net cash proceeds of asset sales and dispositions in excess of an amount per transaction and in the aggregate per fiscal year, subject, to the ability to reinvest a portion of such net cash proceeds; \n \u2022 100% of the net cash proceeds from any insurance or condemnation event, subject to the ability to reinvest a portion of such net cash proceeds; \n \u2022 100% of the net cash proceeds from extraordinary and non-recurring cash receipts in excess of an amount per receipt; \n \u2022 50% of Affinion's excess cash flow beginning with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019; and \n \u2022 100% of the net cash proceeds received from issuances of debt, subject to certain exclusions including certain debt permitted to be incurred under the Amended Credit Agreement. \nThe terms of the Amended Credit Agreement allows Affinion to permanently reduce the revolving loan commitments at any time without premium or penalty, subject to the payment of customary LIBOR breakage costs, if any, and provided that the commitments may not be reduced below the aggregate outstanding amount of revolving loans and letters of credit. In addition, Affinion will be able to terminate the Amended Credit Agreement upon prior written notice, and, in some cases, be able to revoke such notice. Upon termination, Affinion will be required to repay all obligations outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement and to satisfy all outstanding letter of credit obligations. Voluntary prepayments of 2019 Term Loans will be subject to (i) a make-whole premium for prepayments on or prior to the second anniversary of the Closing Date, and (ii) a prepayment premium of 103% of the principal amount prepaid after the second anniversary but on or prior to the third anniversary of the Closing Date. Voluntary prepayments of the Non-Extended Term Loans will continue to be subject to the premiums set forth in the Existing Credit Agreement.\nThe interest rates are based on, at Affinion's option, with respect to (A) 2019 Term Loans, (x) the higher of (i) adjusted LIBOR and (ii) 1.00%, in each case plus 5.75% (of which, from the Closing Date through the third anniversary thereof, 1.75% may be paid in kind, thereafter through the fourth anniversary thereof, 1.25% may be paid in kind, and thereafter, 0.75% may be paid in kind), or (y) the highest of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.5% and (iii) 2.00% ( ABR\u201d), in each case plus 4.75% (of which, from the Closing Date through the third anniversary thereof, 1.75% may be paid in kind, thereafter through the fourth anniversary thereof, 1.25% may be paid in kind, and thereafter, 0.75% may be paid in kind), and (B) revolving loans under the Amended Credit Agreement (x) the higher of (i) adjusted LIBOR and (ii) 1.00%, in each case plus 4.00%, or (y) the highest of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.5% and (iii) 2.00%, in each case plus 3.00%. The interest rates for the Non-Extended Term Loans will continue to be the same as those set forth in the Existing Credit Agreement.\nAdditionally, if any amount payable under the Amended Credit Agreement is not paid when due, (i) all overdue amounts owing under the Amended Credit Agreement will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the rate otherwise applicable thereto plus an additional 2.0% or at the ABR plus the applicable margin plus an additional 2.0% if no rate is otherwise applicable thereto and (ii) all other principal amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the rate otherwise applicable thereto plus an additional 2.0%.\nAffinion has the option of requesting that loans be made as LIBOR loans, converting any part of outstanding ABR loans (other than swingline loans) to LIBOR loans and converting any outstanding LIBOR loan to an ABR loan, subject to the payment of LIBOR breakage costs. With respect to LIBOR loans, interest will be payable in arrears at the end of each applicable interest period, but in any event at least every three (3) months. With respect to ABR loans, interest will be payable on the last business day of each fiscal quarter. In each case, calculations of interest are based on a 360-day year (or 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, in the case of loans based on the administrative agent's prime ABR rate, and loans in any jurisdiction where the relevant interbank market practice is to use a 365 or 366 day year) and actual days elapsed.\nAffinion's obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement continue to be guaranteed by Affinion Holdings and by each of Affinion's existing and subsequently acquired or organized domestic subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions, and certain existing and subsequently acquired foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions.\nThe Amended Credit Agreement continues to be secured to the extent legally permissible by substantially all the assets of (i) Affinion Holdings, which continue to consist of a perfected first-priority pledge of all of Affinion's capital stock and (ii) Affinion and the subsidiary guarantors, including but not limited to: (a) a first-priority pledge of substantially all capital stock held by Affinion or any subsidiary guarantor (which pledge, with respect to stock of certain foreign subsidiaries, may be limited to 100% of the non-voting stock (if any) of such foreign subsidiaries and 65% of the voting stock of such foreign subsidiaries) and (b) perfected first-priority security interests in substantially all tangible and intangible assets of Affinion and each subsidiary guarantor, subject to certain exceptions.\nThe Amended Credit Agreement contains financial, affirmative and negative covenants that we believe are usual and customary for a senior secured credit agreement. The negative covenants in the Amended Credit Agreement include, among other things, limitations (all of which are subject to certain exceptions) on Affinion's and its restricted subsidiaries' (and in certain cases, Affinion Holdings') ability to:\n \u2022 declare dividends and make other distributions; \n \u2022 redeem or repurchase Affinion's or such restricted subsidiary's capital stock; \n \u2022 prepay, redeem or repurchase certain of Affinion's or such restricted subsidiary's junior indebtedness; \n \u2022 make loans or investments (including acquisitions); \n \u2022 incur additional indebtedness; \n \u2022 grant liens; \n \u2022 enter into sale-leaseback transactions; \n \u2022 modify the terms of subordinated debt (and certain senior unsecured debt); \n \u2022 enter into agreements that would restrict the ability of Affinion's subsidiaries to pay dividends; \n \u2022 change Affinion's or such restricted subsidiary's business or the business of its subsidiaries; \n \u2022 merge or enter into acquisitions; \n \u2022 sell Affinion's or such restricted subsidiary's assets; and \n \u2022 enter into transactions with Affinion's affiliates. \nIn addition, the Amended Credit Agreement requires Affinion to comply with a maximum Senior Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) beginning with the fiscal quarter ending on September 30, 2020.\nThe events of default under the Amended Credit Agreement include, among others, nonpayment, material misrepresentations, breach of covenants, insolvency, bankruptcy, certain judgments, change of control (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) and cross-events of defaults and acceleration on material indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of default and the acceleration of the outstanding term loans under the Amended Credit Agreement (including, without limitation, by way of automatic acceleration), the applicable prepayment premium that would have been due if the term loans were optionally prepaid at such time shall also become due and payable.\nThe New Notes\nOn April 10, 2019, Affinion issued $357.0 million aggregate principal amount of New Notes under a new indenture (the New Notes Indenture\u201d) by and among Affinion, the guarantors party thereto and GLAS Trust Company LLC, as trustee.\nThe New Notes are unsecured senior obligations of Affinion, as issuer, and each of Affinion Holdings' and Affinion's restricted subsidiaries that guarantee the Amended Credit Agreement (collectively, the Guarantors\u201d), as guarantors; provided that the obligations of any Guarantor that is organized in any jurisdiction other than the United States or the United Kingdom with respect to its guarantee is subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full in cash of all obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement (as amended, restated, amended and restated, supplemented, refinanced, replaced or otherwise modified). The New Notes will mature on October 10, 2024, at their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the maturity date.\nInterest on the New Notes accrues at a rate per annum of 18.00%. Interest on the New Notes will be payable semi-annually in arrears on April 10 and October 10, commencing on October 10, 2019. Affinion will make each interest payment to the holders of record of the New Notes on the March 26 or September 25 record date immediately preceding the related interest payment date. The New Notes will accrue interest from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from and including October 10, 2024, and will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. Interest will be payable on the New Notes by increasing the principal amount of each holder's New Notes in the register by an amount equal to the amount of interest for the applicable interest period (rounded up to the nearest whole dollar) for such holder's New Notes (the PIK Payment\u201d). Following an increase in the principal amount of New Notes as a result of a PIK Payment, such New Notes will bear interest on such increased principal amount from and after the interest payment date in respect of which such PIK Payment was made.\nAffinion may redeem the New Notes, at its option, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days' prior notice sent electronically or mailed by first-class mail to each holder's registered address, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the New Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, to the redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).\nSubject to the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement, at any time, upon a Change of Control (as defined in the New Indenture), holders have the right to require Affinion to make an offer to purchase the holders' New Notes, in each case at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the New Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, to the redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).\nThe New Indenture contains certain covenants that limit Affinion's ability and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries to, among other things, (i) incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, or issue disqualified stock or preferred stock; (ii) pay dividends or make distributions; (iii) repurchase or redeem capital stock of Affinion or any parent of Affinion or subordinated indebtedness of Affinion or any restricted subsidiary of Affinion; (iv) make investments or acquisitions; (v) incur restrictions on the ability of certain of Affinion's subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments to Affinion; (vi) enter into transactions with affiliates; (vii) create liens; (viii) merge or consolidate with other companies or transfer all or substantially all of Affinion's assets; and (ix) prepay, redeem or repurchase debt that is junior in right of payment to the New Notes. In addition, the covenants restrict Affinion Holdings' ability to engage in certain businesses or business activities. Affinion is also required to deliver financial statements of Affinion and its restricted subsidiaries.\nThe New Indenture also provides that if the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio of Affinion on the maturity date of the New Notes is greater than or equal to 8.50 to 1.00, then, in lieu of Affinion making any required principal payment on the New Notes on such maturity date, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the New Notes outstanding may, with the consent of the Company elect to convert the then outstanding principal amount of the New Notes into New Common Stock, equal to a percentage of the fully diluted equity of the Company (calculated prior to dilution from the issuance of any New Common Stock, or securities convertible into New Common Stock, in each case issued under the New MIP), calculated by multiplying (A) 99.9999 by (B) (1) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of New Notes and any additional New Notes issued under the indenture (calculated after giving effect to any PIK Payments) as of such date divided by (2) the aggregate principal amount of New Notes and any additional New Notes issued under the indenture (including 18% PIK interest paid semi-annually on such New Notes and additional New Notes from the date of issuance thereof to the maturity date).\nAs of December 31, 2018, after giving effect to the 2019 Recapitalization, the New Notes would have ranked effectively junior to approximately $719.1 million of Affinion's secured indebtedness, all of which would have consisted of borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA consists of income from operations before depreciation and amortization further adjusted to exclude non-cash and unusual items and other adjustments permitted in Affinion's debt agreements to test the permissibility of certain types of transactions, including debt incurrence. We use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our operating performance and as a basis for determining payment of bonuses under our annual incentive plan. We present Adjusted EBITDA to enhance your understanding of our operating performance. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is an operating performance measure, and not a liquidity measure, that provides investors and analysts with a measure of operating results unaffected by differences in capital structures, capital investment cycles and ages of related assets among otherwise comparable companies. However, Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under U.S. GAAP and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. You should not consider Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative to operating or net income determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of cash flows, or as a measure of liquidity.\nSet forth below is a reconciliation of our consolidated net income attributable to Affinion Holdings for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 to Adjusted EBITDA.\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Twelve\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Months Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income attributable to Affinion Group Holdings, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 302.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: income from discontinued operations, net of tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: gain on sale of business, net of tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (443.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from continuing operations attributable to Affinion Group Holdings, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (145.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 197.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax benefit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (27.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income attributable to non-controlling interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Business optimization expenses and restructuring charges or expenses (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Extraordinary or nonrecurring or unusual losses, expenses or charges (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other, net (c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA, excluding pro forma adjustments (d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 147.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of pro forma adjustments (e)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA, including pro forma adjustments (f)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 157.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Represents the elimination of the effect of business optimization expenses and restructuring charges or expenses. \n (b) Represents the elimination of extraordinary or nonrecurring or unusual losses, expenses or charges. \n (c) Primarily represents the elimination of (i) net changes in certain reserves, (ii) share-based compensation expense and (iii) foreign currency gains and losses related to unusual, non-recurring intercompany transactions. \n (d) Adjusted EBITDA, excluding pro forma adjustments, does not give pro forma effect to the projected annualized benefits of restructurings and other cost savings initiatives.

See Note 14-Commitments and Contingencies in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein for a discussion of these contingent obligations. The above tables also do not include obligations in connection with our liabilities for uncertain tax positions as we have significant federal and state net operating loss carryforwards that we believe will be available to offset any liabilities for uncertain tax positions incurred. In addition, we refer you to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nDebt Repurchases\nWe or our affiliates have, in the past, and may, from time to time in the future, purchase any of our or Affinion's indebtedness. Any such future purchases may be made through open market or privately negotiated transactions with third parties or pursuant to one or more tender or exchange offers or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as we or any such affiliates may determine.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have not been disclosed in -Contractual Obligations and Commitments.\u201d\nCritical Accounting Policies\nIn presenting our audited consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported therein. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies related to revenue recognition, accounting for marketing costs, share-based compensation, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets and valuation of tax assets and liabilities could potentially affect our reported results and as such, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Several of the estimates and assumptions we are required to make relate to matters that are inherently uncertain, as they pertain to future events. However, certain events outside our control cannot be predicted and, as such, they cannot be contemplated in evaluating such estimates and assumptions. We believe that the estimates and assumptions used when preparing our audited consolidated financial statements were the most appropriate at the time. Significant estimates include accounting for income tax valuation allowances, litigation accruals, the fair values of reporting units, share-based compensation, assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations and financial instruments. For a summary of all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein.\nRevenue Recognition\nEffective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASC 606\u201d). The adoption of ASC 606 affected the Company's Global Loyalty, Global Customer Engagement and Legacy Membership and Package segments. Within the Global Loyalty segment, the Company has contracts with certain clients that have annual revenue-sharing and tiered pricing components (variable consideration arrangements) based on transaction volumes. Under prior guidance, revenue was recognized as the Company achieved those contractual tiers. Under ASC 606, revenue derived from these revenue-sharing and tiered pricing contracts is recognized based upon an estimate of the Company's ability to achieve those contractual tiers during each annual measurement period. Based on the Company's estimates of reaching different contractual tiers, a portion of the estimated annual revenue is deferred to a future period within the annual measurement period as these contract features provide a material right to the Company's clients. Within the Company's Global Customer Engagement segment, payments made by our customers for the provision of services were amortized over the length of the contract under prior guidance. Under ASC 606, the Company has reduced its amortization period to include only the non-cancellable period of the contract, though where the cancellation of a contract would be cost prohibitive to the customer, the Company may amortize its revenue beyond the non-cancellable period. Lastly, within the Legacy Membership and Package segment, certain members are entitled to a full membership refund throughout their entire membership term, regardless of when they cancel. Under ASC 606, revenue is recognized over time in a manner that reflects the timing of transfer of goods and services to these customers.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nIn connection with the Apollo Transactions, the Company recorded goodwill of approximately $315.3 million and intangible assets of $1,430.0 million. In subsequent years, the Company has consummated several acquisitions resulting in the recognition of additional goodwill, as well as intangible assets.\nUnder current accounting guidance, there is a requirement to assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. We assess goodwill for such impairment by comparing the carrying value of the reporting units to their fair values. Fair values of the reporting units are determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows and incorporate assumptions that we believe marketplace participants would utilize.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test for those reporting units that had goodwill recorded. Key assumptions used in the goodwill impairment test were a long-term growth rate of 2.0% growth and discount rates ranging from 10.0% to 11.0%. In 2018, the fair value of each reporting unit that has goodwill exceeded its respective carrying amount by more than 25%.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment and written down to fair value, as required by current accounting guidance. We perform reviews annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred. There were no impairments identified during each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. As of December 31, 2018, intangible assets consist of assets with finite useful lives initially recorded at their respective fair values.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are presented in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein using the asset and liability approach. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated based upon the temporary differences between the financial statements and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates. Deferred tax assets are recorded net of a valuation allowance when, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods. Decreases to the valuation allowance are recorded as reductions to the income tax provision, while increases to the valuation allowance result in additional income tax provision. The realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on estimated future taxable income. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company has recorded a full valuation allowance for its U.S. federal net deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company has also recorded valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets of certain state and foreign taxing jurisdictions.\nThe tax effects of an uncertain tax position ( UTP\u201d) taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns are recognized only if it is more likely-than-not\u201d to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on its technical merits as of the reporting date. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company recognizes changes in estimated accrued interest and penalties related to UTPs as an increase or decrease to the income tax provision, as applicable.\nThe Company recognizes the benefit of a UTP in the period when it is effectively settled. Previously recognized tax positions are derecognized in the first period in which it is no longer more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained upon examination.\nOn December 22, 2017, the TCJA was enacted into law. The TCJA significantly revises the U.S. corporate income tax laws by, among other things, lowering the corporate income tax rate to 21%, implementing a modified territorial tax system and imposing a one-time repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings and profits of U.S.-owned foreign subsidiaries (the transition tax\u201d). The U.S. federal income tax rate reduction was effective as of January 1, 2018. The Company has elected to account for GILTI (global intangible low-taxed income), as a period cost if and when incurred. The Company recorded provisional amounts related to the TCJA for the remeasurement of deferred taxes and the transition tax for the year ended December 31, 2017. During 2018 and prior to December 22, 2018, the Company finalized and completed its accounting associated with the TCJA, and no subsequent adjustments to provisional amounts were recorded.\nCautionary Statements for Forward-Looking Information\nThis Report contains forward-looking statements\u201d that involve risks and uncertainties.

The MD&A is organized as follows:\n \u2022 Overview. This section provides a general description of our business and operating segments, as well as recent developments that we believe are important in understanding our results of operations and financial condition and in anticipating future trends. \n \u2022 Results of operations. This section provides an analysis of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 to 2017 and December 31, 2017 to 2016. This analysis is presented on both a consolidated basis and on an operating segment basis. \n \u2022 Financial condition, liquidity and capital resources. This section provides an analysis of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, and our financial condition as of December 31, 2018, as well as a discussion of our liquidity and capital resources. \n \u2022 Critical accounting policies. This section discusses certain significant accounting policies considered to be important to our financial condition and results of operations and which require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in their application. In addition, all of our significant accounting policies, including our critical accounting policies, are summarized in Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein. \nOverview\nDescription of Business\nAffinion Holdings develops programs and solutions that motivate and inspire loyalty. Through our proprietary technology platforms and end-to-end customer service capabilities, we design, administer and fulfill loyalty and customer engagement programs and solutions that strengthen and expand the value of customer relationships for many of the world's largest and most respected companies. Our programs and solutions include:\n \u2022 Loyalty solutions that help reward, motivate and retain consumers. We create and manage any and all aspects of our clients' points-based loyalty programs, including design, platform, analytics, points management and fulfillment. Our loyalty solutions offer relevant, best-in-class rewards (such as travel, gift cards and merchandise) to consumers enabling clients to motivate, retain and thank their best customers. For example, our platform and technology support points-based programs for financial services, automotive, gaming, travel and hospitality companies. \n \u2022 Customer engagement programs and solutions that address key consumer needs such as greater peace of mind and meaningful savings for everyday purchases. We provide these solutions to leading companies in the financial institution, telecommunications, ecommerce, retail and travel sectors globally. These differentiated programs help our clients enrich their offerings to drive deeper connections with their customers, and to encourage their customers to engage more, stay loyal and generate more revenue for our clients. For example, we develop and manage programs such as identity theft protection, credit monitoring, savings on everyday purchases, concierge services, discount travel services and roadside assistance. \nThe Company had a domestic insurance business that served as a leading third-party agent, administrator and marketer of certain accident and life insurance solutions. As discussed further in Note 4-Discontinued Operations in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein, we completed the sale of the domestic insurance business, which comprised substantially all of our Insurance Solutions operating segment, on August 15, 2018. The divestiture of the domestic insurance business marked an additional step in our strategic plan and ongoing transformation into a pure-play loyalty solutions company.\nOur financial business model is characterized by substantial recurring revenues. We generate revenue primarily in three ways:\n \u2022 Fee for service: we generate revenues from our clients through our loyalty business by designing (management, analytics and customer experience) and administering points-based loyalty programs on a platform licensing, fee-for-service basis. We also generate revenues for desired customer engagement programs and solutions, typically through a licensing and/or per-user fee. \n \u2022 Commission or transaction fee: we earn a commission from our suppliers and/or a transaction fee from our clients based on volume for enabling or executing transactions such as fees generated from loyalty points related purchases and redemption. We can also generate revenues based on a per-subscriber and/or a per-activity commission fee from our clients for our services. \n \u2022 Subscription: we generate revenues through the sale of our value-added subscription-based programs and solutions to the customers of our clients whom we bill on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis. \nGlobal Reorganization\nEffective January 1, 2016, we implemented a new globalized organizational structure (the Global Reorganization\u201d) to better support our key strategic initiatives and enhance long-term revenue growth. This organizational structure allows us to combine similar lines of business on common platforms and shared infrastructures on a global basis to drive best practices and efficiencies with meaningful cost savings. In addition, we no longer materially invest in lines of business that we believe are not essential to our long-term growth prospects. We remain committed to our business strategy of pursuing initiatives that maintain and enhance our position as a global leader in loyalty and customer engagement solutions. The implementation of the Global Reorganization and divestiture of the domestic insurance business marked major steps in our strategic plan and ongoing transformation into a pure-play loyalty solutions company.\nWe have the following three operating segments:\n \u2022 Global Loyalty. This segment consists of all of our loyalty assets globally in which we are a provider of end-to-end loyalty solutions that help clients reward, enrich, motivate and retain customers, including program design, points management and administration, and broad-based fulfilment and redemption across multiple channels. \nIn this operating segment, we create and manage any and all aspects of our clients' loyalty programs including program design, program management, technology platform, data analytics, points administration and rewards fulfillment. We manage loyalty solutions for points-based loyalty programs for many large financial institutions and other significant businesses. We provide our clients with solutions that meet the most popular redemption options desired by their program points holders, including travel, gift cards and merchandise. Our loyalty programs are private-label, customizable, full-service rewards solutions that consist of a variety of configurations that are offered on a stand-alone and/or bundled basis depending on customer requirements.\nWe provide and manage reward products for loyalty programs through Connexions, our wholly-owned subsidiary, which is a service provider for points-based loyalty programs. We typically charge a per-subscriber and/or a per-activity administrative fee to clients for our services. Connexions also provides clients with the ability to offer leisure travel as a subscriber benefit in a purchase environment, and a travel gift card which can be used on all travel components, including airfare, rental car, hotel stays and cruise vacations.\n \u2022 Global Customer Engagement. This segment consists of our customer engagement business, in which we are a leading global solutions provider that delivers a flexible mix of benefits and services for our clients that meet customers' needs, including products that are designed to help consumers save money and gain peace of mind. \nThrough our global customer engagement operations, we create and manage innovative programs and solutions that address key consumer needs such as greater peace-of-mind and meaningful savings. We provide our solutions to leading companies in the financial institution, telecommunications, retail and travel sectors globally.\nOur customer engagement solutions may be categorized in two ways: (1) revenue enhancement, which is a traditional subscription-based model and (2) engagement solutions, which is a fee-for-service or transactional based model.\nIn the revenue enhancement model, we provide incremental services for our clients to monetize their customer base. We also partner with clients to customize benefits that resonate with their brand and their customers' needs.\nIn the engagement solutions model, we help clients differentiate their products and build strong customer relations. We also bundle appropriate rewards and benefits along the lifecycle of clients' customers to create intimate, reciprocal connections that drive purchase decisions, interaction and participation over time.\n \u2022 Legacy Membership and Package. This segment consists of certain global membership and package programs that are no longer being actively marketed but continue to be serviced and supported. This segment includes membership programs that were marketed with many of our large domestic financial institution partners. Although we will continue to service these members, we expect that cash flows and revenues will decrease over time due to the anticipated attrition of the member base in this operating segment. \nFactors Affecting Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nCompetitive Environment\nWe are a leading loyalty and customer engagement solutions company with value-added programs and services with a network of approximately 2,900 clients as of December 31, 2018, approximately 44.3 million subscribers and end-customers enrolled in our customer engagement and insurance programs worldwide and approximately 24.4 million customers who received credit or debit card enhancement services and loyalty points-based management and redemption services as of December 31, 2018. We believe our portfolio of programs and benefits is the broadest in the industry, and that we are capable of providing the full range of administrative services for loyalty points programs. At December 31, 2018, we offered 13 core products and services with 210 unique benefits and supported more than 4,100 versions of products and services representing different combinations of pricing, benefit configurations and branding.\nOur competitors include any company seeking direct and regular access to large groups of customers through any direct marketing channel, as well as any company capable of managing loyalty points programs or providing redemption options for those programs. Our products and services compete with those marketed by financial institutions and other third parties who have marketing relationships with our competition, including large, fully integrated companies that have financial, marketing and product development resources that are greater than ours. We compete for significant portfolios of large clients with needs that are suited to scalable servicing and that demand superior customer service and offerings for a material portion of their business. We face competition in all areas of our business, including price, product offerings and product performance. As a whole, the direct marketing services industry is extremely fragmented, while competition in loyalty points program administration is somewhat more concentrated. Most companies in the direct marketing services industry are relatively small and provide a limited array of products and services. In general, competition for the consumer's attention is intense, with a wide variety of players competing in different segments of the direct marketing industry. More specifically, competition within our business lines comes from companies that vary significantly in size, scope and primary core competencies.\nFinancial Industry Trends\nHistorically, financial institutions have represented a significant majority of our marketing partner base. Consumer banking is a highly regulated industry, with various federal, state and international authorities governing various aspects of the marketing and servicing of the products we offer through our financial institution partners.\nFor instance, Dodd-Frank mandates the most wide-ranging overhaul of financial industry regulation in decades. Dodd-Frank created the CFPB which became operational on July 21, 2011, and has been given authority to regulate all consumer financial products sold by banks and non-bank companies. These regulations have imposed additional reporting, supervisory, and regulatory requirements on our financial institution clients which have adversely affected our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, even an inadvertent failure of our financial institution clients to comply with these laws and regulations, as well as rapidly evolving social expectations of corporate fairness, could adversely affect our business or our reputation going forward. Some of our clients have become involved in governmental inquiries that include our products or marketing practices. As a result, certain financial institution clients have, and others could, delay or cease marketing with us, terminate their agreements with us, require us to cease providing services to subscribers, or require changes to our programs or solutions to subscribers that could also have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn certain circumstances, our financial institution clients have sought to source and market their own in-house programs and solutions, most notably programs and solutions that are analogous to our credit card registration, credit monitoring and identity-theft resolution programs and solutions. As we have sought to maintain our market share in these areas and to continue these programs and solutions with our clients, in some circumstances, we have shifted from a retail arrangement to a fee for service arrangement which results in lower net revenue, but unlike our retail arrangement, has no related commission expense, thereby preserving our ability to earn a suitable rate of return on the campaign.\nRegulatory Environment\nWe are subject to federal and state regulation as well as regulation by foreign authorities in other jurisdictions. Certain laws and regulations that govern our operations include: federal, state and foreign marketing and consumer protection laws and regulations; federal, state and foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulations; federal, state and foreign insurance and insurance mediation laws and regulations; and federal, state and foreign travel laws and regulations. Federal regulations are primarily enforced by the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Communications Commission and the CFPB. State regulations are primarily enforced by individual state attorneys general and insurance departments. Foreign regulations are enforced by a number of regulatory bodies in the relevant jurisdictions.\nThese regulations primarily impact the means we use to market our programs, which can reduce the acceptance rates of our solicitation efforts, impact our ability to obtain information from our members and end-customers and impact the benefits we provide and how we service our customers. In addition, new and contemplated regulations enacted by, or client settlement agreements or consent orders with, the CFPB could impose additional reporting, supervisory and regulatory requirements on, as well as result in inquiries of, us and our clients that could delay or terminate marketing campaigns with certain clients, impact the programs and solutions we provide to customers, and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe incur significant costs to ensure compliance with these regulations; however, we are party to lawsuits, including class action lawsuits, and regulatory investigations involving our business practices which also increase our costs of doing business. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\u201d\nSeasonality\nHistorically, seasonality has not had a significant impact on our business. Our revenues are more affected by the timing of marketing programs that can change from year to year depending on the opportunities available and pursued. More recently, in connection with the growth in our loyalty business, we have experienced increasing seasonality in the timing of our cash flows, particularly with respect to working capital. This has been due primarily to the consumer's increasing acceptance and use of certain categories for points redemptions, such as travel services and gift cards. These categories typically present a delay from the time we incur a cash outlay to provision the redemption until we are reimbursed by the client for the activity, and in certain instances, these delays may extend across multiple reporting periods. Redemptions for some categories, such as gift cards, have been weighted more heavily to the end of the year due to consumers' increasing usage of points in connection with seasonal gift giving.\nCompany History\nWe have over 40 years of operational history. We started offering membership products in 1973, and in 1985 began marketing insurance and package enhancement products. In 1988, we entered the loyalty solutions business and in the early 1990s, we started offering certain of our program offerings internationally.\nIn 2005, the Company was acquired by investment funds affiliated with Apollo Global Management, LLC through the consummation of the Apollo Transactions (as defined in -The Apollo Transactions\u201d).\nIn 2011, we entered into a merger agreement that resulted in the Webloyalty Acquisition and the acquisition of approximately 21% of the common stock of Affinion Holdings by investment funds affiliated with General Atlantic LLC (such investment funds referred to as General Atlantic\u201d) with the Apollo Funds continuing to own approximately 70% of the common stock of Affinion Holdings.\nOn November 9, 2015, we consummated the 2015 Exchange Offers, 2015 Rights Offering and Reclassification, each as defined and described below under -2015 Exchange Offers, 2015 Rights Offering and Reclassification.\u201d Upon consummation of the 2015 Exchange Offers, the Apollo Funds and General Atlantic ceased to have beneficial ownership of any common stock of Affinion Holdings. See Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters\u201d for information regarding the existing holders of 5% or more of the common stock of Affinion Holdings.\nOn May 10, 2017, we consummated the Credit Agreement Refinancing and International Notes Redemption, each as defined and described under -2017 Credit Agreement Refinancing and International Notes Redemption\u201d and the 2017 Exchange Offers, issuance of the 2017 Notes and 2017 Warrants pursuant to the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement and redemption of Affinion's 2010 senior notes, each as defined and described under -2017 Exchange Offers, Issuance of the 2017 Notes and 2017 Warrants and Redemptions of Other Existing Notes.\u201d On July 17, 2017, we consummated the issuance of the 2017 Notes and 2017 Warrants pursuant to the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement and redemption of the Investments senior subordinated notes and Affinion Holdings' 2013 senior notes.\nOn July 3, 2018, Affinion, Affinion Group, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the Seller\u201d) and indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Affinion, and Affinion Benefits Group, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of the Seller ( ABG\u201d), entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement\u201d) with AIS Holdco, LLC (the Purchaser\u201d), an entity controlled by investment funds managed by affiliates of Mill Point Capital Partners, L.P., pursuant to which the Purchaser would acquire the insurance division of the Company by acquiring the outstanding membership interests of ABG as set forth in the Purchase Agreement (the ABG Sale\u201d). On August 15, 2018, the Seller completed the ABG Sale pursuant to the Purchase Agreement.\nOn April 10, 2019, we consummated the 2019 Recapitalization, as defined and described below under Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-2019 Recapitalization\u201d and Note 22-Subsequent Events in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein.\nThe Apollo Transactions\nOn October 17, 2005, Cendant Corporation ( Cendant\u201d) completed the sale of the Predecessor to Affinion, an affiliate of Apollo Global Management, LLC (together with its subsidiaries, Apollo\u201d), pursuant to a purchase agreement dated July 26, 2005 for approximately $1.8 billion. The purchase price consisted of approximately $1.7 billion of cash, net of estimated closing adjustments, plus $125 million face value of 125,000 shares of newly issued preferred stock (with a fair value at issuance of $80.4 million) of Affinion Holdings, and a warrant (with a fair value at issuance of $16.7 million) that was exercisable for 4,437,170 shares of Affinion Holdings' common stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, and $38.1 million of transaction related costs (collectively, the Apollo Transactions\u201d). The warrants expired in 2011 and the remaining outstanding shares of preferred stock were redeemed in 2011.\nAs part of the Apollo Transactions, we made a special tax election referred to as a 338(h)(10) election\u201d with respect to the Predecessor. Under the 338(h)(10) election, the companies constituting the Predecessor were deemed to have sold and repurchased their assets at fair market value. By adjusting the tax basis in such assets to fair market value for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the aggregate amount of our tax deductions for depreciation and amortization have increased, which has reduced our cash taxes and further enhanced our free cash flow generation. We expect these tax deductions for U.S. federal income tax purposes to continue until 2020.\n2015 Exchange Offers, 2015 Rights Offering and Reclassification\nOn November 9, 2015, (a) Affinion Holdings completed a private offer to exchange (the 2015 Holdings Exchange Offer\u201d) its outstanding 13.75%/14.50% senior secured PIK/toggle notes due 2018 (Affinion Holdings' 2013 senior notes\u201d) for shares of Common Stock and (b) Affinion Investments completed a private offer to exchange (the 2015 Investments Exchange Offer\u201d and, together with the 2015 Holdings Exchange Offer, the 2015 Exchange Offers\u201d) its outstanding 13.50% senior subordinated notes due 2018 (the Investments senior subordinated notes\u201d) for shares of Common Stock of Affinion Holdings and (c) Affinion Holdings and Affinion International, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Affinion, jointly completed a rights offering (the 2015 Rights Offering\u201d) giving holders of Affinion Holdings' 2013 senior notes and Investments senior subordinated notes the right to purchase an aggregate principal amount of $110.0 million of International Notes and up to 2,483,333 shares of Common Stock for an aggregate cash purchase price of $110.0 million. Pursuant to the 2015 Holdings Exchange Offer, approximately $247.4 million of Affinion Holdings' 2013 senior notes were exchanged for 1,769,104 shares of Common Stock and pursuant to the 2015 Investments Exchange Offer, approximately $337.3 million of Investments senior subordinated notes were exchanged for 5,236,517 shares of Common Stock. Upon closing of the 2015 Exchange Offers, there remained outstanding approximately $13.1 million aggregate principal amount of Affinion Holdings' 2013 senior notes and $22.6 million aggregate principal amount of the Investments senior subordinated notes.\nIn connection with the 2015 Exchange Offers, Affinion Holdings and Affinion International jointly conducted the 2015 Rights Offering for International Notes and shares of Common Stock. The 2015 Rights Offering was for an aggregate principal amount of $110.0 million of International Notes and up to 2,483,333 shares of Common Stock. In connection with the 2015 Rights Offering, Empyrean Capital Partners, L.P. agreed to purchase any rights offering units that were unpurchased in the 2015 Rights Offering (the Backstop\u201d). Pursuant to the 2015 Rights Offering and the Backstop, Affinion International received cash of $110.0 million in exchange for $110.0 million aggregate principal amount of International Notes and 2,021,042 shares of Common Stock and a non-participating penny warrant (the Limited Warrant\u201d) to purchase up to 462,266 shares of Common Stock.\nUpon consummation of the 2015 Exchange Offers, the 2015 Consent Solicitations (as defined below) and the 2015 Rights Offering, Affinion Holdings effected a reclassification (the Reclassification\u201d and, together with the 2015 Exchange Offers, the 2015 Consent Solicitations, the 2015 Rights Offering and the related transactions, the 2015 Transactions\u201d) as follows. All of Affinion Holdings' then existing Class A Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the Class A Common Stock\u201d) (including Class A Common Stock issued as a result of a mandatory cashless exercise of all of its Series A Warrants (the Series A Warrants\u201d)), consisting of 84,842,535 outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock and 45,003,196 shares of Class A Common Stock underlying the Series A Warrants, was converted into (i) 490,083 shares of Affinion Holdings' Class C Common Stock, that upon conversion represented 5% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock on a fully diluted basis, and (ii) 515,877 shares of Affinion Holdings' Class D Common Stock, that upon conversion represented 5% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock on a fully diluted basis. In addition, Affinion Holdings' Series A Warrants and Affinion Holdings' Class B Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the Class B Common Stock\u201d) were eliminated from Affinion Holdings' certificate of incorporation and Affinion Holdings' Series B Warrants (the Series B Warrants\u201d) were cancelled for no additional consideration. In connection with the Reclassification, (i) the Apollo Funds received 218,002 shares of Class C Common Stock and 229,476 shares of Class D Common Stock, or 4.7% of the outstanding Common Stock on a beneficial ownership basis after giving effect to the conversion of the Class C/D Common Stock held by the Apollo Funds, and (ii) General Atlantic received 65,945 shares of Class C Common Stock and 69,415 shares of Class D Common Stock, or 1.5% of the outstanding Common Stock on a beneficial ownership basis after giving effect to the conversion of the Class C/D Common Stock held by General Atlantic.\nUpon consummation of the 2015 Exchange Offers, the Apollo Funds and General Atlantic ceased to have beneficial ownership of any Common Stock.\nThe consummation of the 2015 Exchange Offers and the 2015 Rights Offering resulted in an ownership change\u201d for the Company pursuant to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. This substantially limits our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards (including those attributable to the 2005 Acquisition) and certain other pre-change tax attributes to offset our post-change income. Similar rules and limitations may apply for state tax purposes as well.\n2017 Credit Agreement Refinancing and International Notes Redemption\nOn May 10, 2017, Affinion entered into a new credit facility (as amended, the Existing Credit Agreement\u201d) having a five year maturity with a lender, pursuant to which the lender provided term loans in an aggregate principal amount equal to approximately $1.3 billion and committed to provide revolving loans in an aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding not to exceed $110.0 million, decreasing to $80.0 million on May 10, 2018. The term loans provide for quarterly amortization payments totaling (i) for the first two years after May 10, 2017, 1% per annum, (ii) for the third year after May 10, 2017, 2.5% per annum, and (iii) for each year thereafter, 5% per annum, in each case, payable quarterly, with the balance due upon the final maturity date, subject in each case, to reduction of such amortization payments for certain prepayments. The Existing Credit Agreement also requires mandatory prepayments of the outstanding term loans based on excess cash flow (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement), if any, and the proceeds from certain specified transactions.\nThe proceeds of the term loans under the Existing Credit Agreement were used by Affinion to refinance its credit facility, which was amended and restated in May 2014, to redeem in full the International Notes, to pay transaction fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes.\nOn November 30, 2017, Affinion entered into the First Amendment to the Existing Credit Agreement, pursuant to which the parties (i) revised the Existing Credit Agreement in order for certain of the lenders under the revolving facility established thereunder to act as issuing banks in respect of letters of credit and as swingline lenders, (ii) modified certain provisions relating to the mechanics surrounding letters of credit and swingline loans, and (iii) set aggregate sub-limits for both letter of credit commitments and swingline commitments at $20.0 million.\nOn May 4, 2018, Affinion, as borrower, entered into the Second Amendment to the Existing Credit Agreement, pursuant to which Affinion amended the Existing Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the Second Amendment, the parties revised the Existing Credit Agreement in order to modify the date upon which the aggregate Revolving Facility Commitment is reduced from $110.0 million to $80.0 million. As a result of the Second Amendment, the date of such reduction was not to occur until August 10, 2018.\nOn July 16, 2018, Affinion, as borrower, entered into the Third Amendment to the Existing Credit Agreement, pursuant to which Affinion amended the Existing Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the Third Amendment, the parties revised the Existing Credit Agreement in order to (i) allow the Total Secured Leverage Ratio, for the purposes of the requirement of a 5.275x Total Secured Leverage Ratio for the ABG Sale, to be calculated net of cash received by Affinion from the ABG Sale, (ii) modify certain provisions relating to mandatory prepayments in order to allow for the application of the proceeds from the ABG Sale towards existing amortization payments such that amortization equals 0.25% per quarter through March 31, 2020, then increases to 0.625% per quarter through March 31, 2021 and finally increases to 1.25% per quarter thereafter, with remainder of the proceeds being applied to the bullet payment at maturity, (iii) modify the provision which contemplates an automatic reduction in the available revolving credit amount from $110.0 million to $80.0 million to delay such automatic reduction until May 10, 2021, (iv) create a permitted reinvestments basket which would allow for up to $50.0 million of the proceeds from the ABG Sale to be retained, subject to certain restrictions, including the requirement that such proceeds be held in a segregated account subject to the sole control of administrative agent, which shall only be released to Affinion (A) with the agent's consent or (B) if used to prepay Term Loans at 103% (with any such proceeds remaining after 9 months to be used to prepay Term Loans at 103%), (v) increase general call protection (for prepayments/acceleration not related to a change of control) to 2% upon the fourth anniversary of the closing of the Existing Credit Agreement, (vi) revise certain addbacks and Pro Forma Basis adjustments to reflect the projected change in EBITDA following the ABG Sale, (vii) reduce and/or delete certain negative covenant baskets and (viii) reduce certain material indebtedness and cross-default thresholds.\nIn addition to quarterly amortization payments, the Existing Credit Agreement required mandatory prepayments under certain conditions. First, a prepayment may be required based on excess cash flows as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement. For this purpose, excess cash flow for any annual accounting period is defined as Affinion's Adjusted EBITDA reduced by debt service, increases to working capital, capital expenditures and business acquisitions net of external funding and certain other uses of cash. Increases to excess cash flow include decreases to working capital and certain other receipts of cash. If the excess cash flow calculation for any annual accounting period is positive, a prepayment of the term loan facility in an amount equal to a percentage of the excess cash flow may be required. Such percentage is determined based upon the senior secured leverage ratio as of the end of the applicable annual accounting period. Second, a prepayment may be required with the net proceeds of certain asset sales. However, certain of such net proceeds will not be required to be applied to prepay the Existing Credit Agreement if they are applied to acquire, maintain, develop, construct, improve or repair assets useful in our business or to make acquisitions or other permitted investments within 12 months.\nOn May 10, 2017, Affinion International Holdings Limited ( Affinion International\u201d) (i) elected to redeem all of its outstanding $118.5 million aggregate principal amount of 7.5% Cash/PIK Senior Notes due 2018 (the International Notes\u201d) on June 9, 2017 at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount of the International Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, (ii) irrevocably deposited sufficient funds received from borrowings under the Existing Credit Agreement to effect such redemption with the trustee under the indenture governing the International Notes, and (iii) entered into a satisfaction and discharge agreement to discharge its obligations under the indenture governing the International Notes.

Interest on the International Notes was payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year, commencing on May 1, 2016. The International Notes Redemption was consummated on June 9, 2017.\n2017 Exchange Offers, Issuance of the 2017 Notes and 2017 Warrants and Redemptions of Other Existing Notes\nOn May 10, 2017, (a) Affinion completed a private offer to exchange or repurchase at the holder's election (collectively, the AGI Exchange Offer\u201d) Affinion's 7.875% senior notes due 2018 (Affinion's 2010 senior notes\u201d) for (i) new Senior Cash 12.5%/ PIK Step-Up to 15.5% Notes due 2022 of Affinion (the 2017 Notes\u201d) and new warrants (the 2017 Warrants\u201d) to acquire shares of Existing Common Stock or (ii) cash; (b) Affinion Holdings completed a private offer to exchange or repurchase at the holder's election (collectively, the Holdings Exchange Offer\u201d) Affinion Holdings' 2013 senior notes for (i) 2017 Notes and 2017 Warrants or (ii) cash; and (c) Affinion Investments completed a private offer to exchange or repurchase at the holder's election (collectively, the Investments Exchange Offer\u201d and, together with the AGI Exchange Offer and the Holdings Exchange Offer, the 2017 Exchange Offers\u201d) Affinion Investments' senior subordinated notes (the Investments senior subordinated notes together with Affinion's 2010 senior notes and Affinion Holdings' 2013 senior notes, the Existing Notes\u201d) for (i) 2017 Notes and 2017 Warrants or (ii) cash. Under the terms of the AGI Exchange Offer, for each $1,000 principal amount of Affinion's 2010 senior notes accepted in the AGI Exchange Offer, holders could elect to receive (i)(A) $1,000 principal amount of the 2017 Notes and 2017 Warrants to purchase 3.37 shares of Existing Common Stock or (B) $930 in cash.

Affinion used the proceeds of the 2017 Notes issued pursuant to the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement to pay the cash tender consideration to participating holders in the 2017 Exchange Offers.\nPreviously, in connection with the 2017 Exchange Offers, on March 31, 2017, affiliates of Elliott Management Corporation ( Elliott\u201d), Franklin Mutual Quest Fund, an affiliate of Franklin Mutual Advisers, LLC ( Franklin\u201d), affiliates of Empyrean Capital Partners, LP ( Empyrean\u201d) and Metro SPV LLC, an affiliate of ICG Strategic Equity Advisors LLC ( Metro SPV\u201d) (collectively, in such capacity, the Investors\u201d), all of whom were, at the time of the closing, or became, as a result of the 2017 Exchange Offers, Issuance of the 2017 Notes and 2017 Warrants and redemption of Affinion's 2010 senior notes, related parties, entered into an investor purchase agreement (the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement\u201d) with Affinion Holdings, Affinion and Affinion Investments, in which they agreed to purchase 2017 Notes and 2017 Warrants in an aggregate principal amount sufficient to pay all holders that participate in the 2017 Exchange Offers and elect to receive cash (the Initial Investment\u201d). Further, pursuant to the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement, if Affinion Holdings, Affinion or Affinion Investments exercised its option to redeem any of Affinion's 2010 senior notes, Affinion Holdings' 2013 senior notes and/or Investments senior subordinated notes not tendered in the 2017 Exchange Offers (the Follow-On Investment\u201d and, together with the Initial Investment, the Investment\u201d), the Company could obligate the Investors to purchase an aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes and 2017 Warrants that would yield sufficient cash proceeds to fund any such redemptions. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement, Affinion was required to pay to the Investors upon the closing of the 2017 Exchange Offers a commitment premium of $17.5 million and a funding premium of $7.4 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes and the same number of 2017 Warrants that such principal amount of the 2017 Notes would have been issued as part of the 2017 Exchange Offers, as described in more detail in Note 10-Long-Term Debt in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein.\nOn May 10, 2017, Affinion exercised its option to redeem Affinion's 2010 senior notes that were not tendered in the AGI Exchange Offer and to fund such redemption with proceeds from the Investors pursuant to the terms of the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement. As a result, on May 10, 2017, Affinion (i) elected to redeem all of its outstanding $205.3 million aggregate principal amount of Affinion's 2010 senior notes on May 15, 2017 at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, (ii) irrevocably deposited sufficient funds received from the Investors pursuant to the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement to effect such redemption with the trustee under the indenture governing Affinion's 2010 senior notes, and (iii) entered into a satisfaction and discharge agreement to discharge its obligations under the indenture governing Affinion's 2010 senior notes. Affinion's 2010 senior notes were originally issued by Affinion on November 19, 2010 in an aggregate principal amount of $475.0 million and bore interest at 7.875% per annum. The redemption of Affinion's 2010 senior notes was consummated on May 15, 2017.\nAccordingly, on May 10, 2017, Affinion issued approximately $532.6 million aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes and Affinion Holdings issued 2017 Warrants to purchase 3,974,581 shares of Existing Common Stock, of which (i) approximately $295.3 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes and 2017 Warrants to purchase 1,172,747 shares of Existing Common Stock were issued to participating holders (including the Investors) in the 2017 Exchange Offers, including $262.8 million of the 2017 Notes and 2017 Warrants to purchase 1,053,871 shares of Existing Common Stock issued to related parties, and (ii) approximately $237.3 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes and 2017 Warrants to purchase 2,801,834 shares of Existing Common Stock were issued, including all of the 2017 Notes and 2017 Warrants to purchase 2,791,475 shares of Existing Common Stock issued to the Investors, all of whom are related parties, pursuant to the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement to fund the cash consideration payable in the 2017 Exchange Offers and the cash redemption price for the balance of Affinion's 2010 senior notes that were not exchanged or tendered in the AGI Exchange Offer and to pay the commitment premium and funding premium under the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement. The 2017 Warrants received by the Investors on May 10, 2017, represented approximately 26.7% of the pro forma fully diluted ownership of Affinion Holdings after giving effect to issuances pursuant to the 2017 Exchange Offers and the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement, but without giving effect to options and restricted stock units granted under Affinion Holdings' management compensation and incentive plans. The number of shares of Existing Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the 2017 Warrants, as described herein, reflects the application of the anti-dilution protections of the 2017 Warrants issued in the 2017 Exchange Offers and pursuant to the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement (other than the 2017 Warrants issued as part of the funding premium) that are triggered by the issuance of 2017 Warrants as part of the funding premium.\nOn June 13, 2017, (i) Affinion Holdings exercised its option to redeem the $11.5 million in aggregate principal amount of Affinion Holdings' 2013 senior notes that were not tendered in the Holdings Exchange Offer and to fund such redemption with proceeds from the Investors pursuant to the terms of the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement and (ii) Affinion Investments exercised its option to redeem the $10.2 million in aggregate principal amount of the Investments senior subordinated notes that were not tendered in the Investments Exchange Offer and to fund such redemption with proceeds from the Investors pursuant to the terms of the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement. Affinion Holdings' 2013 senior notes were redeemed on July 17, 2017 at a redemption price of 103.4375% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date and the Investments senior subordinated notes were redeemed on July 17, 2017 at a redemption price of 103.375% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. Affinion Holdings' 2013 senior notes were originally issued by Affinion Holdings on December 12, 2013 in an aggregate principal amount of $292.8 million and bore interest at 13.75% per annum in cash, or at Affinion Holdings' option, in payment-in-kind interest at 13.75% per annum plus 0.75%. The Investments senior subordinated notes were originally issued by Affinion Investments on December 12, 2013 in an aggregate principal amount of $360.0 million and bore interest at 13.50% per annum.\nOn July 17, 2017, pursuant to the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement, Affinion issued approximately $23.7 million aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes to the Investors and Affinion Holdings issued 2017 Warrants to the Investors. Pursuant to the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement, the Investors paid a purchase price of approximately $23.5 million to Affinion, which amount includes the payment of pre-issuance accrued interest of approximately $0.6 million from May 10, 2017. The 2017 Notes and 2017 Warrants issued by Affinion and Affinion Holdings, respectively, to the Investors include the funding premium payable under the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement. The 2017 Notes constitute a further issuance of, and form a single series with, the $532.6 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes that Affinion issued on May 10, 2017.\nIn connection with the 2017 Exchange Offers and the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement, and in accordance with Affinion Holdings' obligations under the Shareholders Agreement, dated as of November 9, 2015 (as amended, the Shareholders Agreement\u201d), due to the issuance of the 2017 Warrants in the 2017 Exchange Offers and pursuant to the 2017 Investor Purchase Agreement, Affinion Holdings offered (the 2017 Pre-Emptive Rights Offer\u201d) to each holder of pre-emptive rights ( Pre-Emptive Rights Holder\u201d) the right to purchase with cash up to such Pre-Emptive Rights Holder's pro rata share (as determined in accordance with the Shareholders Agreement) of 2017 Warrants at an exercise price of $0.01 per 2017 Warrant pursuant to the 2017 Pre-Emptive Rights Offer. On July 12, 2017, Affinion Holdings issued 2017 Warrants to purchase 63,741 shares of Existing Common Stock to participants in the 2017 Pre-Emptive Rights Offer.\nThe consummation of the 2017 Exchange Offers resulted in an ownership change\u201d for the Company pursuant to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. This substantially limits our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards (including those attributable to the 2005 Acquisition) and certain other pre-change tax attributes to offset our post-change income. Similar rules and limitations may apply for state tax purposes as well.\n2018 Financing Transactions and the Second Lien Commitment Letter\nOn November 14, 2018, Affinion, as borrower, entered into the Fourth Amendment to the Existing Credit Agreement (the Fourth Amendment\u201d). The Fourth Amendment was entered into among Affinion, HPS Investment Partners, LLC, as administrative agent, the Required Lenders (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement), and for purposes of certain provisions contained therein, each other Loan Party party thereto, including Affinion Holdings, as guarantor.\nPursuant to the Fourth Amendment, the parties amended the Existing Credit Agreement, to among other things, (x) permit the immediate release of $45.0 million of the $50.0 million of the proceeds from the ABG Sale, (i) $32.0 million of which is able to be used by Affinion for working capital needs and/or to make an investment in one or more businesses, or capital expenditures or assets and (ii) $13.0 million of which will immediately be used to prepay outstanding term loans under the Existing Credit Agreement, together with the required premium in an amount equal to 3.00% of the aggregate principal amount being so prepaid and (y) to modify certain provisions in the Existing Credit Agreement in order to permit the Second Lien Facility Financing (as defined below), which will be secured on a second lien basis on the same collateral that secures the Existing Credit Agreement. In addition, the Fourth Amendment (i) authorizes the administrative agent under the Existing Credit Agreement to enter into an intercreditor agreement with respect to the Second Lien Facility Financing, (ii) provides that the prepayment or repayment of the next approximately $31.0 million in principal amount of term loans, other than regularly scheduled amortization payments, shall be accompanied by a prepayment premium equal to the greater of 3% and the prepayment premium that would otherwise have been payable in connection with such prepayment or repayment, and (iii) makes modifications to certain of the restrictive covenants contained in the Existing Credit Agreement.\nThe Fourth Amendment was conditioned upon, among other things, receipt of the Second Lien Commitment Letter (as defined below). We refer to the entry into the Fourth Amendment, the receipt of the Second Lien Commitment Letter and the transactions contemplated thereby as the 2018 Financing Transactions.\u201d\nOn November 14, 2018, Metro SPV, Elliott, Empyrean and Jefferies LLC ( Jefferies,\u201d with Metro SPV, Elliott, Empyrean and Jefferies collectively, the Second Lien Commitment Parties\u201d) delivered a commitment letter (the Second Lien Commitment Letter\u201d) to Affinion and Affinion Holdings. Pursuant to the Second Lien Commitment Letter, the Second Lien Commitment Parties have committed to provide revolving loans to Affinion under a revolving credit facility (the Second Lien Facility\u201d) in the original principal amount of approximately $20.5 million (the Commitment Financing\u201d), which amount may be increased, on or before June 30, 2019 at the option of Affinion and subject to the consent of the Second Lien Commitment Parties, by an amount of up to approximately $17.0 million (the Incremental Financing\u201d and, together with the Commitment Financing, the Second Lien Facility Financing\u201d), subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Second Lien Commitment Letter. Pursuant to the Second Lien Commitment Letter, on the closing date of the Second Lien Facility the Second Lien Commitment Parties will be paid an upfront closing fee in an amount equal to 12% of the amount of the Commitment Financing (which at Affinion's option, may be paid in the form of original issue discount). The Second Lien Commitment Parties will also be entitled to be paid the closing fee upon an Incremental Financing if consummated within a certain time period.\nCertain of the Second Lien Commitment Parties owned more than 5.0% of the outstanding common stock of Affinion Holdings. Accordingly, as a condition to Affinion and Affinion Holdings entering into the Second Lien Facility and other documents relating to the Second Lien Facility, such transactions with 5.0% or more holders of common stock must be approved by holders of at least 66-2/3% of the outstanding common stock of Affinion Holdings pursuant to the terms of the shareholders agreement between Affinion Holdings and the stockholders party thereto, dated as of November 9, 2015, as amended (the Shareholders Agreement\u201d). On November 14, 2018, in connection with the Second Lien Commitment Letter, certain stockholders representing greater than 66-2/3% of Affinion Holdings' common stock had delivered a written consent (the November 2018 Supermajority Stockholder Consent\u201d) approving the transactions contemplated by the Second Lien Commitment Letter. Pursuant to Regulation 14C under the Exchange Act and Section 228(e) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, on November 26, 2018, Affinion Holdings filed a definitive information statement on Schedule 14C (the Information Statement\u201d) to provide notice of the entry into the November 2018 Supermajority Stockholder Consent.\nPursuant to the Second Lien Credit Facility Commitment Letter, if funded, the Second Lien Facility will be secured on a second lien basis on the same collateral that secures the Existing Credit Agreement and will be guaranteed by Affinion Holdings and each subsidiary of Affinion that guarantees the Existing Credit Agreement. The Second Lien Facility will mature 91 days after the maturity date of the Existing Credit Agreement, but prior to the maturity of the 2017 Notes. The Second Lien Facility will contain substantially the same representations and warranties, covenants and events of default as those in the Existing Credit Agreement, subject to certain exceptions. Interest will be payable on the Second Lien Facility at the rate of 12.00% per annum payable in kind. Each of the Second\nLien Commitment Parties have agreed to provide the Second Lien Facility contemplated by the Second Lien Credit Facility Commitment; provided that, the Second Lien Commitment Parties have agreed that upon consummation of the 2019 Rights Offering, the Second Lien Commitment Parties will be entitled to (i) a repayment in cash equal to the actual amount funded in cash by such Second Lien Commitment Party under the Second Lien Facility, the amount of all interest actually paid in kind, accrued and unpaid interest, and the amount of all customary indemnity and expense reimbursement obligations due under the documentation for the Second Lien Facility, (ii) a repayment of amounts equal to the Closing Fee (as defined in the Second Lien Commitment Letter) in the form of New Notes (as defined below), (iii) a repayment of amounts equal to the Early Termination Fee (as defined in the Second Lien Commitment Letter) in the form of New Notes and (iv) the payment of any other fees, premiums or amounts (if any) owing to the Second Lien Commitment Parties under the Second Lien Facility in the form of New Notes (the repayment provisions specified in clauses (i) - (iv) collectively referred to as the Satisfaction and Discharge\u201d).\nThe Company had the right, but not the obligation, to enter into the Second Lien Facility prior to the closing of the 2019 Recapitalization. The Company did not exercise such right and accordingly did not enter into the Second Lien Facility.\n2019 Recapitalization\nOn March 4, 2019, noteholders of Affinion's outstanding 2017 Notes, which collectively held, as of such date, approximately $647 million (95%) aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 2017 Notes ( Consenting Noteholders\u201d), and the lenders holding approximately $904 million (96%) aggregate principal amount of the outstanding term loans and revolving loans under the Existing Credit Agreement (as defined below) (the Consenting Lenders\u201d and together, with the Consenting Noteholders and the Second Lien Commitment Parties, the Consenting Stakeholders\u201d) entered into an amended and restated support agreement (the Support Agreement\u201d) with Affinion Holdings, Affinion and certain other subsidiaries of the Company. Among other things, the Support Agreement contemplated (i) a private offer to exchange (the 2019 Exchange Offer\u201d) outstanding 2017 Notes for shares of Affinion Holdings' Class M common stock, par value $0.01 per share ( Class M Common Stock\u201d), which shares of Class M Common Stock were converted immediately following the consummation of the 2019 Exchange Offer as a result of the Merger (as described below) into shares of common stock ( New Common Stock\u201d), par value $0.000001 per share, of Affinion Holdings as the surviving entity, (ii) entry into the Amended Credit Agreement, (iii) a rights offering (the 2019 Rights Offering\u201d) giving tendering holders of the 2017 Notes and certain holders of Existing Common Stock the right to purchase an aggregate principal amount of $300.0 million of Affinion's new Senior PIK Notes due 2024 (the New Notes\u201d) for an aggregate cash purchase price of $300.0 million and (iv) the Second Lien Commitment Parties agreed to waive certain conditions and requirements under the Second Lien Commitment Letter and agreed to amend terms relating to the repayment of amounts outstanding under the Second Lien Facility and related fees, if funded, as set forth in the Support Agreement (collectively, the 2019 Recapitalization\u201d). Pursuant to the Support Agreement, each of the Consenting Noteholders agreed to tender its 2017 Notes in the 2019 Exchange Offer in exchange for the Class M Common Stock, New Penny Warrants, as applicable, and the right to participate in its pro rata share of the 2019 Rights Offering.\nOn April 10, 2019, Affinion Holdings completed the 2019 Recapitalization. To the extent that the issuance of New Common Stock to any investor or group of investors (whether as a result of participation in the 2019 Exchange Offer, the Pre-Emptive Rights Offer or pursuant to the Investor Purchase Agreement (as defined below)) would require the consent of, or notice to, any governmental authority (including the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority), and such consent or notice has not been obtained or delivered prior to the settlement of the 2019 Exchange Offer, new penny warrants ( New Penny Warrants\u201d) were issued in lieu of shares of New Common Stock. Pursuant to the 2019 Exchange Offer, approximately $670.8 million of the 2017 Notes were exchanged for 725,678 shares of New Common Stock and 10,522,940 New Penny Warrants. Upon closing of the 2019 Exchange Offer, there remained outstanding approximately $10.7 million aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes. Previously, on March 20, 2019, Affinion entered into Supplemental Indenture No. 1 (the Supplemental Indenture\u201d) between Affinion and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee (the 2017 Notes Trustee\u201d), to the indenture, dated as of May 10, 2017 (the 2017 Notes Indenture\u201d), among Affinion, the subsidiary guarantors named therein and the 2017 Notes Trustee, relating to the 2017 Notes. The Supplemental Indenture, which became operative on April 10, 2019, amended the 2017 Notes Indenture by (a) eliminating substantially all of the restrictive covenants, (b) making amendments to certain existing terms and (c) eliminating certain events of default and related provisions contained in the 2017 Notes Indenture.\nAs part of the 2019 Recapitalization, Affinion Holdings and Affinion jointly conducted the 2019 Rights Offering. The 2019 Rights Offering was for an aggregate principal amount of $300.0 million of New Notes. In connection with the 2019 Rights Offering, affiliates of Elliott Management Corporation ( Elliott\u201d), Metro SPV LLC, an affiliate of ICG Strategic Equity Advisors LLC ( Metro SPV\u201d), Mudrick Capital Management, LP ( Mudrick\u201d), affiliates of Empyrean Capital Partners, L.P. ( Empyrean\u201d) and Corbin Capital Partners, L.P. (collectively, in such capacity, the Financing Parties\u201d) entered into the amended and restated investor purchase agreement (the Investor Purchase Agreement\u201d) with Affinion Holdings and Affinion, whereby the Financing Parties (or affiliates of the Financing Parties) agreed to purchase from Affinion an aggregate principal amount of New Notes that were unpurchased in the 2019 Rights Offering. On the closing of the 2019 Exchange Offer, the Company paid the Financing Parties, in accordance with the terms of the Investor Purchase Agreement, a financing premium of (i) $57.0 million in aggregate principal amount of New Notes and (ii) New Common Stock equal to 12.5% of the outstanding New Common Stock, after giving effect to the 2019 Exchange Offer, the Merger, the 2019 Pre-Emptive Rights Offer and the payment of such financing premium (but before giving effect to any dilution from\na new management incentive plan (the New MIP\u201d) and the New Investor Warrants). Pursuant to the 2019 Rights Offering and the Investor Purchase Agreement, Affinion received gross cash proceeds of $300.0 million in exchange for $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of New Notes.\nIn connection with the consummation of the 2019 Recapitalization, on April 10, 2019, we entered into certain amendments to the Existing Credit Agreement to (i) obtain an extension of the maturity of the Revolving Facility Commitments (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) and Term Loans (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) existing immediately prior to the consummation of the 2019 Recapitalization and (ii) modify certain other provisions in the Existing Credit Agreement.\nIn connection with the 2019 Exchange Offer, on February 28, 2019, the holders of 66-2/3% of the issued and outstanding warrants (the 2017 Warrants\u201d) to purchase common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Affinion Holdings (the Existing Common Stock\u201d), issued pursuant to that certain Warrant Agreement, dated as of May 10, 2017, by and between Affinion Holdings and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, as transfer agent (the 2017 Warrant Agreement\u201d), consented to an amendment to the 2017 Warrant Agreement as a result of which the 2017 Warrants, if unexercised, were mandatorily cashlessly exercised immediately following the consummation of the 2019 Exchange Offer but immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger (as defined below). Certain Consenting Stakeholders exercised their warrants using full physical settlement, subject to, and effective immediately following, the consummation of the 2019 Exchange Offer but immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger. In addition, Metro SPV exercised for cash its Limited Warrant effective immediately following the consummation of the 2019 Exchange Offer but immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger.\nImmediately following the consummation of the 2019 Exchange Offer and the exercises of the 2017 Warrants and the Limited Warrant, AGHI Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and direct wholly owned subsidiary of Affinion Holdings ( Merger Sub\u201d), merged with and into Affinion Holdings with Affinion Holdings as the surviving entity (the Merger\u201d). The Merger was approved by the board of directors and stockholders of each of Affinion Holdings and Merger Sub. As a result of the Merger, (i) each holder of Class C Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Affinion Holdings or Class D Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Affinion Holdings (the Class C/D Common Stock\u201d) received for each share of Class C/D Common Stock cash equal to $0.01 per share of Class C/D Common Stock held thereby, (ii) each holder of Existing Common Stock, including as a result of the exercise of 2017 Warrants and the Limited Warrant as described above, received for each share of Existing Common Stock 0.089809 New Investor Warrants to be issued by Affinion Holdings (the New Investor Warrants\u201d) and (iii) each holder of Class M Common Stock received for each share of Class M Common Stock one share of New Common Stock of the surviving entity. In connection with the issuance of the Class M Common Stock, the Company and its stockholders approved amendments to Affinion Holdings' Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to create a new class of common stock, designated as Class M Common Stock,\u201d having par value $0.01 per share (the Charter Amendment\u201d) and Fourth Amended and Restated By-laws (the By-laws\u201d) to make them consistent with provisions of the Charter Amendment (the By-laws Amendment\u201d).\nPursuant to the Investor Warrant Agreement, dated as of April 10, 2019, by and between Affinion Holdings and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, as warrant agent (the New Investor Warrant Agreement\u201d), each New Investor Warrant is exercisable for one share of New Common Stock at any time, subject to required regulatory approval and filings applicable to the holder of a New Investor Warrant. In order to exercise its New Investor Warrant, a holder of New Investor Warrants will need to submit an exercise notice to Affinion Holdings, together with the exercise price equal of $67.12 per share. The New Investor Warrants will be immediately exercisable upon issuance at the option of the holders thereof, and will be mandatorily redeemable by Affinion Holdings on the fifth year anniversary of the initial issuance thereof, for $0.01 per share. New Investor Warrants will not be exercisable if the recipient of the New Common Stock to be issued upon exercise has failed to obtain any required consents or waivers from, or failed to file any required notices with, any applicable governmental agency, including the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority. The New Investor Warrants will not be entitled to participate in dividends on New Common Stock but instead will benefit from customary anti-dilution protections that result in an adjustment of the conversion price when and if dividends, distributions or stock buy-backs are effected. In addition to the anti-dilution adjustments to exercise price in the event of dividends and distributions declared and paid on New Common Stock, the New Investor Warrant has limited and customary anti-dilution adjustments for stock dividends, splits, reverse-splits, reclassifications, reorganizations and similar transformative transactions that alter, amend or modify the New Common Stock.\nUpon exercise of New Investor Warrants, such holders will be required to execute joinders to the New Stockholders Agreement (as defined below).\nThe consummation of the 2019 Recapitalization resulted in an ownership change\u201d for the Company pursuant to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. This substantially limits our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards (including those attributable to the 2005 Acquisition) and certain other pre-change tax attributes.\nThe Company is evaluating the accounting for the 2019 Recapitalization, including the treatment of debt issuance costs, for which there will be significant charges that impact future periods.\nResults of Operations\nSupplemental Data\nWe manage our business using a portfolio approach, meaning that we allocate our investments in the ongoing pursuit of the highest and best available returns, allocating our resources to whichever products, services, geographies and programs offer the best opportunities. With the globalization of our clients, programs and solutions and the ongoing refinement and execution of our capital allocation strategy, we have developed the following table that we believe captures the way we look at the businesses (amounts in thousands, except dollars per unit).\n\n (1) Gross Transactional Sales Volume primarily includes the gross sales amount of travel bookings, gift cards and merchandise redeemed by customers of our clients' programs that we support and excludes cash redemptions and revenue generated from programming, platform, administration and other non-transactional services. Gross Transactional Sales Volume per Transaction is calculated by taking the Gross Transactional Sales Volume reported for the period and dividing it by the total transactions for the same period. \n (2) Average Subscribers and Average Legacy Members for the period are all calculated by determining the average subscribers or members, as applicable, for each month in the period (adding the number of subscribers or members, as applicable, at the beginning of the month with the number of subscribers or members, as applicable, at the end of the month and dividing that total by two) and then averaging that result for the period. A subscriber's or member's, as applicable, account is added or removed in the period in which the subscriber or member, as applicable, has joined or cancelled. \n (3) Annualized Net Revenue per Average Subscriber and Legacy Member are all calculated by taking the revenues from subscribers or members, as applicable, for the period and dividing it by the average subscribers or members, as applicable, for the period. Quarterly periods are then multiplied by four to annualize this amount for comparative purposes. Upon cancellation of a subscriber or member, as applicable, the subscriber's or member's, as applicable, revenues are no longer recognized in the calculation. \nSegment and Adjusted EBITDA\nSegment EBITDA consists of income from operations before depreciation and amortization. Segment EBITDA is the measure management uses to evaluate segment performance and we present Segment EBITDA to enhance your understanding of our operating performance. We use Segment EBITDA as one criterion for evaluating our performance relative to that of our peers. We believe that Segment EBITDA is an operating performance measure, and not a liquidity measure, that provides investors and analysts with a measure of operating results unaffected by differences in capital structures, capital investment cycles and ages of related assets among otherwise comparable companies. However, Segment EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under U.S. GAAP (as defined in Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein), and Segment EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. You should not consider Segment EBITDA as an alternative to operating or net income determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of cash flows, or as a measure of liquidity.\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA for each segment provides supplemental information useful to investors as it is frequently used by the financial community to analyze performance period to period, to analyze a company's ability to service its debt and to facilitate comparisons among companies. We believe Adjusted EBITDA also provides additional supplemental information to compare results among our segments. However, Adjusted EBITDA by segment is not a measurement of financial performance under U.S. GAAP, and Adjusted EBITDA by segment may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. You should not consider Adjusted EBITDA by segment as an alternative to operating or net income determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of cash flows, or as a measure of liquidity.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\n\nSummary of Operating Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nThe following is a summary of changes affecting our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nNet revenues decreased $24.3 million, or 3.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the same period of the prior year primarily from lower retail revenues from a decline in retail member volumes in Legacy Membership and Package. Increased growth with existing clients and launches with new clients in Global Loyalty was partially offset by the impact of the loss of a top 5 loyalty partner in the fourth quarter.\nSegment EBITDA decreased $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the same period of the prior year as the impact of lower net revenues and higher general and administrative expense was partially offset by lower marketing and commissions expense and lower operating costs.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nThe following section provides an overview of our consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nNet Revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we reported net revenues of $699.8 million, a decrease of $24.3 million, or 3.4%, as compared to net revenues of $724.1 million in the same period of the prior year. Global Loyalty net revenues increased $14.2 million primarily due to increased growth with existing clients and launches with new clients, partially offset by the impact of the loss of a top 5 loyalty partner in the fourth quarter. Net revenues increased $1.8 million in Global Customer Engagement primarily from the favorable impact of foreign exchange. Net revenues in Legacy Membership and Package decreased $40.3 million primarily due to the expected attrition of legacy members, including those from our large financial institution partners, principally due to the cessation of new marketing campaigns and terminated programs with those partners as a result of the regulatory issues that have negatively impacted these partners. We expect this downward trend in net revenues related to our financial institution partners to continue for the foreseeable future. Net revenues further decreased from lower package revenue primarily the result of lower average package members.\nMarketing and Commissions Expense. Marketing and commissions expense decreased $30.7 million, or 17.7%, to $142.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $173.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Marketing and commissions expense in Legacy Membership and Package decreased $16.9 million primarily due to lower commissions principally due to the decline in the member base. Marketing and commissions expense in Global Customer Engagement decreased $10.5 million primarily due to lower employee-related costs.\nOperating Costs. Operating costs decreased $21.0 million, or 6.0%, to $331.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $352.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Operating costs in Legacy Membership and Package decreased $12.2 million primarily from lower product and servicing costs associated with the lower retail member volumes. Operating costs in Global Loyalty decreased $9.6 million primarily from a charge of $23.2 million recorded in relation to the cyber theft that occurred in the first quarter of 2017, partially offset by higher servicing costs related to the higher net revenues and additional investments, including the opening of a new call center.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense increased $27.9 million, or 32.5% to $113.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $85.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Corporate costs increased $24.4 million primarily due to higher employee-related costs, principally severance.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $48.2 million from $45.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily from an increase in amortization expense of $1.7 million principally the result of intangible assets acquired in 2018 as well as from an increase in depreciation expense of $1.2 million principally the result of an increase in capitalized software put into service.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased $54.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of restructuring our debt on May 10, 2017, whereby we entered into the Existing Credit Agreement for term loans totaling $1.34 billion and revolving loans. The proceeds were used to refinance our existing senior secured credit facility and redeem in full our outstanding International Notes. We also completed a private offer to exchange or repurchase Affinion's 2010 senior notes, Affinion Holdings' 2013 senior notes and the Investments senior subordinated notes for the 2017 Notes and 2017 Warrants to acquire Existing Common Stock. The new debt issues are at higher principal amounts with associated higher interest rates.\nGain (Loss) on Extinguishment of Debt. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a loss in the amount of $32.0 million as a result of the prepayment of long-term debt immediately following the closing of the ABG Sale.\nIncome Tax Benefit. Income tax benefit decreased $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to the estimated decrease in the state and foreign deferred tax provisions, partially offset by an increase in the current state and foreign tax provisions and an increase in the federal deferred tax provision for the same period.\nThe Company's effective income tax rates for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were 15.8% and 37.2%, respectively. The difference in the effective tax rates for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is primarily a result of the change in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the TCJA\u201d), coupled with the increase in the loss before income taxes and non-controlling interest from $73.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $171.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, and a decrease in the income tax benefit from $27.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $27.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Company's tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amount of income it earns in those jurisdictions. It is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year, but are not consistent from year to year. The requirement to maintain valuation allowances also had an impact on the difference in the Company's effective tax rates.\nIncome (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, net of tax. Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax increased $426.3 million to $447.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $21.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to a gain on sale, net of tax of $443.0 million recorded upon completion of the sale of the domestic insurance business, partially offset by a decrease in income from discontinued operations, net of tax of $16.7 million due to the timing of the closing of the sale of the domestic insurance business.\nOperating Segment Results\nNet revenues, Segment EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA by operating segment are as follows:\n\n\n (1) See - Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources - Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below and Note 19-Segment Information in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein for a discussion on Segment EBITDA. \nGlobal Loyalty. Net revenues from Global Loyalty increased $14.2 million, or 6.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $239.3 million as compared to $225.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to increased growth with existing clients and launches with new clients, partially offset by the impact of the loss of a top 5 loyalty partner in the fourth quarter.\nSegment EBITDA increased $23.2 million, or 36.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of a charge of $23.2 million recorded in relation to the cyber theft that occurred in the first quarter of 2017. The impact of higher net revenues principally driven by growth with existing clients and launches with new clients was offset by the impact of the loss of a top 5 loyalty partner in the fourth quarter as well as by higher servicing costs.\nGlobal Customer Engagement. Global Customer Engagement net revenues increased $1.8 million, or 0.5%, to $361.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $359.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Net revenues increased $5.0 million from the favorable impact of foreign exchange. On a currency consistent basis, net revenues decreased $3.2 million.\nSegment EBITDA increased $6.3 million, or 11.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of an increase in net revenues of $1.8 million and a decrease in operating expenses of $4.3 million, principally due to lower employee-related costs.\nLegacy Membership and Package. Legacy Membership and Package net revenues decreased $40.3 million, or 28.8%, to $99.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $139.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Net revenues decreased primarily from the expected attrition of legacy members, including those from our large financial institution partners, principally due to the cessation of new marketing campaigns and terminated programs with those partners as a result of the regulatory issues that have negatively impacted such partners. We expect this downward trend in net revenues related to our financial institution partners to continue for the foreseeable future. Net revenues further decreased from lower package revenue primarily the result of lower average package members.\nSegment EBITDA decreased $5.2 million, or 13.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Segment EBITDA decreased as the impact from the lower net revenues of $40.3 million was partially offset by lower marketing and commissions expense of $16.9 million, lower operating costs of $12.2 million and lower general and administrative expense of $6.2 million. The decrease in marketing and commissions expense was primarily due to lower commissions principally due to the decline in the member base. The decrease in operating costs was the result of lower product and servicing costs related to the decrease in net revenues. The decrease in general and administrative expense was primarily due to cost saving initiatives and lower fees related to certain legal matters.\nCorporate. Corporate costs include certain departmental service costs such as human resources, legal, corporate finance and accounting functions and unallocated portions of information technology. Expenses such as professional fees related to debt financing activities and stock compensation costs are also recorded in corporate. Corporate costs increased $28.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to higher employee-related costs, principally severance.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\n\nSummary of Operating Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nThe following is a summary of changes affecting our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nNet revenues decreased $17.9 million, or 2.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period of the prior year primarily the result of lower retail revenues from a decline in retail member volumes in Legacy Membership and Package, lower revenue in Global Loyalty primarily from the loss of a key client in 2015, and lower revenue in Global Customer Engagement primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, as well as the timing of marketing campaign launches and product launches with new clients.\nSegment EBITDA decreased $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period of the prior year as the impact of lower net revenues and higher operating costs was partially offset by lower marketing and commissions expense and general and administrative expense.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nThe following section provides an overview of our consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNet Revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2017 we reported net revenues of $724.1 million, a decrease of $17.9 million, or 2.4%, as compared to net revenues of $742.0 million in the comparable period of 2016. Global Loyalty net revenues increased $58.1 million primarily due to increased growth with existing clients and launches with new clients. Net revenues decreased $27.0 million in Global Customer Engagement primarily from lower net revenues in our engagement solutions business, which was principally due to the timing of product launches with new clients, lower revenue in our revenue enhancement business and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $4.2 million. Net revenues in Legacy Membership and Package decreased $50.0 million primarily due to the expected attrition of legacy members, including those from our large financial institution partners, principally due to the cessation of new marketing campaigns and terminated programs with those partners as a result of the regulatory issues that have negatively impacted these partners. We expect this downward trend in net revenues related to our financial institution partners to continue for the foreseeable future. Net revenues further decreased from lower package revenue primarily the result of lower average package members.\nMarketing and Commissions Expense. Marketing and commissions expense decreased $27.3 million, or 13.6%, to $173.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $200.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Marketing and commissions expense in Global Customer Engagement decreased $12.5 million primarily due to lower volumes partially offset by higher commissions resulting from a migration of certain partner commission arrangements from traditional bounty to advance commissions whereby the partner has the potential for additional revenue sharing. Marketing and commissions expense in Legacy Membership and Package decreased $17.2 million primarily due to lower commissions principally due to the decline in the member base.\nOperating Costs. Operating costs increased $33.9 million, or 10.6%, to $352.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $318.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Operating costs in Global Loyalty increased $49.5 million primarily from higher servicing costs related to the higher net revenues, including the opening of a new call center in the fourth quarter, and a charge of $23.2 million recorded in relation to the cyber theft that occurred in the first quarter of 2017. The charge includes costs associated with customer remediation of the cyber theft and costs related to a commercial dispute with a gift card provider. An insurance claim related to the cyber theft is currently being pursued with our carriers and we expect a recovery in a future period which will be recorded when realizable. Operating costs in Legacy Membership and Package decreased $12.8 million primarily from lower product and servicing costs associated with the lower retail member volumes.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense decreased $23.3 million, or 21.4% to $85.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $109.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. General and administrative expense in Legacy Membership and Package decreased $18.5 million primarily due to lower reserves and fees related to certain legal matters. Corporate costs decreased $8.6 million primarily due to cost savings initiatives, lower employee incentive plan costs and the favorable impact of unrealized foreign exchange on intercompany borrowings. General and administrative expense in Global Customer Engagement increased $5.8 million primarily due to higher professional fees and provisions recorded related to the collectability of certain customer receivables.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $10.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $45.3 million from $55.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily from a decrease in depreciation expense of $5.3 million principally the result of fully depreciating significant capital projects in 2017. In addition, amortization expense decreased by $4.7 million related to lower amortization of intangible assets acquired in various acquisitions, principally member relationships, which are amortized on an accelerated basis.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased $68.0 million, or 90.9% to $142.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $74.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as a result of restructuring our debt on May 10, 2017, whereby we entered into the Existing Credit Agreement for term loans totaling $1.34 billion and revolving loans. The proceeds were used to refinance our existing senior secured credit facility and redeem in full our outstanding International Notes. We also completed a private offer to exchange or repurchase Affinion's 2010 senior notes, Affinion Holdings' 2013 senior notes and the Investments senior subordinated notes for the 2017 Notes and 2017 Warrants to acquire Existing Common Stock. The new debt issues are at higher principal amounts with associated higher interest rates.\nGain on Extinguishment of Debt. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a gain in the amount of $3.5 million as a result of restructuring our debt on May 10, 2017 and July 17, 2017.\nIncome Tax Benefit (Provision). Income tax expense decreased $30.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the SAB 118 estimated decrease in the federal and state deferred tax provisions related to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and a decrease in the current foreign and federal tax provisions, partially offset by an increase in the current federal and state tax provisions and the foreign deferred tax provision for the same period.\nThe Company's effective income tax rates for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were 37.2% and (19.8)%, respectively. The difference in the effective tax rates for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is primarily a result of the increase in the loss from continuing operations before income taxes to $73.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $16.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and the change in the income tax provision from $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to an income tax benefit of $27.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflects the estimated impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of $25.5 million which includes the impact on deferred taxes of the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate to 21% and the impact on our valuation allowance assessment. The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2017 also includes the impact on the state tax provision for those states with current conformity to the Internal Revenue Code. The Company's tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amount of income it earns in those jurisdictions. It is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year, but are not consistent from year to year. In addition to the state and foreign income taxes, the requirement to maintain valuation allowances had the most significant impact on the difference between the Company's effective tax rate and the former statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of 35%.\nIncome (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, net of tax. Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax decreased $15.1 million to $21.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $36.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to increased interest expense, principally driven by higher interest rates as a result of restructuring our debt on May 10, 2017 and due to an increased income tax provision, principally due to an increase in taxable income as a result of intra-period allocation requirements under U.S. GAAP.\nOperating Segment Results\nNet revenues, Segment EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA by operating segment are as follows:\n\n\n (1) See - Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources - Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below and Note 19-Segment Information in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein for a discussion on Segment EBITDA. \nGlobal Loyalty. Net revenues from Global Loyalty increased $58.1 million, or 34.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $225.1 million as compared to $167.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to increased growth with existing clients and launches with new clients.\nSegment EBITDA increased $7.6 million, or 13.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, as the impact of the higher net revenue was partially offset by higher servicing costs, including the opening of a new call center in the fourth quarter, and a charge of $23.2 million recorded in relation to the cyber theft that occurred in the first quarter of 2017. The charge includes costs associated with customer remediation of the cyber theft and costs related to a commercial dispute with a gift card provider. An insurance claim related to the cyber theft is currently being pursued with our carriers and we expect a recovery in a future period which will be recorded when realizable.\nGlobal Customer Engagement. Global Customer Engagement net revenues decreased $27.0 million, or 7.0%, to $359.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $386.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net revenues decreased $4.2 million from the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. On a currency consistent basis, net revenues decreased $22.8 million primarily from lower net revenues in our engagement solutions business principally due to the timing of product launches with new clients, as well as lower revenue in our revenue enhancement business.\nSegment EBITDA decreased $15.4 million, or 21.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 as the lower net revenues of $27.0 million and higher general and administrative expense of $5.8 million were partially offset by lower marketing and commissions expense of $12.5 million and lower operating costs of $4.9 million. The lower marketing and commissions expense was primarily attributable to lower volumes partially offset by higher commissions resulting from a migration of certain partner commission arrangements from traditional bounty to advance commissions whereby the partner has the potential for additional revenue sharing. The lower operating costs were primarily related to lower product costs and the favorable impact of foreign exchange. The higher general and administrative expense was primarily due to higher professional fees and provisions recorded related to the collectability of certain customer receivables.\nLegacy Membership and Package. Legacy Membership and Package net revenues decreased $50.1 million, or 26.4%, to $139.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $189.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net revenues decreased primarily from the expected attrition of legacy members, including those from our large financial institution partners, principally due to the cessation of new marketing campaigns and terminated programs with those partners as a result of the regulatory issues that have negatively impacted such partners. We expect this downward trend in net revenues related to our financial institution partners to continue for the foreseeable future. Net revenues further decreased from lower package revenue primarily the result of lower average package members.\nSegment EBITDA decreased $1.2 million, or 2.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Segment EBITDA decreased as the impact from the lower net revenues of $50.1 million was partially offset by lower marketing and commissions expense of $17.2 million, lower operating costs of $12.8 million and lower general and administrative expense of $18.5 million. The lower marketing and commissions expense was primarily due to lower commissions principally due to the decline in the member base. The lower operating costs are the result of lower product and servicing costs related to the lower revenue. The lower general and administrative expense was primarily due to lower reserves and fees related to certain legal matters.\nCorporate. Corporate costs include certain departmental service costs such as human resources, legal, corporate finance and accounting functions and unallocated portions of information technology. Expenses such as professional fees related to debt financing activities and stock compensation costs are also recorded in corporate. Corporate costs decreased $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily the result of cost savings initiatives, lower employee incentive plan costs and the favorable impact of unrealized foreign exchange on intercompany borrowings.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nFinancial Condition - December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017\n\nTotal assets decreased $84.9 million, primarily due to decreases in current assets held for sale and non-current assets held for sale of $46.0 million and $83.3 million, respectively, from the completion of the ABG Sale, partially offset by an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $45.2 million principally due to the retention of a portion of sale proceeds from the ABG Sale.\nTotal liabilities decreased $385.1 million, primarily due to the repayment of $466.7 million of long-term debt immediately following the closing of the ABG Sale and decreases in current liabilities held for sale and non-current liabilities held for sale of $49.1 million and $7.6 million, respectively, from the completion of the ABG Sale, partially offset by payment-in-kind interest of $86.2 million and additional borrowings of $45.0 million under the Company's revolving credit facility.\nTotal deficit decreased $300.2 million, primarily due to net income of $302.1 million, the retained deficit impact of a change in accounting policy of $1.6 million and share based compensation of $1.7 million, partially offset by the impact of currency translation adjustment of $5.4 million.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity on both a short-term and long-term basis are cash on hand and cash generated through operating and financing activities. Our primary cash needs are to service our indebtedness and for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. Many of the Company's significant costs are variable in nature, including marketing and commissions. The Company has a great degree of flexibility in the amount and timing of marketing expenditures and focuses its marketing expenditures on its most profitable marketing opportunities. Commissions correspond directly with revenue generated and have been decreasing as a percentage of revenue over the last several years.\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 205-40, Going Concern, management has the responsibility to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date that these consolidated financial statements are issued. In connection therewith, management evaluated relevant conditions and events known at the date these consolidated financial statements were issued, including the consummation of the 2019 Recapitalization (as defined below) which resulted in, among other effects (i) an approximately $39.3 million reduction in estimated cash interest costs for 2019, (ii) $27.3 million of additional liquidity upon closing, (iii) the elimination of principal amortization payments due on 2019 Term Loans (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) through December 31, 2021 and (iv) certain amendments to financial covenant requirements, as well as the impact of the loss of one of the Company's top five Global Loyalty clients during 2018 and our overall liquidity needs. After consideration of these relevant conditions and events, among others, Management concluded that the 2019 Recapitalization alleviated the substantial doubt regarding the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date that these consolidated financial statements were issued that had existed prior to the consummation of the 2019 Recapitalization.\nOn February 19, 2019, a cash interest payment of approximately $22.2 million was due under the Existing Credit Agreement. On February 26, 2019, Affinion entered into a forbearance agreement (the First Forbearance Agreement\u201d) with the requisite lenders under the Existing Credit Agreement in which such requisite lenders agreed to forbear from taking any action with respect to the failure of Affinion to pay interest on the loans as required under the Existing Credit Agreement on February 19, 2019, (the Interest Payment Date\u201d) that would otherwise constitute a default under the Existing Credit Agreement and constitute an event of default under Section 7.01(c) of the Existing Credit Agreement if not paid within five business days of the Interest Payment Date until the earlier of March 5, 2019 and the occurrence of a termination event under the First Forbearance Agreement.\nOn March 1, 2019, Affinion entered into a forbearance agreement (the Second Forbearance Agreement\u201d) in connection with the Support Agreement with the requisite lenders under the Existing Credit Agreement in which such requisite lenders agreed to forbear from taking any action with respect to the failure of Affinion to (i) pay interest on the loans as required under the Existing Credit Agreement on the Interest Payment Date that would otherwise constitute a default under the Existing Credit Agreement and constitute an event of default under Section 7.01(c) of the Existing Credit Agreement if not paid within five business days of the Interest Payment Date, (ii) deliver audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 that are not qualified in any material respect on or prior to the date that is 90 days after December 31, 2018 that would otherwise constitute a default and, if not remedied within 5 days after notice from the agent under the Existing Credit Agreement, would constitute an event of default and (iii) comply with the requirements of Section 5.13 of the Existing Credit Agreement that would otherwise constitute a default and, if not remedied within 30 days after notice from the agent under the Existing Credit Agreement, would constitute an event of default, in each case until June 3, 2019. On March 22, 2019, Affinion entered into an amendment to the Second Forbearance Agreement to add to the list of specified defaults and/or events of default under the Existing Credit Agreement with respect to which requisite lenders agree to forbear from taking any action until the earlier of June 3, 2019 and certain events of termination, the failure of Affinion to make any additional scheduled payments of interest and principal under the Existing Credit Agreement through June 3, 2019.\nAffinion Holdings is a holding company, with no direct operations and no significant assets other than the ownership of 100% of the stock of Affinion. Because we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries, our cash flows and our ability to service our indebtedness is dependent upon cash dividends and distributions or other transfers from our subsidiaries. Payments to us by our subsidiaries are contingent upon our subsidiaries' earnings, but are not limited by the Existing Credit Agreement and the 2017 Notes Indenture.\nAlthough we historically have had a working capital deficit, we anticipate that, after giving effect to the 2019 Recapitalization, in future periods the reduction in cash interest payments compared to those under our prior financing arrangements will favorably impact our operating cash flows and offset the working capital deficit that will continue for the foreseeable future.\nCash Flows - Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nAt December 31, 2018, we had $99.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash on hand, an increase of $34.5 million from $64.6 million at December 31, 2017. The following table summarizes our cash flows and compares changes in our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash on hand to the same period in the prior year.\n\nOperating Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated $15.4 million more cash from operating activities than during the year ended December 31, 2017. A net $29.6 million decrease in receivables, driven primarily by the loss of a key loyalty client in the fourth quarter of 2017 and a net $12.3 million increase in accounts payable, driven primarily by larger commissions payable in the insurance solutions business prior to the ABG Sale were partially offset by a net $15.4 million increase in other current assets, driven primarily by larger prepaid credit card charges from growth with new global loyalty clients and an $8.7 million increase in cash interest payments.\nInvesting Activities\nWe generated $479.5 million of cash from investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to a use of $38.5 million of cash during the year ended December 31, 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2018, proceeds from the ABG Sale, net of cash transferred was $517.3 million, which was partially offset by $32.1 million for capital expenditures and $5.7 million of acquisition-related payments, net of cash acquired. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we used $38.1 million for capital expenditures and made acquisition-related payments, net of cash acquired, of $0.4 million.\nFinancing Activities\nWe used $463.3 million of cash from financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $30.4 million of cash generated from financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we made term loan payments of $507.1 million, including $14.4 million in repayment premiums and we had net borrowings under our revolving credit facility of $45.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we made payments on our first-lien and second-lien term loans of $753.8 million and $425.0 million, respectively, redeemed the International senior subordinated notes for $118.5 million, redeemed Affinion's 2010 senior notes, Affinion Holdings' 2013 senior notes and the Investments 2013 senior subordinated notes for $227.4 million and made payments on our term loan under the Existing Credit Agreement of $10.0 million. We also issued 2017 Notes for $235.9 million, received $1,303.7 million and $55.0 million of term loans and revolving credit facility under the Existing Credit Agreement and incurred $29.3 million of financing costs related to the 2017 Notes and Existing Credit Agreement.\nCash Flows - Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nAt December 31, 2017, we had $64.6 million of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash on hand, an increase of $0.8 million from $63.8 million at December 31, 2016. The following table summarizes our cash flows and compares changes in our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash on hand to the same period in the prior year.\n\nOperating Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated $20.1 million less cash from operating activities than during the year ended December 31, 2016. Segment EBITDA decreased $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition, the Company paid $23.2 million in connection with the cyber theft that occurred in the first quarter of 2017.\nInvesting Activities\nWe used $4.2 million more cash in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we used $38.1 million for capital expenditures as compared to $34.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nFinancing Activities\nWe generated $38.7 million more cash from financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we made payments on our first-lien and second-lien term loans of $753.8 million and $425.0 million, respectively, redeemed the International Notes for $118.5 million, redeemed Affinion's 2010 senior notes, Affinion Holdings' 2013 senior notes and the Investments senior subordinated notes for $227.4 million and made payments on our term loan under the Existing Credit Agreement of $10.0 million. We also issued 2017 Notes for $235.9 million, received $1,303.7 million and $55.0 million of term loans and revolving credit facility under the Existing Credit Agreement and incurred $29.3 million of financing costs related to the 2017 Notes and Existing Credit Agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we made payments on our first-lien term loan of $7.8 million.\nCredit Facilities and Long-Term Debt following the 2019 Recapitalization\nGeneral\nFollowing the 2019 Recapitalization, we will remain a highly leveraged company. As of December 31, 2018, after giving effect to the 2019 Recapitalization, we would have had approximately $1.1 billion in indebtedness on a consolidated basis, consisting of (1) $719.1 million outstanding term loans under Affinion's Amended Credit Agreement, as defined below, (2) $357.0 million principal outstanding under Affinion's New Notes and (3) $10.7 million principal amount outstanding under Affinion's 2017 Notes, as defined below and there would have been no amount outstanding under Affinion's revolving credit facility. In addition, Affinion would have had $80.0 million available under the revolving credit facility, after giving effect to the issuance of $5.0 million of letters of credit. See -Contractual Obligations and Commitments\u201d for a summary of our aggregate contractual obligations at December 31, 2018, giving effect to the 2019 Recapitalization, as if the Recapitalization had closed on December 31, 2018 and the estimated timing and effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods.\nAs of December 31, 2018, Affinion was in compliance with the restrictive covenants under Affinion's debt agreements.\nThe Amended Credit Agreement\nAffinion Holdings, Affinion, as the borrower, the lenders from time to time party thereto (the Lenders\u201d), certain subsidiaries of Affinion and HPS Investment Partners, LLC, as the administrative agent and collateral agent, are parties to that certain Credit Agreement, dated as of May 10, 2017 (as amended and/or amended and restated by that First Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated as of November 30, 2017, that Second Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated as of May 4, 2018, that Third Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated as of July 16, 2018 and that Fourth Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated as of November 14, 2018, the Existing Credit Agreement\u201d), pursuant to which the Lenders have made certain loans and provided certain commitments (subject to the terms and conditions thereof) to Affinion.\nIn connection with the consummation of the 2019 Recapitalization on April 10, 2019 (the Closing Date\u201d), Affinion entered into certain amendments to the Existing Credit Agreement (as amended, the Amended Credit Agreement\u201d) to (i) obtain an extension of the maturity of the Revolving Facility Commitments (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) and Term Loans (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) existing immediately prior to the consummation of the 2019 Recapitalization and (ii) modify certain other provisions in the Existing Credit Agreement. The Revolving Facility Lenders (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) and the Consenting Lenders agreed to extend the maturity of all Revolving Facility Loans (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) and such Consenting Lender's outstanding Term Loans (so extended, the 2019 Term Loans\u201d), as applicable, and consent to the proposed modifications with respect thereto in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Fifth Amendment to the Existing Credit Agreement (the Fifth Amendment\u201d); upon the consummation of the 2019 Recapitalization, Term Loans held by Term Lenders (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) that did not agree to extend their Term Loans into 2019 Term Loans were deemed a separate tranche from the 2019 Term Loans (such Term Loans to be referred to as the Non-Extended Term Loans\u201d), and the Revolving Facility Commitments were reduced to $85.0 million.\nThe material terms of the Amended Credit Agreement are the following:\nThe Amended Credit Agreement provides for quarterly amortization payments of the 2019 Term Loans totaling (i) for the first 3 years following the Fifth Amendment Effective Date, 0% per annum, (ii) for the fourth year following the Fifth Amendment Effective Date, 1.0% per annum and (iii) for each year thereafter 2.5% per annum, in each case, payable quarterly, with the balance payable upon the final maturity date. The 2019 Term Loans mature on April 10, 2024. The Revolving Facility Commitments under the Amended Credit Agreement mature on April 10, 2023. The Non-Extended Term Loans continue to be subject to an amortization schedule consistent with that set forth in the Existing Credit Agreement.\nIn addition, the Amended Credit Agreement requires Affinion to prepay outstanding term loans with:\n \u2022 100% of the net cash proceeds of asset sales and dispositions in excess of an amount per transaction and in the aggregate per fiscal year, subject, to the ability to reinvest a portion of such net cash proceeds; \n \u2022 100% of the net cash proceeds from any insurance or condemnation event, subject to the ability to reinvest a portion of such net cash proceeds; \n \u2022 100% of the net cash proceeds from extraordinary and non-recurring cash receipts in excess of an amount per receipt; \n \u2022 50% of Affinion's excess cash flow beginning with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019; and \n \u2022 100% of the net cash proceeds received from issuances of debt, subject to certain exclusions including certain debt permitted to be incurred under the Amended Credit Agreement. \nThe terms of the Amended Credit Agreement allows Affinion to permanently reduce the revolving loan commitments at any time without premium or penalty, subject to the payment of customary LIBOR breakage costs, if any, and provided that the commitments may not be reduced below the aggregate outstanding amount of revolving loans and letters of credit. In addition, Affinion will be able to terminate the Amended Credit Agreement upon prior written notice, and, in some cases, be able to revoke such notice. Upon termination, Affinion will be required to repay all obligations outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement and to satisfy all outstanding letter of credit obligations. Voluntary prepayments of 2019 Term Loans will be subject to (i) a make-whole premium for prepayments on or prior to the second anniversary of the Closing Date, and (ii) a prepayment premium of 103% of the principal amount prepaid after the second anniversary but on or prior to the third anniversary of the Closing Date. Voluntary prepayments of the Non-Extended Term Loans will continue to be subject to the premiums set forth in the Existing Credit Agreement.\nThe interest rates are based on, at Affinion's option, with respect to (A) 2019 Term Loans, (x) the higher of (i) adjusted LIBOR and (ii) 1.00%, in each case plus 5.75% (of which, from the Closing Date through the third anniversary thereof, 1.75% may be paid in kind, thereafter through the fourth anniversary thereof, 1.25% may be paid in kind, and thereafter, 0.75% may be paid in kind), or (y) the highest of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.5% and (iii) 2.00% ( ABR\u201d), in each case plus 4.75% (of which, from the Closing Date through the third anniversary thereof, 1.75% may be paid in kind, thereafter through the fourth anniversary thereof, 1.25% may be paid in kind, and thereafter, 0.75% may be paid in kind), and (B) revolving loans under the Amended Credit Agreement (x) the higher of (i) adjusted LIBOR and (ii) 1.00%, in each case plus 4.00%, or (y) the highest of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.5% and (iii) 2.00%, in each case plus 3.00%. The interest rates for the Non-Extended Term Loans will continue to be the same as those set forth in the Existing Credit Agreement.\nAdditionally, if any amount payable under the Amended Credit Agreement is not paid when due, (i) all overdue amounts owing under the Amended Credit Agreement will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the rate otherwise applicable thereto plus an additional 2.0% or at the ABR plus the applicable margin plus an additional 2.0% if no rate is otherwise applicable thereto and (ii) all other principal amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the rate otherwise applicable thereto plus an additional 2.0%.\nAffinion has the option of requesting that loans be made as LIBOR loans, converting any part of outstanding ABR loans (other than swingline loans) to LIBOR loans and converting any outstanding LIBOR loan to an ABR loan, subject to the payment of LIBOR breakage costs. With respect to LIBOR loans, interest will be payable in arrears at the end of each applicable interest period, but in any event at least every three (3) months. With respect to ABR loans, interest will be payable on the last business day of each fiscal quarter. In each case, calculations of interest are based on a 360-day year (or 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, in the case of loans based on the administrative agent's prime ABR rate, and loans in any jurisdiction where the relevant interbank market practice is to use a 365 or 366 day year) and actual days elapsed.\nAffinion's obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement continue to be guaranteed by Affinion Holdings and by each of Affinion's existing and subsequently acquired or organized domestic subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions, and certain existing and subsequently acquired foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions.\nThe Amended Credit Agreement continues to be secured to the extent legally permissible by substantially all the assets of (i) Affinion Holdings, which continue to consist of a perfected first-priority pledge of all of Affinion's capital stock and (ii) Affinion and the subsidiary guarantors, including but not limited to: (a) a first-priority pledge of substantially all capital stock held by Affinion or any subsidiary guarantor (which pledge, with respect to stock of certain foreign subsidiaries, may be limited to 100% of the non-voting stock (if any) of such foreign subsidiaries and 65% of the voting stock of such foreign subsidiaries) and (b) perfected first-priority security interests in substantially all tangible and intangible assets of Affinion and each subsidiary guarantor, subject to certain exceptions.\nThe Amended Credit Agreement contains financial, affirmative and negative covenants that we believe are usual and customary for a senior secured credit agreement. The negative covenants in the Amended Credit Agreement include, among other things, limitations (all of which are subject to certain exceptions) on Affinion's and its restricted subsidiaries' (and in certain cases, Affinion Holdings') ability to:\n \u2022 declare dividends and make other distributions; \n \u2022 redeem or repurchase Affinion's or such restricted subsidiary's capital stock; \n \u2022 prepay, redeem or repurchase certain of Affinion's or such restricted subsidiary's junior indebtedness; \n \u2022 make loans or investments (including acquisitions); \n \u2022 incur additional indebtedness; \n \u2022 grant liens; \n \u2022 enter into sale-leaseback transactions; \n \u2022 modify the terms of subordinated debt (and certain senior unsecured debt); \n \u2022 enter into agreements that would restrict the ability of Affinion's subsidiaries to pay dividends; \n \u2022 change Affinion's or such restricted subsidiary's business or the business of its subsidiaries; \n \u2022 merge or enter into acquisitions; \n \u2022 sell Affinion's or such restricted subsidiary's assets; and \n \u2022 enter into transactions with Affinion's affiliates. \nIn addition, the Amended Credit Agreement requires Affinion to comply with a maximum Senior Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) beginning with the fiscal quarter ending on September 30, 2020.\nThe events of default under the Amended Credit Agreement include, among others, nonpayment, material misrepresentations, breach of covenants, insolvency, bankruptcy, certain judgments, change of control (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) and cross-events of defaults and acceleration on material indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of default and the acceleration of the outstanding term loans under the Amended Credit Agreement (including, without limitation, by way of automatic acceleration), the applicable prepayment premium that would have been due if the term loans were optionally prepaid at such time shall also become due and payable.\nThe New Notes\nOn April 10, 2019, Affinion issued $357.0 million aggregate principal amount of New Notes under a new indenture (the New Notes Indenture\u201d) by and among Affinion, the guarantors party thereto and GLAS Trust Company LLC, as trustee.\nThe New Notes are unsecured senior obligations of Affinion, as issuer, and each of Affinion Holdings' and Affinion's restricted subsidiaries that guarantee the Amended Credit Agreement (collectively, the Guarantors\u201d), as guarantors; provided that the obligations of any Guarantor that is organized in any jurisdiction other than the United States or the United Kingdom with respect to its guarantee is subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full in cash of all obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement (as amended, restated, amended and restated, supplemented, refinanced, replaced or otherwise modified). The New Notes will mature on October 10, 2024, at their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the maturity date.\nInterest on the New Notes accrues at a rate per annum of 18.00%. Interest on the New Notes will be payable semi-annually in arrears on April 10 and October 10, commencing on October 10, 2019. Affinion will make each interest payment to the holders of record of the New Notes on the March 26 or September 25 record date immediately preceding the related interest payment date. The New Notes will accrue interest from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from and including October 10, 2024, and will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. Interest will be payable on the New Notes by increasing the principal amount of each holder's New Notes in the register by an amount equal to the amount of interest for the applicable interest period (rounded up to the nearest whole dollar) for such holder's New Notes (the PIK Payment\u201d). Following an increase in the principal amount of New Notes as a result of a PIK Payment, such New Notes will bear interest on such increased principal amount from and after the interest payment date in respect of which such PIK Payment was made.\nAffinion may redeem the New Notes, at its option, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days' prior notice sent electronically or mailed by first-class mail to each holder's registered address, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the New Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, to the redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).\nSubject to the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement, at any time, upon a Change of Control (as defined in the New Indenture), holders have the right to require Affinion to make an offer to purchase the holders' New Notes, in each case at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the New Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, to the redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).\nThe New Indenture contains certain covenants that limit Affinion's ability and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries to, among other things, (i) incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, or issue disqualified stock or preferred stock; (ii) pay dividends or make distributions; (iii) repurchase or redeem capital stock of Affinion or any parent of Affinion or subordinated indebtedness of Affinion or any restricted subsidiary of Affinion; (iv) make investments or acquisitions; (v) incur restrictions on the ability of certain of Affinion's subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments to Affinion; (vi) enter into transactions with affiliates; (vii) create liens; (viii) merge or consolidate with other companies or transfer all or substantially all of Affinion's assets; and (ix) prepay, redeem or repurchase debt that is junior in right of payment to the New Notes. In addition, the covenants restrict Affinion Holdings' ability to engage in certain businesses or business activities. Affinion is also required to deliver financial statements of Affinion and its restricted subsidiaries.\nThe New Indenture also provides that if the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio of Affinion on the maturity date of the New Notes is greater than or equal to 8.50 to 1.00, then, in lieu of Affinion making any required principal payment on the New Notes on such maturity date, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the New Notes outstanding may, with the consent of the Company elect to convert the then outstanding principal amount of the New Notes into New Common Stock, equal to a percentage of the fully diluted equity of the Company (calculated prior to dilution from the issuance of any New Common Stock, or securities convertible into New Common Stock, in each case issued under the New MIP), calculated by multiplying (A) 99.9999 by (B) (1) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of New Notes and any additional New Notes issued under the indenture (calculated after giving effect to any PIK Payments) as of such date divided by (2) the aggregate principal amount of New Notes and any additional New Notes issued under the indenture (including 18% PIK interest paid semi-annually on such New Notes and additional New Notes from the date of issuance thereof to the maturity date).\nAs of December 31, 2018, after giving effect to the 2019 Recapitalization, the New Notes would have ranked effectively junior to approximately $719.1 million of Affinion's secured indebtedness, all of which would have consisted of borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA consists of income from operations before depreciation and amortization further adjusted to exclude non-cash and unusual items and other adjustments permitted in Affinion's debt agreements to test the permissibility of certain types of transactions, including debt incurrence. We use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our operating performance and as a basis for determining payment of bonuses under our annual incentive plan. We present Adjusted EBITDA to enhance your understanding of our operating performance. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is an operating performance measure, and not a liquidity measure, that provides investors and analysts with a measure of operating results unaffected by differences in capital structures, capital investment cycles and ages of related assets among otherwise comparable companies. However, Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under U.S. GAAP and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. You should not consider Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative to operating or net income determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of cash flows, or as a measure of liquidity.\nSet forth below is a reconciliation of our consolidated net income attributable to Affinion Holdings for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 to Adjusted EBITDA.\n\n (a) Represents the elimination of the effect of business optimization expenses and restructuring charges or expenses. \n (b) Represents the elimination of extraordinary or nonrecurring or unusual losses, expenses or charges. \n (c) Primarily represents the elimination of (i) net changes in certain reserves, (ii) share-based compensation expense and (iii) foreign currency gains and losses related to unusual, non-recurring intercompany transactions. \n (d) Adjusted EBITDA, excluding pro forma adjustments, does not give pro forma effect to the projected annualized benefits of restructurings and other cost savings initiatives. However, we do make such accretive pro forma adjustments as if such restructurings and cost savings initiatives had occurred on January 1, 2018 in calculating the Adjusted EBITDA under the Existing Credit Agreement, subject to certain limitations. \n (e) Gives effect to the projected annualized benefits of restructurings and other cost savings initiatives as if such restructurings and cost savings initiatives had occurred on January 1, 2018. \n (f) Adjusted EBITDA, including pro forma adjustments, gives pro forma effect to the adjustments discussed in (e) above. \nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our aggregate contractual obligations at December 31, 2018, and the estimated timing and effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods. We expect to fund the contractual obligations and commitments with operating cash flow generated in the normal course of business and availability under our revolving credit facility.\n\n (1) Revolving credit facility expires May 10, 2022. \n (2) Long-term debt is reflected at face amount. \n (3) Interest on variable rate debt is based on December 31, 2018 interest rates and PIK interest is paid at maturity. \n (4) Represents commitments under purchase agreements for marketing and membership program support services. \n (5) Represents salary and target bonus amounts attributable to those employment agreements described under Item 11. Executive Compensation.\u201d Amounts are based on the assumption that no agreements are renewed beyond their initial terms and all performance metrics for bonus payouts are achieved. Amounts exclude severance and other payouts due upon hypothetical termination of employment. \n (6) Includes capital lease obligations and liabilities for foreign uncertain tax positions. \nThe following table summarizes our aggregate contractual obligations at December 31, 2018, giving effect to the 2019 Recapitalization, as if the Recapitalization had closed on December 31, 2018 and the estimated timing and effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods. We expect to fund the contractual obligations and commitments with operating cash flow generated in the normal course of business and availability under our Revolving Facility Commitments (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement).\n\n (1) Long-term debt is reflected at face amount. \n (2) Revolving credit facility expires April 10, 2023. \n (3) Interest on variable rate debt is based on December 31, 2018 interest rates and PIK interest is paid at maturity. \n (4) Represents commitments under purchase agreements for marketing and membership program support services. \n (5) Represents salary and target bonus amounts attributable to those employment agreements described under Item 11. Executive Compensation.\u201d Amounts are based on the assumption that no agreements are renewed beyond their initial terms and all performance metrics for bonus payouts are achieved. Amounts exclude severance and other payouts due upon hypothetical termination of employment. \n (6) Includes capital lease obligations and liabilities for foreign uncertain tax positions. \nThe above tables do not give effect to contingent obligations, such as litigation claims, standard guarantees and indemnities, contingent consideration related to acquisitions, surety bonds and letters of credit, due to the fact that at this time we cannot determine either the amount or timing of payments related to these contingent obligations. See Note 14-Commitments and Contingencies in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein for a discussion of these contingent obligations. The above tables also do not include obligations in connection with our liabilities for uncertain tax positions as we have significant federal and state net operating loss carryforwards that we believe will be available to offset any liabilities for uncertain tax positions incurred. In addition, we refer you to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nDebt Repurchases\nWe or our affiliates have, in the past, and may, from time to time in the future, purchase any of our or Affinion's indebtedness. Any such future purchases may be made through open market or privately negotiated transactions with third parties or pursuant to one or more tender or exchange offers or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as we or any such affiliates may determine.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have not been disclosed in -Contractual Obligations and Commitments.\u201d\nCritical Accounting Policies\nIn presenting our audited consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported therein. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies related to revenue recognition, accounting for marketing costs, share-based compensation, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets and valuation of tax assets and liabilities could potentially affect our reported results and as such, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Several of the estimates and assumptions we are required to make relate to matters that are inherently uncertain, as they pertain to future events. However, certain events outside our control cannot be predicted and, as such, they cannot be contemplated in evaluating such estimates and assumptions. We believe that the estimates and assumptions used when preparing our audited consolidated financial statements were the most appropriate at the time. Significant estimates include accounting for income tax valuation allowances, litigation accruals, the fair values of reporting units, share-based compensation, assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations and financial instruments. For a summary of all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein.\nRevenue Recognition\nEffective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASC 606\u201d). The adoption of ASC 606 affected the Company's Global Loyalty, Global Customer Engagement and Legacy Membership and Package segments. Within the Global Loyalty segment, the Company has contracts with certain clients that have annual revenue-sharing and tiered pricing components (variable consideration arrangements) based on transaction volumes. Under prior guidance, revenue was recognized as the Company achieved those contractual tiers. Under ASC 606, revenue derived from these revenue-sharing and tiered pricing contracts is recognized based upon an estimate of the Company's ability to achieve those contractual tiers during each annual measurement period. Based on the Company's estimates of reaching different contractual tiers, a portion of the estimated annual revenue is deferred to a future period within the annual measurement period as these contract features provide a material right to the Company's clients. Within the Company's Global Customer Engagement segment, payments made by our customers for the provision of services were amortized over the length of the contract under prior guidance. Under ASC 606, the Company has reduced its amortization period to include only the non-cancellable period of the contract, though where the cancellation of a contract would be cost prohibitive to the customer, the Company may amortize its revenue beyond the non-cancellable period. Lastly, within the Legacy Membership and Package segment, certain members are entitled to a full membership refund throughout their entire membership term, regardless of when they cancel. Under ASC 606, revenue is recognized over time in a manner that reflects the timing of transfer of goods and services to these customers.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nIn connection with the Apollo Transactions, the Company recorded goodwill of approximately $315.3 million and intangible assets of $1,430.0 million. In subsequent years, the Company has consummated several acquisitions resulting in the recognition of additional goodwill, as well as intangible assets.\nUnder current accounting guidance, there is a requirement to assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. We assess goodwill for such impairment by comparing the carrying value of the reporting units to their fair values. Fair values of the reporting units are determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows and incorporate assumptions that we believe marketplace participants would utilize.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test for those reporting units that had goodwill recorded. Key assumptions used in the goodwill impairment test were a long-term growth rate of 2.0% growth and discount rates ranging from 10.0% to 11.0%. In 2018, the fair value of each reporting unit that has goodwill exceeded its respective carrying amount by more than 25%.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment and written down to fair value, as required by current accounting guidance. We perform reviews annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred. There were no impairments identified during each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. As of December 31, 2018, intangible assets consist of assets with finite useful lives initially recorded at their respective fair values.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are presented in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein using the asset and liability approach. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated based upon the temporary differences between the financial statements and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates. Deferred tax assets are recorded net of a valuation allowance when, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods. Decreases to the valuation allowance are recorded as reductions to the income tax provision, while increases to the valuation allowance result in additional income tax provision. The realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on estimated future taxable income. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company has recorded a full valuation allowance for its U.S. federal net deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company has also recorded valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets of certain state and foreign taxing jurisdictions.\nThe tax effects of an uncertain tax position ( UTP\u201d) taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns are recognized only if it is more likely-than-not\u201d to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on its technical merits as of the reporting date. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company recognizes changes in estimated accrued interest and penalties related to UTPs as an increase or decrease to the income tax provision, as applicable.\nThe Company recognizes the benefit of a UTP in the period when it is effectively settled. Previously recognized tax positions are derecognized in the first period in which it is no longer more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained upon examination.\nOn December 22, 2017, the TCJA was enacted into law. The TCJA significantly revises the U.S. corporate income tax laws by, among other things, lowering the corporate income tax rate to 21%, implementing a modified territorial tax system and imposing a one-time repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings and profits of U.S.-owned foreign subsidiaries (the transition tax\u201d). The U.S. federal income tax rate reduction was effective as of January 1, 2018. The Company has elected to account for GILTI (global intangible low-taxed income), as a period cost if and when incurred. The Company recorded provisional amounts related to the TCJA for the remeasurement of deferred taxes and the transition tax for the year ended December 31, 2017. During 2018 and prior to December 22, 2018, the Company finalized and completed its accounting associated with the TCJA, and no subsequent adjustments to provisional amounts were recorded.\nCautionary Statements for Forward-Looking Information\nThis Report contains forward-looking statements\u201d that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements include statements concerning our plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events, future revenues or performance, capital expenditures, financing needs and other information that is not historical information and, in particular, appear under headings Item 1A.

and Analysis (MD&A) of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for Affinion Group Holdings, Inc. The MD&A is separated into several key areas and aims to provide an understanding of the company\u2019s financial status and operations. Key sections include:\n\n- Overview: Discusses the company\u2019s business, operating segments, and recent developments that are significant for understanding the results of operations and financial condition.\n- Results of Operations: Analyzes financial results on a consolidated and operating segment basis, comparing the years ended December 31, 2018, to 2017 and December 31, 2017, to 2016.\n- Financial Condition, Liquidity, and Capital Resources: Analyzes cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2018, and 2017, and discusses liquidity and capital resources.\n- Critical Accounting Policies: Discusses significant accounting policies that require significant judgment and estimates from management, such as revenue recognition, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, and tax assets and liabilities.\n\nKey points from the report include:\n\n- Affinion Holdings develops loyalty programs and customer engagement solutions that help businesses retain and reward customers.\n- The company sold its domestic insurance business in August 2018, marking a strategic shift towards being a pure-play loyalty solutions company.\n- Affinion's financial business model is characterized by substantial recurring revenues, mainly derived from service fees, commissions/transaction fees, and subscriptions.\n- The company implemented a global reorganization to drive best practices and efficiencies with cost savings, ceased investments in businesses not essential to long-term growth, and aims to maintain its position as a global leader in loyalty and customer engagement solutions.\n- Affinion operates in competitive environments with risks including changes in financial industry trends and regulatory environments, which could impact marketing practices and services provided to customers.\n- Seasonality has traditionally not impacted revenue significantly, however, recent trends in loyalty business cash flows show seasonality due to consumer behavior, particularly with gift card redemptions.\n- The company has a history dating back over 40 years, with various acquisitions and financial transactions shaping its current form.\n- Various debt refinancing and restructuring efforts, including the 2015 Exchange Offers and the 2017 Exchange Offers, have substantially limited the company's ability to use pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes due to ownership changes pursuant to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.\n- For the year ended December 31, 2018, there was a decrease in net revenues and segment EBITDA, primarily due to lower retail revenue in the Legacy Membership and Package segment, with a significant part of EBITDA being driven by their Global Loyalty segment.\n- An assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment is performed annually and income taxes are presented using the asset and liability approach.\n- The MD&A contains forward-looking statements that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.\n\nOverall, the MD&A provides detailed insights into Affinion's operations, financial position, strategies, and future expectations, along with various risks and uncertainties that could affect future results."}
