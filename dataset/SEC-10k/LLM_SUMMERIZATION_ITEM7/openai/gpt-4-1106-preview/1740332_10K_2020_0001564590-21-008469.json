We are a leader in the home heating, ventilation and air conditioning controls and security markets. We have a global footprint serving commercial and residential end-markets. We manage our business operations through two segments, Products & Solutions and ADI Global Distribution. Our Products & Solutions segment consists of comfort, security, residential thermal ( RTS\u201d) products and solutions. Our offerings include temperature and humidity control, thermal and combustion solutions, water and air solutions, as well as security panels, sensors, peripherals, wire and cable, communications devices, video cameras, awareness solutions, cloud infrastructure, installation and maintenance tools and related software. Our ADI Global Distribution business is the leading wholesale distributor of low-voltage security products including intrusion, access control and video products and participates significantly in the broader related markets of smart home, fire, power, audio, ProAV, networking, communications, wire and cable, enterprise connectivity, and structured wiring products. The Products & Solutions segment, consistent with our industry, has a higher gross and operating profit margin profile in comparison to the ADI Global Distribution segment.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, we made a change to our reportable segments. Previously we allocated corporate costs to the Products & Solutions segment as well as the ADI Global Distribution segment. We now report corporate costs separately, as Corporate, from the two operating segments. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2020, our Chief Operating Decision Maker moved towards making financial decisions and allocating resources based on Operating profit, rather than Segment Adjusted EBITDA. These changes were designed to better align accountability and authority, give a clearer view into the operational performance of the two segments and increase accountability for management of corporate spending.\nOur financial performance is influenced by several macro factors such as repair and remodeling activity, residential and non-residential construction, employment rates, and overall macro environment. The global outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease ( COVID-19\u201d) created economic disruption. Starting at the end of the first quarter and throughout the second quarter, we experienced constrained supply and slowed customer demand, as well as temporary closures of several of our ADI Global Distribution branches, that adversely impacted business, results of operations, and overall financial performance. Although there remains uncertainty as to the continuing implications of COVID-19, during the second half of the year customer demand improved and ongoing cost actions and transformation efforts contributed to the improvements in the Company's operations and overall financial performance.\nDuring 2020, the Products & Solutions segment revenue declined 2% compared to 2019, driven by softness in Comfort and RTS product lines offset by strength in the Security business. Operating profit was positively impacted by cost savings from transformation programs, sourcing productivity, lower charges related to obsolete and surplus inventory, and other cost reduction efforts, offset by lower revenue volumes, unfavorable sales mix, investments to support new product launches, and labor and material inflation.\nOur ADI Global Distribution business revenue increased 5% compared to 2019. Throughout 2020, the business continued its strong performance, achieving solid growth in US, including the impact from the 2020 Herman ProAV acquisition, as well as EMEA, and expansion in top product lines. ADI Global Distribution accelerated the adoption of digital tools, which is reflected in strong e-commerce growth. Operating profit was negatively impacted by unfavorable sales mix, commercial investments, acquisition related costs, and other cost inflation of $34 million, partially offset by transformation program cost savings, other expense productivity and cost reduction programs totaling $18 million.\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nCurrent Period Highlights\nNet revenues increased $83 million in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to increased pricing on certain products and acquisitions, partially offset by volume. Gross profit as a percent of net revenues was consistent at 26%. The primary drivers to the flat gross profit percentage were a 100 basis point ( bps\u201d) negative impact from unfavorable sales mix changes offset by 100 bps positive impact from transformation program cost savings. Net income for 2020 was $37 million compared to $36 million for 2019.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $17 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease was driven by transformation program cost savings, decrease in Spin-Off related expenses, and other cost reductions totaling $150 million. These decreases were partially offset by transformation program expenses and related restructuring expenses, labor and other cost inflation, commercial investments, investments to support new product launches, the expense impact of acquisitions, and labor and other expense inflation totaling $133 million.\nWe ended 2020 with $517 million in cash and cash equivalents. Net cash provided by operating activities was $244 million for the year. At December 31, 2020, accounts receivable were $863 million and inventories were $672 million.\nRecent Developments\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nThe World Health Organization ( WHO\u201d) declared COVID-19 a pandemic in March 2020. The broader implications of COVID-19 on our results of operations and overall financial performance remain uncertain. Starting at the end of the first quarter of 2020 and throughout the second quarter, we experienced constrained supply and slowed customer demand, as well as temporary closures of several of our ADI Global Distribution branches, that adversely impacted business, results of operations and overall financial performance. During the second half of 2020 customer demand improved and on-going cost actions and transformation efforts contributed to improvements in the Company's results of operations and overall financial performance. As there remains uncertainty around the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company addresses and evaluates the impacts frequently. See Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Form 10-K for further discussion of the possible impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.\nU.S. and international government responses to the COVID-19 outbreak have included shelter in place,\u201d stay at home\u201d and similar types of orders. These orders exempt certain products and services needed to maintain continuity of operations of critical infrastructure sectors as determined by the U.S. federal government and certain other countries globally. Although certain of the Company's operations are currently considered essential and exempt in the United States, Canada and certain other countries globally, there remain certain jurisdictions where there have been and may continue to be restrictions on manufacturing or operations or other government lockdown mandates or recommendations, under which we have temporarily closed certain manufacturing and sales facilities, and restricted operations in others, including manufacturing in Mexico and restricted operations in certain ADI sales branches, although these facilities have since reopened or remained opened with restricted sales activities. If any of the applicable exemptions are curtailed or revoked in the future, that could adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition. Furthermore, to the extent these exemptions do not extend to our key suppliers and customers, this could also adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition. We have also implemented work-from-home policies for a significant percentage of our employees, which could negatively impact productivity, disrupt conduct of our business in the ordinary course and delay our production timelines. Due to the significant remote workforce populations, we may also face informational technology infrastructure and connectivity issues from the vendors that we rely on for certain information technologies to administer, store and support the Company's multiple business activities. Finally, we are incurring increased costs associated with cleaning and other employee safety measures.\nOur visibility toward future performance is more limited than is typical due to the uncertainty surrounding the duration and ultimate impact of COVID-19 and the mitigation measures that are implemented by governmental authorities. We also expect business conditions to remain challenging. In response to these challenges, we will continue to focus on those factors that we can control: closely managing and controlling our expenses;\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\naligning our production schedules with demand in a proactive manner as there are changes in market conditions to minimize our cash operating costs; and pursuing further improvements in the productivity and effectiveness of our manufacturing, selling and administrative activities.\n2020 Public Offering of Common Stock\nOn November 17, 2020, we entered into an underwriting agreement (the Underwriting Agreement\u201d) which provided for the offer and sale of 17,000,000 shares of common stock at the public offering price of $15.00 per share (the Offering\u201d). The Offering closed on November 20, 2020. On December 14, 2020 the closing of the exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase an additional 2,550,000 shares of common stock of the Offering price of $15.00 per share as allowed in the Underwriting Agreement. Net proceeds received were approximately $279 million.\nAmended and Restated Credit Facilities\nOn February 12, 2021, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the A&R Credit Agreement\u201d). The A&R Credit Agreement provides for (i) a seven-year senior secured term B loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $950 million (the A&R Term B Facility\u201d) and (ii) a five-year senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million (the A&R Revolving Credit Facility\u201d and, together with the Term Loan Facilities, the A&R Senior Credit Facilities\u201d).\nBasis of Presentation\nPrior to becoming an independent publicly traded company (the Spin-Off\u201d) on October 29, 2018, our historical financial statements were prepared on a stand-alone combined basis and were derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Honeywell International Inc. ( Honeywell\u201d). Accordingly, for periods prior to October 29, 2018, our financial statements are presented on a combined basis and for the periods subsequent to October 29, 2018 are presented on a consolidated basis (collectively, the historical financial statements for all periods presented are referred to as Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\u201d). The Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The historical combined financial information prior to the Spin-Off may not be indicative of our future performance and does not necessarily reflect what our consolidated and combined results of operations, financial condition and cash flows would have been had we operated as a separate, publicly traded company during the periods presented, particularly because of changes that we experienced as a result of our separation from Honeywell, including changes in the financing, cash management, operations, cost structure, and personnel needs of our Company.\nThe combined financial statements prior to the Spin-Off include certain assets and liabilities that were held at the Honeywell corporate level but were specifically identifiable or otherwise attributable to us. Additionally, Honeywell historically provided certain services, such as legal, accounting, information technology, human resources and other infrastructure support, on our behalf. The costs of these services were allocated to us on the basis of the proportion of net revenue. Actual costs that would have been incurred if we had been a stand-alone company for the entire period being presented would depend on multiple factors, including organizational structure and strategic decisions made in various areas, including information technology and infrastructure. Both we and Honeywell consider the basis on which the expenses were allocated during the period before the Spin-Off to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided to or the benefits received by us during the periods presented.\nSince the completion of the Spin-Off, we have incurred expenditures consisting of employee-related costs, costs to start up certain stand-alone functions and information technology systems and other one-time transaction related costs. Recurring stand-alone costs include establishing the internal audit, treasury, investor relations, tax and corporate secretary functions as well as the annual expenses associated with running an independent publicly traded company including listing fees, compensation of non-employee directors, related board of director fees and other fees and expenses related to insurance, legal and external audit.\nPrior to Spin-Off, our environmental expenses for specified Honeywell properties contaminated through historical business operations ( Honeywell Sites\u201d), now subject to the Reimbursement Agreement, were reported within other expense, net in our Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations, which reflect an estimated liability for resolution of pending and future environmental-related liabilities. Prior to the Spin-Off, this estimated\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nliability was calculated as if we were responsible for 100% of the environmental-liability payments associated with certain sites. See Environmental Matters and Reimbursement Agreement sections of Note 19. Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information.\nReclassification\nOn January 1, 2020, we changed our classification of research and development expenses from Cost of goods sold to Selling, general and administrative expenses, such that research and development expenses are excluded from the calculation of Gross profit. This change had no impact on Net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share or the Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated and Combined Statements of Cash Flow or Equity. The Company determined the impact on previously issued consolidated and combined annual and interim financial statements was not material. The impact for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, was a decrease in Cost of goods sold and an increase in Gross profit and in Selling, general and administrative expenses of $87 million and $59 million, respectively. The impact of the reclassification for the year ended December 31, 2019 is also reflected in Note 7. Restructuring Charges of Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.\nIn addition, the prior year segment information was recast to present Corporate separately as well as present Operating profit which replaces Segment Adjusted EBITDA. See Note 21. Segment Financial Data of Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period financial statements to conform to the classification adopted in the current period.\nComponents of Operating Results\nNet Revenue\nWe manage our global business operations through two reportable segments, Products & Solutions and ADI Global Distribution:\nProducts & Solutions: We generate the majority of our Products & Solutions net revenue primarily from residential end-markets. Our Products & Solutions segment includes traditional products, as well as connected products, which we define as any device with the capability to be monitored or controlled from a remote location by an end-user or service provider. Our products are sold through a network of HVAC, plumbing, security, and electrical distributors including our ADI Global Distribution business, OEMs, and service providers such as HVAC contractors, security dealers and plumbers. We also sell some products via retail and online channels.\nADI Global Distribution: We generate revenue through the distribution of low-voltage electronic and security products, as well as smart home, fire, power, audio and ProAV, networking, communications, wire and cable, enterprise connectivity, and structured wiring products that are delivered through a comprehensive network of professional contractors, distributors and OEMs, as well as major retailers and online merchants. In addition to our own security products, ADI Global Distribution distributes products from industry-leading manufacturers, and also carries a line of private label products. We sell these products to contractors that service non-residential and residential end-users. 14% of ADI Global Distribution's net revenue is supplied by our Products & Solutions Segment. Management estimates that in 2020 approximately two-thirds of ADI Global Distribution's net revenue was attributed to non-residential end markets and one-third to residential end markets.\nCost of Goods Sold\nProducts & Solutions: Cost of goods sold includes costs associated with raw materials, assembly, shipping and handling of those products, costs of personnel-related expenses, including pension benefits, and equipment associated with manufacturing support, logistics and quality assurance, non-research and development engineering costs, and costs of certain intangible assets.\nADI Global Distribution: Cost of goods sold consists primarily of inventory-related costs and includes labor and personnel-related expenses.\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nSelling, general and administrative expense includes trademark royalty expenses, sales incentives and commissions, professional fees, legal fees, promotional and advertising expenses, personnel-related expenses, including stock compensation expense and pension benefits, and research and development expenses. In addition, prior to the Spin-Off, our selling, general and administrative expense included an allocated portion of general corporate expenses.\nOther Expense, Net\nOther expense, net consists primarily of Reimbursement Agreement expenses (gains) for certain environmental claims related to approximately 230 sites or groups of sites that are undergoing environmental remediation under U.S. federal or state law and agency oversight for contamination associated with Honeywell historical business operations. Prior to the Spin-Off, other expense, net included the environmental expenses related to these same sites. For further information see Note 19. Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for discussion of environmental and the Reimbursement Agreement. Other expense, net also includes foreign exchange gains and losses.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists of interest on our short and long-term obligations, including our senior notes, term credit facility, and revolving credit facility. Interest expense on our obligations includes contractual interest, amortization of the debt discount and amortization of deferred financing costs.\nTax Expense (Benefit)\nProvision for income taxes includes both domestic and foreign income taxes at the applicable statutory tax rates adjusted for U.S. taxation of foreign earnings, non-deductible expenses and other permanent differences.\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\nThe following table sets forth our Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations for the periods presented:\nConsolidated and Combined Statements of Operations\n(In millions except share and per share data)\nTable 24: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,827\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,277\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,425\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income before taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (301\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted Average Number of Common Shares Outstanding (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Basic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 125,348\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 122,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 122,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 126,324\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 123,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 122,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Earnings Per Share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Basic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3.31\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3.30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Revenue\nTable 25: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,827\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % change compared with prior period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet revenue increased 2% in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to increase in pricing on certain products and acquisitions, partially offset by reduced volume.

This $47 million increase in cost of goods sold was primarily driven by impact of product expenses related to revenue that was attributable to the operations of the 2020 Herman ProAV acquisition, unfavorable changes in sales mix, and material and labor inflation totaling $137 million. The increased costs were partially offset by the favorable impact of sourcing productivity, transformation programs cost savings, lower charges related to obsolete and surplus inventory, lower spin-related costs, and other cost reductions totaling $90 million.\nThe primary drivers of flat gross profit percentage were a 100 bps negative impact from changes in sales mix, offset by 100 bps favorable impact of transformation programs cost savings.\n2019 compared with 2018\nCost of goods sold for 2019 was $3,711 million, an increase of $309 million, or 9%, from $3,402 million in 2018. This $309 million increase in cost of goods sold was primarily driven by higher revenue in the ADI Global Distribution segment, material and labor inflation and increased production costs including charges related to obsolete and surplus inventory, changes in sales mix, increased headquarter allocations in the period prior to the Spin-Off, expenses related to transformation programs and related restructuring costs, and Spin-Off related costs totaling $435 million. The increased costs were partially offset by sourcing productivity, foreign currency translation, lower environmental expense, and savings in other miscellaneous costs of goods sold totaling $126 million.\nThe primary drivers to the decrease in gross profit percentage were a 200 bps impact from changes in sales mix, 100 bps impact from material and labor inflation and fixed production costs, and 100 bps impact from headquarter allocations previously classified in selling, general and administrative expense in the period prior to the Spin-Off.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nTable 27: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2020 compared with 2019\nSelling, general and administrative expense for 2020 was $1,002 million, a decrease of $17 million, from $1,019 million in 2019. The decrease was driven by transformation programs cost savings, decrease in Spin-Off related expenses, and other cost reductions totaling $150 million. These decreases were partially offset by transformation program expenses and related restructuring costs, commercial investments, investments to support new product launches, and the expense impact of acquisitions totaling $133 million.\n2019 compared with 2018\nSelling, general and administrative expense for 2019 was $1,019 million, an increase of $87 million from $932 million in 2018. The increase was driven by greater Spin-Off related costs, increased research and development spend, increased royalty fees associated with the Trademark License Agreement, transformation program expenses and related restructuring costs, higher legal expenses, the expense impact of acquisitions, and labor and other expense inflation totaling $175 million.

The Credit Agreement provides for (i) a seven-year senior\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nsecured first-lien term B loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $475 million (the Term B Facility\u201d)\u037e (ii) a five-year senior secured first-lien term A loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $350 million (the Term A Facility\u201d and, together with the Term B Facility, the Term Loans or Term Loan Facilities\u201d)\u037e and (iii) a five-year senior secured first-lien revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $350 million (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d and, together with the Term Loan Facilities, the Senior Credit Facilities\u201d). As of December 31, 2020, there were no borrowings and no Letters of Credit outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nThe Senior Credit Facilities were subject to an interest rate and interest period which we will elect. As amended, the margin was 2.25% per annum (for LIBOR loans) and 1.25% per annum (for alternate base rate ABR\u201d loans) in respect of the Term B Loan Facility, and based on our leverage ratio, from 2.25% per annum to 1.75% per annum (for LIBOR loans) and 1.25% to 0.75% per annum (for ABR loans) for the Term A Loan Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility.\nThe Credit Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants customary for financings of this type that, among other things, limit our and our subsidiaries' ability to incur additional indebtedness or liens, to dispose of assets, to make certain fundamental changes, enter into restrictive agreements, to make certain investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions, to prepay certain indebtedness and to pay dividends, to make other distributions or redemptions/repurchases, in respect of our and our subsidiaries' equity interests, to engage in transactions with affiliates or amend certain material documents. In addition, the Credit Agreement also contains financial maintenance and coverage covenants. The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, including with respect to a failure to make payments under the Senior Credit Facilities, cross-default, certain bankruptcy and insolvency events and customary change of control events.\nAll obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities are or will be unconditionally guaranteed jointly and severally, by: (a) our Company and (b) substantially all of the direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of our Company that are organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia (collectively, the Guarantors\u201d). Subject to certain limitations, the Senior Credit Facilities are or will be secured on a first priority basis by: (x) a perfected security interest in the equity interests of each direct subsidiary of the Company and each Guarantor under the Senior Credit Facilities (subject to certain customary exceptions) and (y) perfected, security interests in, and mortgages on, substantially all tangible and intangible personal property and material real property of the Company and each of the Guarantors under the Senior Credit Facilities, subject, in each case, to certain exceptions.\nOn February 12, 2021, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the A&R Credit Agreement\u201d) which replaced the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and refinanced all amounts that were outstanding under these facilities.\nAmended and Restated Credit Agreement\nOn February 12, 2021, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the A&R Credit Agreement\u201d). The A&R Credit Agreement provides for (i) a seven-year senior secured term B loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $950 million (the A&R Term B Facility\u201d) and (ii) a five-year senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million (the A&R Revolving Credit Facility\u201d and, together with the Term Loan Facilities, the A&R Senior Credit Facilities\u201d).\nWe are obligated to make quarterly principal payments of approximately $2.4 million throughout the term of the A&R Term B Facility according to the amortization provisions in the A&R Credit Agreement. In addition to paying interest on outstanding borrowings under the A&R Revolving Credit Facility, we are required to pay a quarterly commitment fee based on the unused portion of the A&R Revolving Credit Facility. Borrowings under the A&R Credit Agreement can be prepaid at our option without premium or penalty other than a 1.00% prepayment premium that may be payable in connection with certain repricing transactions within a certain period of time after the closing date. Up to $75 million may be utilized under the A&R Revolving Credit Facility for the issuance of letters of credit to the Company or any of our subsidiaries. Letters of credit are available for issuance under the A&R Credit Agreement on terms and conditions customary for financings of this kind, which issuances will reduce the available funds under the A&R Revolving Credit Facility.\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nThe A&R Senior Credit Facilities are subject to an interest rate and interest period which we will elect. If we choose to make a base rate borrowing on an overnight basis, the interest rate will be based on the highest of (1) the rate of interest last quoted by The Wall Street Journal as the prime rate\u201d in the United States, (2) the greater of the federal funds effective rate and the overnight bank funding rate, plus 0.5% and (3) the one month adjusted LIBOR rate, plus 1.00% per annum. For the A&R Term Loan B, the applicable LIBOR rate will not be less than 0.50% per annum. The applicable margin for the A&R Term B Facility is 2.25% per annum (for LIBOR loans) and 1.25% per annum (for base rate loans). The applicable margin for the A&R Revolving Credit Facility varies from 2.25% per annum to 1.75% per annum (for LIBOR loans) and 1.25% to 0.75% per annum (for base rate loans) based on our leverage ratio. Accordingly, the interest rates for the A&R Senior Credit Facilities will fluctuate during the term of the A&R Credit Agreement based on changes in the base rate, LIBOR rate or future changes in our leverage ratio. Interest payments with respect to the borrowings are required either on a quarterly basis (for base rate loans) or at the end of each interest period (for LIBOR loans) or, if the duration of the applicable interest period exceeds three months, then every three months.\nThe A&R Credit Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants customary for financings of this type that, among other things, limit our and our subsidiaries' ability to incur additional indebtedness or liens, to dispose of assets, to make certain fundamental changes, enter into restrictive agreements, to make certain investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions, to prepay certain indebtedness and to pay dividends, to make other distributions or redemptions/repurchases, in respect of our and our subsidiaries' equity interests, to engage in transactions with affiliates or amend certain material documents. In addition, the A&R Revolving Credit Facility also contains certain financial maintenance covenants. The A&R Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, including with respect to a failure to make payments under the A&R Senior Credit Facilities, cross-default, certain bankruptcy and insolvency events and customary change of control events.\nAll obligations under the A&R Senior Credit Facilities are or will be unconditionally guaranteed jointly and severally, by: (a) our Company and (b) substantially all of the direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of our Company that are organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia (collectively, the Guarantors\u201d). The Guarantors entered into a guarantee under the A&R Credit Agreement concurrently with the effectiveness of the A&R Credit Agreement. Subject to certain limitations, the A&R Senior Credit Facilities are or will be secured on a first priority basis by: (x) a perfected security interest in the equity interests of each direct subsidiary of the Company and each Guarantor under the A&R Senior Credit Facilities (subject to certain customary exceptions) and (y) perfected, security interests in, and mortgages on, substantially all tangible and intangible personal property and material real property of the Company and each of the Guarantors under the A&R Senior Credit Facilities, subject, in each case, to certain exceptions. The Company and the Guarantors entered into security documents concurrently with effectiveness of the A&R Credit Agreement.\nSenior Notes\nIn October of 2018, we issued $400 million in principal amount of 6.125% senior unsecured notes due in 2026 (the Senior Notes\u201d). The Senior Notes guarantees are unsecured senior debt obligations of the Senior Notes guarantors. The net proceeds from the borrowings under the Senior Credit Facilities and the offering of the Senior Notes were used as part of financing the Spin-Off.\nInterest expense presented in the Statements of Operations is from the Senior Notes and Senior Credit Facilities, which includes the amortization of debt issuance cost and debt discounts.\nOn February 16, 2021 we redeemed $140 million in principal amount of the Senior Notes at a redemption price of 106.125% of par plus accrued interest.\nReimbursement Agreement\nIn connection with the Spin-Off, we entered into the Reimbursement Agreement, pursuant to which we have an obligation to make cash payments to Honeywell in amounts equal to 90% of payments for certain Honeywell environmental-liability payments, which include amounts billed, less 90% of Honeywell's net insurance receipts relating to such liabilities, and less 90% of the net proceeds received by Honeywell in connection with (i) affirmative claims relating to such liabilities, (ii) contributions by other parties relating to such liabilities and (iii) certain property sales. The amount payable by us in respect of such liabilities arising in any given year is subject to a\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\ncap of $140 million. During 2020, we entered into three amendments with Honeywell. See Note 19. Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Reimbursement Agreement and amendments. The amount paid during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $140 million.\nOn February 12, 2021, we entered into a fourth amendment with Honeywell. See Note 24. Subsequent events of Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for a further discussion of this amendment.\nIn addition to the sites under the Reimbursement Agreement, we have environmental expense related to sites owned and operated by Resideo ( Resideo Sites\u201d). Prior to the Spin-Off, both of these expenses were combined and were presented as environmental expense. Expenses for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable were $323 million for the period from January 1, 2018 through October 29, 2018.\nSubsequent to the Spin-Off, environmental expense was $1 million for 2020, $2 million for 2019, and $17 million for the period October 30, 2018 through December 31, 2018 and Reimbursement Agreement expense was $108 million for 2019 and $49 million for the period October 30, 2018 through December 31, 2018.\nSee Note 19.

Productivity projects have freed up capacity in our manufacturing facilities and are expected to continue to do so. We expect to continue investing to expand and modernize our existing facilities and to create capacity for new product development.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not engage in any off-balance sheet financial arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, net revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. As there remains uncertainty around the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, we intend to address and evaluate the impacts frequently. See Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for a discussion of the accounting policies most likely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRevenue - Product and service revenues are recognized when or as the Company transfers control of the promised products or services to the customer, in an amount the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services. Each distinct performance obligation within a contract is identified, and a contract's transaction price is then allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied.\nIn the sale of products, the terms of a contract or the historical business practice can give rise to variable consideration due to, but not limited to, discounts, rebates, and the right of return. The Company estimates variable consideration at the most likely amount that will be received from customers and reduces revenues recognized accordingly. The Company includes estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. The estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to the Company.\nReimbursement Agreement - In connection with the Spin-Off, we entered into the Reimbursement Agreement further described in the Capital Resources and Liquidity section.\nThrough the Reimbursement Agreement, we are subject to a number of environmental claims, remediation and, to the extent arising after the Spin-Off, hazardous exposure or toxic tort claims. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes related to the Reimbursement Agreement, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on a thorough analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and Honeywell, and, if applicable, other experts. Such analysis includes making judgments concerning matters such as the costs associated with environmental matters, the outcome of negotiations, the number and cost of pending and future claims related to the sites covered by the Reimbursement Agreement, and the impact of evidentiary requirements. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, we do not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of the Reimbursement Agreement liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of studies, litigations or settlements, and neither the timing nor the amount of the ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be determined. Expenses related to the indemnification are presented within Other expense, net in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations. See Note 19. Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for a discussion of management's judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of our environmental liabilities.\nGoodwill - We perform goodwill impairment testing annually on the first day of the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist. The goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level. We have two reporting units, Products & Solutions and ADI Global Distribution. In determining if goodwill is impaired, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value provided the loss recognized does not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nFor the 2020 annual impairment test, we determined the fair value of each reporting unit using a weighting of fair values derived from the income approach and the market approach. Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Cash flow projections are based on management's estimates of operating results, taking into consideration industry and market conditions. The\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\ndiscount rate used is based on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the business's ability to execute on the projected cash flows. The terminal value is estimated using a constant growth method which requires an assumption about the expected long-term growth rate. The estimates are based on historical data and experience, industry projections, economic conditions, and management's expectations. Under the market approach, we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of cash flow and earnings derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit and considering a reasonable control premium. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates.\nWe believe the estimates and assumptions used in the calculations are reasonable. In addition, the extent to which COVID-19 may adversely impact our business depends on future developments, which are uncertain and unpredictable, depending upon the severity and duration of the outbreak, and the effectiveness of actions taken globally to contain or mitigate its effects. Any resulting financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but may adversely affect our business and financial results. It is likely that into 2021, macroeconomic conditions may have unexpected impacts on our business. If there was an adverse change in facts and circumstances, then an impairment charge may be necessary in the future. Should the fair value of the Company's reporting units fall below its carrying amount because of reduced operating performance, market declines, changes in the discount rate, or other conditions, charges for impairment may be necessary. The Company monitors its reporting units to determine if there is an indicator of potential impairment.\nIncome Taxes - Our provision for income tax expense is based on our income, the statutory tax rates and other provisions of the tax laws applicable to us in each of the various jurisdictions in which we conduct business. These laws are complex, and their application to our facts is at times open to interpretation. The process of determining our consolidated and combined income tax expense includes significant judgments and estimates, including judgments regarding the interpretation of those laws. Our provision for income taxes and our deferred tax assets and liabilities incorporate those judgments and estimates and reflect management's best estimate of current and future income taxes to be paid.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities relate to temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of our assets and liabilities, as well as the impact of tax loss carryforwards or carrybacks. Deferred income tax expense or benefit represents the expected increase or decrease to future tax payments as these temporary differences reverse over time. Deferred tax assets are specific to the jurisdiction in which they arise and are recognized subject to management's judgment that realization of those assets is more likely than not.\u201d In making decisions regarding our ability to realize tax assets, we evaluate all positive and negative evidence, including projected future taxable income, taxable income in carryback periods, expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities, and the implementation of available tax planning strategies.\nSignificant judgment is required in evaluating tax positions. We establish additional reserves for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum recognition threshold. The approach for evaluating certain and uncertain tax positions is defined by the authoritative guidance which determines when a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. In the normal course of business, we are examined by various federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a change in estimate become known.\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nPension - We have defined benefit plans covering certain employees. The benefits are accrued over the employees' service periods. We use actuarial methods and assumptions in the valuation of defined benefit obligations and the determination of net periodic pension income or expense. Differences between actual and expected results or changes in the value of defined benefit obligations and plan assets, if any, are not recognized in earnings as they occur but rather systematically over subsequent periods when net actuarial gains or losses are in excess of 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plan's projected benefit obligation.\nA 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in a decrease of approximately $5.8 million to the net periodic benefit cost for 2020, while a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would result in an increase of approximately $12.7 million. The resulting impact on the pension benefit obligation would be a decrease of $21.6 million and an increase of $23.9 million, respectively.\nOther Matters\nLitigation, Environmental Matters and the Reimbursement Agreement\nSee Note 19. Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for a discussion of environmental and other litigation matters.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.\nCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections about our industries and our business and financial results. Forward-looking statements often include words such as anticipates,\u201d estimates,\u201d expects,\u201d projects,\u201d forecasts,\u201d intends,\u201d plans,\u201d continues,\u201d believes,\u201d may,\u201d will,\u201d goals\u201d and words and terms of similar substance in connection with discussions of future operating or financial performance. As with any projection or forecast, forward-looking statements are inherently susceptible to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Our actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed on any forward-looking statement made by us or on our behalf. Although we believe that the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K are based on reasonable assumptions, you should be aware that many factors could affect our actual financial results or results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from those in such forward-looking statements, including but not limited to:\nTable 43: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> competition from other companies in our markets and segments, as well as in new markets and emerging markets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 44: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our ability to successfully develop new technologies and products and develop and protect the intellectual property related to the same and to defend against IP threats of others;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 45: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our inability to maintain intellectual property agreements necessary to our business;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 46: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our ability to recruit and retain qualified personnel\u037e\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 47: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our ability to retain or expand relationships with significant customers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 48: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> changes in prevailing global and regional economic conditions\u037e\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 49: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the impact of pandemics, epidemics, natural disasters and other public health emergencies, such as COVID-19;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 50: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> fluctuation in financial results due to the seasonal nature of portions of our business;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 51: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality\u037e\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 52: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> inability to obtain necessary product components, production equipment or replacement parts;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 53: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> dependence upon information technology infrastructure having adequate cyber-security functionality\u037e\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 54: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> labor disputes, work stoppages, other disruptions, or the need to relocate any of our facilities\u037e\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nTable 55: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> economic, political, regulatory, foreign exchange and other risks of international operations, including the impact of tariffs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 56: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> changes in legislation or government regulations or policies\u037e\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 57: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the significant failure or inability to comply with the specifications and manufacturing requirements of our original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs\u201d) customers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 58: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the failure to increase productivity through sustainable operational improvements\u037e\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 59: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the operational constraints and financial distress of third parties\u037e\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 60: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our ability to borrow funds and access capital markets\u037e\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 61: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the amount of our obligations and nature of our contractual restrictions pursuant to, and disputes that have or may hereafter arise under, the Reimbursement Agreement and the other agreements we entered into with Honeywell in connection with the Spin-Off;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 62: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our reliance on Honeywell for the Honeywell Home trademark;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 63: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> potential material environmental liabilities\u037e\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> potential material costs as a result of warranty claims, including product recalls, and product liability actions that may be brought against us\u037e\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 65: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> potential material litigation matters;

We are a leader in the home heating, ventilation and air conditioning controls and security markets. We have a global footprint serving commercial and residential end-markets. We manage our business operations through two segments, Products & Solutions and ADI Global Distribution. Our Products & Solutions segment consists of comfort, security, residential thermal ( RTS\u201d) products and solutions. Our offerings include temperature and humidity control, thermal and combustion solutions, water and air solutions, as well as security panels, sensors, peripherals, wire and cable, communications devices, video cameras, awareness solutions, cloud infrastructure, installation and maintenance tools and related software. Our ADI Global Distribution business is the leading wholesale distributor of low-voltage security products including intrusion, access control and video products and participates significantly in the broader related markets of smart home, fire, power, audio, ProAV, networking, communications, wire and cable, enterprise connectivity, and structured wiring products. The Products & Solutions segment, consistent with our industry, has a higher gross and operating profit margin profile in comparison to the ADI Global Distribution segment.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, we made a change to our reportable segments. Previously we allocated corporate costs to the Products & Solutions segment as well as the ADI Global Distribution segment. We now report corporate costs separately, as Corporate, from the two operating segments. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2020, our Chief Operating Decision Maker moved towards making financial decisions and allocating resources based on Operating profit, rather than Segment Adjusted EBITDA. These changes were designed to better align accountability and authority, give a clearer view into the operational performance of the two segments and increase accountability for management of corporate spending.\nOur financial performance is influenced by several macro factors such as repair and remodeling activity, residential and non-residential construction, employment rates, and overall macro environment. The global outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease ( COVID-19\u201d) created economic disruption. Starting at the end of the first quarter and throughout the second quarter, we experienced constrained supply and slowed customer demand, as well as temporary closures of several of our ADI Global Distribution branches, that adversely impacted business, results of operations, and overall financial performance. Although there remains uncertainty as to the continuing implications of COVID-19, during the second half of the year customer demand improved and ongoing cost actions and transformation efforts contributed to the improvements in the Company's operations and overall financial performance.\nDuring 2020, the Products & Solutions segment revenue declined 2% compared to 2019, driven by softness in Comfort and RTS product lines offset by strength in the Security business. Operating profit was positively impacted by cost savings from transformation programs, sourcing productivity, lower charges related to obsolete and surplus inventory, and other cost reduction efforts, offset by lower revenue volumes, unfavorable sales mix, investments to support new product launches, and labor and material inflation.\nOur ADI Global Distribution business revenue increased 5% compared to 2019. Throughout 2020, the business continued its strong performance, achieving solid growth in US, including the impact from the 2020 Herman ProAV acquisition, as well as EMEA, and expansion in top product lines. ADI Global Distribution accelerated the adoption of digital tools, which is reflected in strong e-commerce growth. Operating profit was negatively impacted by unfavorable sales mix, commercial investments, acquisition related costs, and other cost inflation of $34 million, partially offset by transformation program cost savings, other expense productivity and cost reduction programs totaling $18 million.\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nCurrent Period Highlights\nNet revenues increased $83 million in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to increased pricing on certain products and acquisitions, partially offset by volume. Gross profit as a percent of net revenues was consistent at 26%. The primary drivers to the flat gross profit percentage were a 100 basis point ( bps\u201d) negative impact from unfavorable sales mix changes offset by 100 bps positive impact from transformation program cost savings. Net income for 2020 was $37 million compared to $36 million for 2019.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $17 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease was driven by transformation program cost savings, decrease in Spin-Off related expenses, and other cost reductions totaling $150 million. These decreases were partially offset by transformation program expenses and related restructuring expenses, labor and other cost inflation, commercial investments, investments to support new product launches, the expense impact of acquisitions, and labor and other expense inflation totaling $133 million.\nWe ended 2020 with $517 million in cash and cash equivalents. Net cash provided by operating activities was $244 million for the year. At December 31, 2020, accounts receivable were $863 million and inventories were $672 million.\nRecent Developments\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nThe World Health Organization ( WHO\u201d) declared COVID-19 a pandemic in March 2020. The broader implications of COVID-19 on our results of operations and overall financial performance remain uncertain. Starting at the end of the first quarter of 2020 and throughout the second quarter, we experienced constrained supply and slowed customer demand, as well as temporary closures of several of our ADI Global Distribution branches, that adversely impacted business, results of operations and overall financial performance. During the second half of 2020 customer demand improved and on-going cost actions and transformation efforts contributed to improvements in the Company's results of operations and overall financial performance. As there remains uncertainty around the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company addresses and evaluates the impacts frequently. See Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Form 10-K for further discussion of the possible impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.\nU.S. and international government responses to the COVID-19 outbreak have included shelter in place,\u201d stay at home\u201d and similar types of orders. These orders exempt certain products and services needed to maintain continuity of operations of critical infrastructure sectors as determined by the U.S. federal government and certain other countries globally. Although certain of the Company's operations are currently considered essential and exempt in the United States, Canada and certain other countries globally, there remain certain jurisdictions where there have been and may continue to be restrictions on manufacturing or operations or other government lockdown mandates or recommendations, under which we have temporarily closed certain manufacturing and sales facilities, and restricted operations in others, including manufacturing in Mexico and restricted operations in certain ADI sales branches, although these facilities have since reopened or remained opened with restricted sales activities. If any of the applicable exemptions are curtailed or revoked in the future, that could adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition. Furthermore, to the extent these exemptions do not extend to our key suppliers and customers, this could also adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition. We have also implemented work-from-home policies for a significant percentage of our employees, which could negatively impact productivity, disrupt conduct of our business in the ordinary course and delay our production timelines. Due to the significant remote workforce populations, we may also face informational technology infrastructure and connectivity issues from the vendors that we rely on for certain information technologies to administer, store and support the Company's multiple business activities. Finally, we are incurring increased costs associated with cleaning and other employee safety measures.\nOur visibility toward future performance is more limited than is typical due to the uncertainty surrounding the duration and ultimate impact of COVID-19 and the mitigation measures that are implemented by governmental authorities. We also expect business conditions to remain challenging. In response to these challenges, we will continue to focus on those factors that we can control: closely managing and controlling our expenses;\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\naligning our production schedules with demand in a proactive manner as there are changes in market conditions to minimize our cash operating costs; and pursuing further improvements in the productivity and effectiveness of our manufacturing, selling and administrative activities.\n2020 Public Offering of Common Stock\nOn November 17, 2020, we entered into an underwriting agreement (the Underwriting Agreement\u201d) which provided for the offer and sale of 17,000,000 shares of common stock at the public offering price of $15.00 per share (the Offering\u201d). The Offering closed on November 20, 2020. On December 14, 2020 the closing of the exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase an additional 2,550,000 shares of common stock of the Offering price of $15.00 per share as allowed in the Underwriting Agreement. Net proceeds received were approximately $279 million.\nAmended and Restated Credit Facilities\nOn February 12, 2021, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the A&R Credit Agreement\u201d). The A&R Credit Agreement provides for (i) a seven-year senior secured term B loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $950 million (the A&R Term B Facility\u201d) and (ii) a five-year senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million (the A&R Revolving Credit Facility\u201d and, together with the Term Loan Facilities, the A&R Senior Credit Facilities\u201d).\nBasis of Presentation\nPrior to becoming an independent publicly traded company (the Spin-Off\u201d) on October 29, 2018, our historical financial statements were prepared on a stand-alone combined basis and were derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Honeywell International Inc. ( Honeywell\u201d). Accordingly, for periods prior to October 29, 2018, our financial statements are presented on a combined basis and for the periods subsequent to October 29, 2018 are presented on a consolidated basis (collectively, the historical financial statements for all periods presented are referred to as Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\u201d). The Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The historical combined financial information prior to the Spin-Off may not be indicative of our future performance and does not necessarily reflect what our consolidated and combined results of operations, financial condition and cash flows would have been had we operated as a separate, publicly traded company during the periods presented, particularly because of changes that we experienced as a result of our separation from Honeywell, including changes in the financing, cash management, operations, cost structure, and personnel needs of our Company.\nThe combined financial statements prior to the Spin-Off include certain assets and liabilities that were held at the Honeywell corporate level but were specifically identifiable or otherwise attributable to us. Additionally, Honeywell historically provided certain services, such as legal, accounting, information technology, human resources and other infrastructure support, on our behalf. The costs of these services were allocated to us on the basis of the proportion of net revenue. Actual costs that would have been incurred if we had been a stand-alone company for the entire period being presented would depend on multiple factors, including organizational structure and strategic decisions made in various areas, including information technology and infrastructure. Both we and Honeywell consider the basis on which the expenses were allocated during the period before the Spin-Off to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided to or the benefits received by us during the periods presented.\nSince the completion of the Spin-Off, we have incurred expenditures consisting of employee-related costs, costs to start up certain stand-alone functions and information technology systems and other one-time transaction related costs. Recurring stand-alone costs include establishing the internal audit, treasury, investor relations, tax and corporate secretary functions as well as the annual expenses associated with running an independent publicly traded company including listing fees, compensation of non-employee directors, related board of director fees and other fees and expenses related to insurance, legal and external audit.\nPrior to Spin-Off, our environmental expenses for specified Honeywell properties contaminated through historical business operations ( Honeywell Sites\u201d), now subject to the Reimbursement Agreement, were reported within other expense, net in our Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations, which reflect an estimated liability for resolution of pending and future environmental-related liabilities. Prior to the Spin-Off, this estimated\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nliability was calculated as if we were responsible for 100% of the environmental-liability payments associated with certain sites. See Environmental Matters and Reimbursement Agreement sections of Note 19. Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information.\nReclassification\nOn January 1, 2020, we changed our classification of research and development expenses from Cost of goods sold to Selling, general and administrative expenses, such that research and development expenses are excluded from the calculation of Gross profit. This change had no impact on Net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share or the Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated and Combined Statements of Cash Flow or Equity. The Company determined the impact on previously issued consolidated and combined annual and interim financial statements was not material. The impact for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, was a decrease in Cost of goods sold and an increase in Gross profit and in Selling, general and administrative expenses of $87 million and $59 million, respectively. The impact of the reclassification for the year ended December 31, 2019 is also reflected in Note 7. Restructuring Charges of Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.\nIn addition, the prior year segment information was recast to present Corporate separately as well as present Operating profit which replaces Segment Adjusted EBITDA. See Note 21. Segment Financial Data of Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period financial statements to conform to the classification adopted in the current period.\nComponents of Operating Results\nNet Revenue\nWe manage our global business operations through two reportable segments, Products & Solutions and ADI Global Distribution:\nProducts & Solutions: We generate the majority of our Products & Solutions net revenue primarily from residential end-markets. Our Products & Solutions segment includes traditional products, as well as connected products, which we define as any device with the capability to be monitored or controlled from a remote location by an end-user or service provider. Our products are sold through a network of HVAC, plumbing, security, and electrical distributors including our ADI Global Distribution business, OEMs, and service providers such as HVAC contractors, security dealers and plumbers. We also sell some products via retail and online channels.\nADI Global Distribution: We generate revenue through the distribution of low-voltage electronic and security products, as well as smart home, fire, power, audio and ProAV, networking, communications, wire and cable, enterprise connectivity, and structured wiring products that are delivered through a comprehensive network of professional contractors, distributors and OEMs, as well as major retailers and online merchants. In addition to our own security products, ADI Global Distribution distributes products from industry-leading manufacturers, and also carries a line of private label products. We sell these products to contractors that service non-residential and residential end-users. 14% of ADI Global Distribution's net revenue is supplied by our Products & Solutions Segment.

This $47 million increase in cost of goods sold was primarily driven by impact of product expenses related to revenue that was attributable to the operations of the 2020 Herman ProAV acquisition, unfavorable changes in sales mix, and material and labor inflation totaling $137 million. The increased costs were partially offset by the favorable impact of sourcing productivity, transformation programs cost savings, lower charges related to obsolete and surplus inventory, lower spin-related costs, and other cost reductions totaling $90 million.\nThe primary drivers of flat gross profit percentage were a 100 bps negative impact from changes in sales mix, offset by 100 bps favorable impact of transformation programs cost savings.\n2019 compared with 2018\nCost of goods sold for 2019 was $3,711 million, an increase of $309 million, or 9%, from $3,402 million in 2018. This $309 million increase in cost of goods sold was primarily driven by higher revenue in the ADI Global Distribution segment, material and labor inflation and increased production costs including charges related to obsolete and surplus inventory, changes in sales mix, increased headquarter allocations in the period prior to the Spin-Off, expenses related to transformation programs and related restructuring costs, and Spin-Off related costs totaling $435 million. The increased costs were partially offset by sourcing productivity, foreign currency translation, lower environmental expense, and savings in other miscellaneous costs of goods sold totaling $126 million.\nThe primary drivers to the decrease in gross profit percentage were a 200 bps impact from changes in sales mix, 100 bps impact from material and labor inflation and fixed production costs, and 100 bps impact from headquarter allocations previously classified in selling, general and administrative expense in the period prior to the Spin-Off.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nTable 27: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2020 compared with 2019\nSelling, general and administrative expense for 2020 was $1,002 million, a decrease of $17 million, from $1,019 million in 2019.

At December 31, 2020, there were no borrowings and no letters of credit issued under our $350 million Revolving Credit Facility. \n \u2022 Historically, we have delivered positive cash flows from operations. Operating cash flows from continuing operations were $244 million, $23 million and $462 million for the three years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. \nLiquidity\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate of sales growth, market acceptance of our products, the timing and extent of research and development projects, potential acquisitions of companies or technologies and the expansion of our sales and marketing activities. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and availability under our credit facilities are sufficient to meet our capital requirements through at least the next 12 months, although we could be required, or could elect, to seek additional funding prior to that time. We may enter into acquisitions or strategic arrangements in the future which also could require us to seek additional equity or debt financing.\nCredit Agreement\nOn October 25, 2018, we entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d), which was subsequently amended on November 26, 2019 (the Credit Agreement First Amendment\u201d) and on November 16, 2020 (the Credit Agreement Second Amendment\u201d).

As of December 31, 2020, there were no borrowings and no Letters of Credit outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nThe Senior Credit Facilities were subject to an interest rate and interest period which we will elect. As amended, the margin was 2.25% per annum (for LIBOR loans) and 1.25% per annum (for alternate base rate ABR\u201d loans) in respect of the Term B Loan Facility, and based on our leverage ratio, from 2.25% per annum to 1.75% per annum (for LIBOR loans) and 1.25% to 0.75% per annum (for ABR loans) for the Term A Loan Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility.\nThe Credit Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants customary for financings of this type that, among other things, limit our and our subsidiaries' ability to incur additional indebtedness or liens, to dispose of assets, to make certain fundamental changes, enter into restrictive agreements, to make certain investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions, to prepay certain indebtedness and to pay dividends, to make other distributions or redemptions/repurchases, in respect of our and our subsidiaries' equity interests, to engage in transactions with affiliates or amend certain material documents. In addition, the Credit Agreement also contains financial maintenance and coverage covenants.

Subject to certain limitations, the Senior Credit Facilities are or will be secured on a first priority basis by: (x) a perfected security interest in the equity interests of each direct subsidiary of the Company and each Guarantor under the Senior Credit Facilities (subject to certain customary exceptions) and (y) perfected, security interests in, and mortgages on, substantially all tangible and intangible personal property and material real property of the Company and each of the Guarantors under the Senior Credit Facilities, subject, in each case, to certain exceptions.\nOn February 12, 2021, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the A&R Credit Agreement\u201d) which replaced the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and refinanced all amounts that were outstanding under these facilities.\nAmended and Restated Credit Agreement\nOn February 12, 2021, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the A&R Credit Agreement\u201d). The A&R Credit Agreement provides for (i) a seven-year senior secured term B loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $950 million (the A&R Term B Facility\u201d) and (ii) a five-year senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million (the A&R Revolving Credit Facility\u201d and, together with the Term Loan Facilities, the A&R Senior Credit Facilities\u201d).\nWe are obligated to make quarterly principal payments of approximately $2.4 million throughout the term of the A&R Term B Facility according to the amortization provisions in the A&R Credit Agreement. In addition to paying interest on outstanding borrowings under the A&R Revolving Credit Facility, we are required to pay a quarterly commitment fee based on the unused portion of the A&R Revolving Credit Facility. Borrowings under the A&R Credit Agreement can be prepaid at our option without premium or penalty other than a 1.00% prepayment premium that may be payable in connection with certain repricing transactions within a certain period of time after the closing date. Up to $75 million may be utilized under the A&R Revolving Credit Facility for the issuance of letters of credit to the Company or any of our subsidiaries. Letters of credit are available for issuance under the A&R Credit Agreement on terms and conditions customary for financings of this kind, which issuances will reduce the available funds under the A&R Revolving Credit Facility.\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nThe A&R Senior Credit Facilities are subject to an interest rate and interest period which we will elect. If we choose to make a base rate borrowing on an overnight basis, the interest rate will be based on the highest of (1) the rate of interest last quoted by The Wall Street Journal as the prime rate\u201d in the United States, (2) the greater of the federal funds effective rate and the overnight bank funding rate, plus 0.5% and (3) the one month adjusted LIBOR rate, plus 1.00% per annum. For the A&R Term Loan B, the applicable LIBOR rate will not be less than 0.50% per annum. The applicable margin for the A&R Term B Facility is 2.25% per annum (for LIBOR loans) and 1.25% per annum (for base rate loans). The applicable margin for the A&R Revolving Credit Facility varies from 2.25% per annum to 1.75% per annum (for LIBOR loans) and 1.25% to 0.75% per annum (for base rate loans) based on our leverage ratio. Accordingly, the interest rates for the A&R Senior Credit Facilities will fluctuate during the term of the A&R Credit Agreement based on changes in the base rate, LIBOR rate or future changes in our leverage ratio. Interest payments with respect to the borrowings are required either on a quarterly basis (for base rate loans) or at the end of each interest period (for LIBOR loans) or, if the duration of the applicable interest period exceeds three months, then every three months.\nThe A&R Credit Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants customary for financings of this type that, among other things, limit our and our subsidiaries' ability to incur additional indebtedness or liens, to dispose of assets, to make certain fundamental changes, enter into restrictive agreements, to make certain investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions, to prepay certain indebtedness and to pay dividends, to make other distributions or redemptions/repurchases, in respect of our and our subsidiaries' equity interests, to engage in transactions with affiliates or amend certain material documents. In addition, the A&R Revolving Credit Facility also contains certain financial maintenance covenants. The A&R Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, including with respect to a failure to make payments under the A&R Senior Credit Facilities, cross-default, certain bankruptcy and insolvency events and customary change of control events.\nAll obligations under the A&R Senior Credit Facilities are or will be unconditionally guaranteed jointly and severally, by: (a) our Company and (b) substantially all of the direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of our Company that are organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia (collectively, the Guarantors\u201d). The Guarantors entered into a guarantee under the A&R Credit Agreement concurrently with the effectiveness of the A&R Credit Agreement. Subject to certain limitations, the A&R Senior Credit Facilities are or will be secured on a first priority basis by: (x) a perfected security interest in the equity interests of each direct subsidiary of the Company and each Guarantor under the A&R Senior Credit Facilities (subject to certain customary exceptions) and (y) perfected, security interests in, and mortgages on, substantially all tangible and intangible personal property and material real property of the Company and each of the Guarantors under the A&R Senior Credit Facilities, subject, in each case, to certain exceptions. The Company and the Guarantors entered into security documents concurrently with effectiveness of the A&R Credit Agreement.\nSenior Notes\nIn October of 2018, we issued $400 million in principal amount of 6.125% senior unsecured notes due in 2026 (the Senior Notes\u201d). The Senior Notes guarantees are unsecured senior debt obligations of the Senior Notes guarantors. The net proceeds from the borrowings under the Senior Credit Facilities and the offering of the Senior Notes were used as part of financing the Spin-Off.\nInterest expense presented in the Statements of Operations is from the Senior Notes and Senior Credit Facilities, which includes the amortization of debt issuance cost and debt discounts.\nOn February 16, 2021 we redeemed $140 million in principal amount of the Senior Notes at a redemption price of 106.125% of par plus accrued interest.\nReimbursement Agreement\nIn connection with the Spin-Off, we entered into the Reimbursement Agreement, pursuant to which we have an obligation to make cash payments to Honeywell in amounts equal to 90% of payments for certain Honeywell environmental-liability payments, which include amounts billed, less 90% of Honeywell's net insurance receipts relating to such liabilities, and less 90% of the net proceeds received by Honeywell in connection with (i) affirmative claims relating to such liabilities, (ii) contributions by other parties relating to such liabilities and (iii) certain property sales. The amount payable by us in respect of such liabilities arising in any given year is subject to a\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\ncap of $140 million. During 2020, we entered into three amendments with Honeywell. See Note 19. Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Reimbursement Agreement and amendments. The amount paid during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $140 million.\nOn February 12, 2021, we entered into a fourth amendment with Honeywell. See Note 24. Subsequent events of Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for a further discussion of this amendment.\nIn addition to the sites under the Reimbursement Agreement, we have environmental expense related to sites owned and operated by Resideo ( Resideo Sites\u201d). Prior to the Spin-Off, both of these expenses were combined and were presented as environmental expense. Expenses for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable were $323 million for the period from January 1, 2018 through October 29, 2018.\nSubsequent to the Spin-Off, environmental expense was $1 million for 2020, $2 million for 2019, and $17 million for the period October 30, 2018 through December 31, 2018 and Reimbursement Agreement expense was $108 million for 2019 and $49 million for the period October 30, 2018 through December 31, 2018.\nSee Note 19. Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for further discussion.\nCash Flow Summary for the Years Ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\nOur cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, as reflected in the audited Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements are summarized as follows:\nTable 35: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by (used for):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (103\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (112\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (74\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (53\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (167\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of exchange rate changes on cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (143\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2020 compared with 2019\nCash provided by operating activities for 2020 increased by $221 million, due to higher operating profit and lower cash taxes paid.\nCash used for investing activities for 2020 decreased by $9 million, primarily due to a decrease of $25 million cash paid for capital expenditures, partially offset by an increase of $18 million cash paid for acquisitions and miscellaneous other items.\nCash provided by financing activities for 2020 increased by $306 million. The increase was primarily due to $279 million of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock, a decrease in cash used of $22 million from non-operating obligations with Honeywell and other miscellaneous items.\nA detailed discussion of the prior year 2019 to 2018 year-over-year changes are not included herein and can be found in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section in the 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed February 27, 2020.\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nContractual Obligations and Probable Liability Payments\nFollowing is a summary of our significant contractual obligations and probable liability payments at December 31, 2020:\nTable 36: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest payments on long-term debt (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reimbursement Agreement payments (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Estimated environmental liability payments (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Minimum operating lease payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations (6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,433\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n 1) The table excludes tax liability payments, including those for unrecognized tax benefits.

Subsequent to December 31, 2020, the Company entered into the A&R Credit Agreement which modified the contractual obligations related to the Company's long-term debt as described the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. \n 3) Interest payments are estimated based on the interest rate applicable as of December 31, 2020. \n 4) In connection with the Spin-Off, we entered into the Reimbursement Agreement with Honeywell. As of December 31, 2020, $591 million was deemed probable and reasonably estimable, however, it is possible we could pay $140 million per year (exclusive of any late payment fees up to 5% per annum) until the earlier of: (1) December 31, 2043; or (2) December 31 of the third consecutive year during which the annual reimbursement obligation (including in respect of deferred payment amounts) has been less than $25 million. For further discussion on the Reimbursement Agreement refer to Note 19. Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. \n 5) Represents estimated environmental liability payments deemed probable and reasonably estimable for sites which we own and are directly responsible for. \n 6) Purchase obligations are entered into with various vendors in the normal course of business and are consistent with our expected requirements. \nCapital Expenditures\nWe believe our capital spending in recent years has been sufficient to maintain efficient production capacity, to implement important product and process redesigns and to expand capacity to meet increased demand. Productivity projects have freed up capacity in our manufacturing facilities and are expected to continue to do so. We expect to continue investing to expand and modernize our existing facilities and to create capacity for new product development.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not engage in any off-balance sheet financial arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, net revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. As there remains uncertainty around the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, we intend to address and evaluate the impacts frequently. See Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for a discussion of the accounting policies most likely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRevenue - Product and service revenues are recognized when or as the Company transfers control of the promised products or services to the customer, in an amount the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services. Each distinct performance obligation within a contract is identified, and a contract's transaction price is then allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied.\nIn the sale of products, the terms of a contract or the historical business practice can give rise to variable consideration due to, but not limited to, discounts, rebates, and the right of return. The Company estimates variable consideration at the most likely amount that will be received from customers and reduces revenues recognized accordingly. The Company includes estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. The estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to the Company.\nReimbursement Agreement - In connection with the Spin-Off, we entered into the Reimbursement Agreement further described in the Capital Resources and Liquidity section.\nThrough the Reimbursement Agreement, we are subject to a number of environmental claims, remediation and, to the extent arising after the Spin-Off, hazardous exposure or toxic tort claims. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes related to the Reimbursement Agreement, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on a thorough analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and Honeywell, and, if applicable, other experts. Such analysis includes making judgments concerning matters such as the costs associated with environmental matters, the outcome of negotiations, the number and cost of pending and future claims related to the sites covered by the Reimbursement Agreement, and the impact of evidentiary requirements. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, we do not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of the Reimbursement Agreement liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of studies, litigations or settlements, and neither the timing nor the amount of the ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be determined. Expenses related to the indemnification are presented within Other expense, net in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations. See Note 19. Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for a discussion of management's judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of our environmental liabilities.\nGoodwill - We perform goodwill impairment testing annually on the first day of the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist. The goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level. We have two reporting units, Products & Solutions and ADI Global Distribution. In determining if goodwill is impaired, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value provided the loss recognized does not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nFor the 2020 annual impairment test, we determined the fair value of each reporting unit using a weighting of fair values derived from the income approach and the market approach. Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Cash flow projections are based on management's estimates of operating results, taking into consideration industry and market conditions. The\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\ndiscount rate used is based on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the business's ability to execute on the projected cash flows. The terminal value is estimated using a constant growth method which requires an assumption about the expected long-term growth rate. The estimates are based on historical data and experience, industry projections, economic conditions, and management's expectations. Under the market approach, we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of cash flow and earnings derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit and considering a reasonable control premium. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates.\nWe believe the estimates and assumptions used in the calculations are reasonable. In addition, the extent to which COVID-19 may adversely impact our business depends on future developments, which are uncertain and unpredictable, depending upon the severity and duration of the outbreak, and the effectiveness of actions taken globally to contain or mitigate its effects. Any resulting financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but may adversely affect our business and financial results. It is likely that into 2021, macroeconomic conditions may have unexpected impacts on our business. If there was an adverse change in facts and circumstances, then an impairment charge may be necessary in the future. Should the fair value of the Company's reporting units fall below its carrying amount because of reduced operating performance, market declines, changes in the discount rate, or other conditions, charges for impairment may be necessary. The Company monitors its reporting units to determine if there is an indicator of potential impairment.\nIncome Taxes - Our provision for income tax expense is based on our income, the statutory tax rates and other provisions of the tax laws applicable to us in each of the various jurisdictions in which we conduct business. These laws are complex, and their application to our facts is at times open to interpretation. The process of determining our consolidated and combined income tax expense includes significant judgments and estimates, including judgments regarding the interpretation of those laws. Our provision for income taxes and our deferred tax assets and liabilities incorporate those judgments and estimates and reflect management's best estimate of current and future income taxes to be paid.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities relate to temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of our assets and liabilities, as well as the impact of tax loss carryforwards or carrybacks. Deferred income tax expense or benefit represents the expected increase or decrease to future tax payments as these temporary differences reverse over time. Deferred tax assets are specific to the jurisdiction in which they arise and are recognized subject to management's judgment that realization of those assets is more likely than not.\u201d In making decisions regarding our ability to realize tax assets, we evaluate all positive and negative evidence, including projected future taxable income, taxable income in carryback periods, expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities, and the implementation of available tax planning strategies.\nSignificant judgment is required in evaluating tax positions. We establish additional reserves for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum recognition threshold. The approach for evaluating certain and uncertain tax positions is defined by the authoritative guidance which determines when a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. In the normal course of business, we are examined by various federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a change in estimate become known.\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nPension - We have defined benefit plans covering certain employees. The benefits are accrued over the employees' service periods. We use actuarial methods and assumptions in the valuation of defined benefit obligations and the determination of net periodic pension income or expense. Differences between actual and expected results or changes in the value of defined benefit obligations and plan assets, if any, are not recognized in earnings as they occur but rather systematically over subsequent periods when net actuarial gains or losses are in excess of 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plan's projected benefit obligation.\nA 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in a decrease of approximately $5.8 million to the net periodic benefit cost for 2020, while a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would result in an increase of approximately $12.7 million. The resulting impact on the pension benefit obligation would be a decrease of $21.6 million and an increase of $23.9 million, respectively.\nOther Matters\nLitigation, Environmental Matters and the Reimbursement Agreement\nSee Note 19. Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for a discussion of environmental and other litigation matters.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.\nCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Our ADI Global Distribution business is the leading wholesale distributor of low-voltage security products including intrusion, access control and video products and participates significantly in the broader related markets of smart home, fire, power, audio, ProAV, networking, communications, wire and cable, enterprise connectivity, and structured wiring products. The Products & Solutions segment, consistent with our industry, has a higher gross and operating profit margin profile in comparison to the ADI Global Distribution segment.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, we made a change to our reportable segments. Previously we allocated corporate costs to the Products & Solutions segment as well as the ADI Global Distribution segment. We now report corporate costs separately, as Corporate, from the two operating segments. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2020, our Chief Operating Decision Maker moved towards making financial decisions and allocating resources based on Operating profit, rather than Segment Adjusted EBITDA. These changes were designed to better align accountability and authority, give a clearer view into the operational performance of the two segments and increase accountability for management of corporate spending.\nOur financial performance is influenced by several macro factors such as repair and remodeling activity, residential and non-residential construction, employment rates, and overall macro environment. The global outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease ( COVID-19\u201d) created economic disruption. Starting at the end of the first quarter and throughout the second quarter, we experienced constrained supply and slowed customer demand, as well as temporary closures of several of our ADI Global Distribution branches, that adversely impacted business, results of operations, and overall financial performance. Although there remains uncertainty as to the continuing implications of COVID-19, during the second half of the year customer demand improved and ongoing cost actions and transformation efforts contributed to the improvements in the Company's operations and overall financial performance.\nDuring 2020, the Products & Solutions segment revenue declined 2% compared to 2019, driven by softness in Comfort and RTS product lines offset by strength in the Security business. Operating profit was positively impacted by cost savings from transformation programs, sourcing productivity, lower charges related to obsolete and surplus inventory, and other cost reduction efforts, offset by lower revenue volumes, unfavorable sales mix, investments to support new product launches, and labor and material inflation.\nOur ADI Global Distribution business revenue increased 5% compared to 2019. Throughout 2020, the business continued its strong performance, achieving solid growth in US, including the impact from the 2020 Herman ProAV acquisition, as well as EMEA, and expansion in top product lines. ADI Global Distribution accelerated the adoption of digital tools, which is reflected in strong e-commerce growth. Operating profit was negatively impacted by unfavorable sales mix, commercial investments, acquisition related costs, and other cost inflation of $34 million, partially offset by transformation program cost savings, other expense productivity and cost reduction programs totaling $18 million.\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nCurrent Period Highlights\nNet revenues increased $83 million in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to increased pricing on certain products and acquisitions, partially offset by volume. Gross profit as a percent of net revenues was consistent at 26%. The primary drivers to the flat gross profit percentage were a 100 basis point ( bps\u201d) negative impact from unfavorable sales mix changes offset by 100 bps positive impact from transformation program cost savings. Net income for 2020 was $37 million compared to $36 million for 2019.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $17 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease was driven by transformation program cost savings, decrease in Spin-Off related expenses, and other cost reductions totaling $150 million. These decreases were partially offset by transformation program expenses and related restructuring expenses, labor and other cost inflation, commercial investments, investments to support new product launches, the expense impact of acquisitions, and labor and other expense inflation totaling $133 million.\nWe ended 2020 with $517 million in cash and cash equivalents. Net cash provided by operating activities was $244 million for the year. At December 31, 2020, accounts receivable were $863 million and inventories were $672 million.\nRecent Developments\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nThe World Health Organization ( WHO\u201d) declared COVID-19 a pandemic in March 2020. The broader implications of COVID-19 on our results of operations and overall financial performance remain uncertain. Starting at the end of the first quarter of 2020 and throughout the second quarter, we experienced constrained supply and slowed customer demand, as well as temporary closures of several of our ADI Global Distribution branches, that adversely impacted business, results of operations and overall financial performance. During the second half of 2020 customer demand improved and on-going cost actions and transformation efforts contributed to improvements in the Company's results of operations and overall financial performance. As there remains uncertainty around the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company addresses and evaluates the impacts frequently. See Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Form 10-K for further discussion of the possible impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.\nU.S. and international government responses to the COVID-19 outbreak have included shelter in place,\u201d stay at home\u201d and similar types of orders. These orders exempt certain products and services needed to maintain continuity of operations of critical infrastructure sectors as determined by the U.S. federal government and certain other countries globally. Although certain of the Company's operations are currently considered essential and exempt in the United States, Canada and certain other countries globally, there remain certain jurisdictions where there have been and may continue to be restrictions on manufacturing or operations or other government lockdown mandates or recommendations, under which we have temporarily closed certain manufacturing and sales facilities, and restricted operations in others, including manufacturing in Mexico and restricted operations in certain ADI sales branches, although these facilities have since reopened or remained opened with restricted sales activities. If any of the applicable exemptions are curtailed or revoked in the future, that could adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition. Furthermore, to the extent these exemptions do not extend to our key suppliers and customers, this could also adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition. We have also implemented work-from-home policies for a significant percentage of our employees, which could negatively impact productivity, disrupt conduct of our business in the ordinary course and delay our production timelines. Due to the significant remote workforce populations, we may also face informational technology infrastructure and connectivity issues from the vendors that we rely on for certain information technologies to administer, store and support the Company's multiple business activities. Finally, we are incurring increased costs associated with cleaning and other employee safety measures.\nOur visibility toward future performance is more limited than is typical due to the uncertainty surrounding the duration and ultimate impact of COVID-19 and the mitigation measures that are implemented by governmental authorities. We also expect business conditions to remain challenging. In response to these challenges, we will continue to focus on those factors that we can control: closely managing and controlling our expenses;\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\naligning our production schedules with demand in a proactive manner as there are changes in market conditions to minimize our cash operating costs; and pursuing further improvements in the productivity and effectiveness of our manufacturing, selling and administrative activities.\n2020 Public Offering of Common Stock\nOn November 17, 2020, we entered into an underwriting agreement (the Underwriting Agreement\u201d) which provided for the offer and sale of 17,000,000 shares of common stock at the public offering price of $15.00 per share (the Offering\u201d). The Offering closed on November 20, 2020. On December 14, 2020 the closing of the exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase an additional 2,550,000 shares of common stock of the Offering price of $15.00 per share as allowed in the Underwriting Agreement. Net proceeds received were approximately $279 million.\nAmended and Restated Credit Facilities\nOn February 12, 2021, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the A&R Credit Agreement\u201d). The A&R Credit Agreement provides for (i) a seven-year senior secured term B loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $950 million (the A&R Term B Facility\u201d) and (ii) a five-year senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million (the A&R Revolving Credit Facility\u201d and, together with the Term Loan Facilities, the A&R Senior Credit Facilities\u201d).\nBasis of Presentation\nPrior to becoming an independent publicly traded company (the Spin-Off\u201d) on October 29, 2018, our historical financial statements were prepared on a stand-alone combined basis and were derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Honeywell International Inc. ( Honeywell\u201d). Accordingly, for periods prior to October 29, 2018, our financial statements are presented on a combined basis and for the periods subsequent to October 29, 2018 are presented on a consolidated basis (collectively, the historical financial statements for all periods presented are referred to as Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements\u201d). The Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The historical combined financial information prior to the Spin-Off may not be indicative of our future performance and does not necessarily reflect what our consolidated and combined results of operations, financial condition and cash flows would have been had we operated as a separate, publicly traded company during the periods presented, particularly because of changes that we experienced as a result of our separation from Honeywell, including changes in the financing, cash management, operations, cost structure, and personnel needs of our Company.\nThe combined financial statements prior to the Spin-Off include certain assets and liabilities that were held at the Honeywell corporate level but were specifically identifiable or otherwise attributable to us. Additionally, Honeywell historically provided certain services, such as legal, accounting, information technology, human resources and other infrastructure support, on our behalf. The costs of these services were allocated to us on the basis of the proportion of net revenue. Actual costs that would have been incurred if we had been a stand-alone company for the entire period being presented would depend on multiple factors, including organizational structure and strategic decisions made in various areas, including information technology and infrastructure. Both we and Honeywell consider the basis on which the expenses were allocated during the period before the Spin-Off to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided to or the benefits received by us during the periods presented.\nSince the completion of the Spin-Off, we have incurred expenditures consisting of employee-related costs, costs to start up certain stand-alone functions and information technology systems and other one-time transaction related costs. Recurring stand-alone costs include establishing the internal audit, treasury, investor relations, tax and corporate secretary functions as well as the annual expenses associated with running an independent publicly traded company including listing fees, compensation of non-employee directors, related board of director fees and other fees and expenses related to insurance, legal and external audit.\nPrior to Spin-Off, our environmental expenses for specified Honeywell properties contaminated through historical business operations ( Honeywell Sites\u201d), now subject to the Reimbursement Agreement, were reported within other expense, net in our Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations, which reflect an estimated liability for resolution of pending and future environmental-related liabilities. Prior to the Spin-Off, this estimated\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nliability was calculated as if we were responsible for 100% of the environmental-liability payments associated with certain sites. See Environmental Matters and Reimbursement Agreement sections of Note 19. Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information.\nReclassification\nOn January 1, 2020, we changed our classification of research and development expenses from Cost of goods sold to Selling, general and administrative expenses, such that research and development expenses are excluded from the calculation of Gross profit. This change had no impact on Net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share or the Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated and Combined Statements of Cash Flow or Equity. The Company determined the impact on previously issued consolidated and combined annual and interim financial statements was not material. The impact for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, was a decrease in Cost of goods sold and an increase in Gross profit and in Selling, general and administrative expenses of $87 million and $59 million, respectively. The impact of the reclassification for the year ended December 31, 2019 is also reflected in Note 7. Restructuring Charges of Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.\nIn addition, the prior year segment information was recast to present Corporate separately as well as present Operating profit which replaces Segment Adjusted EBITDA. See Note 21. Segment Financial Data of Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period financial statements to conform to the classification adopted in the current period.\nComponents of Operating Results\nNet Revenue\nWe manage our global business operations through two reportable segments, Products & Solutions and ADI Global Distribution:\nProducts & Solutions: We generate the majority of our Products & Solutions net revenue primarily from residential end-markets. Our Products & Solutions segment includes traditional products, as well as connected products, which we define as any device with the capability to be monitored or controlled from a remote location by an end-user or service provider. Our products are sold through a network of HVAC, plumbing, security, and electrical distributors including our ADI Global Distribution business, OEMs, and service providers such as HVAC contractors, security dealers and plumbers. We also sell some products via retail and online channels.\nADI Global Distribution: We generate revenue through the distribution of low-voltage electronic and security products, as well as smart home, fire, power, audio and ProAV, networking, communications, wire and cable, enterprise connectivity, and structured wiring products that are delivered through a comprehensive network of professional contractors, distributors and OEMs, as well as major retailers and online merchants. In addition to our own security products, ADI Global Distribution distributes products from industry-leading manufacturers, and also carries a line of private label products. We sell these products to contractors that service non-residential and residential end-users. 14% of ADI Global Distribution's net revenue is supplied by our Products & Solutions Segment. Management estimates that in 2020 approximately two-thirds of ADI Global Distribution's net revenue was attributed to non-residential end markets and one-third to residential end markets.\nCost of Goods Sold\nProducts & Solutions: Cost of goods sold includes costs associated with raw materials, assembly, shipping and handling of those products, costs of personnel-related expenses, including pension benefits, and equipment associated with manufacturing support, logistics and quality assurance, non-research and development engineering costs, and costs of certain intangible assets.\nADI Global Distribution: Cost of goods sold consists primarily of inventory-related costs and includes labor and personnel-related expenses.\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nSelling, general and administrative expense includes trademark royalty expenses, sales incentives and commissions, professional fees, legal fees, promotional and advertising expenses, personnel-related expenses, including stock compensation expense and pension benefits, and research and development expenses. In addition, prior to the Spin-Off, our selling, general and administrative expense included an allocated portion of general corporate expenses.\nOther Expense, Net\nOther expense, net consists primarily of Reimbursement Agreement expenses (gains) for certain environmental claims related to approximately 230 sites or groups of sites that are undergoing environmental remediation under U.S. federal or state law and agency oversight for contamination associated with Honeywell historical business operations. Prior to the Spin-Off, other expense, net included the environmental expenses related to these same sites. For further information see Note 19. Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for discussion of environmental and the Reimbursement Agreement. Other expense, net also includes foreign exchange gains and losses.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists of interest on our short and long-term obligations, including our senior notes, term credit facility, and revolving credit facility. Interest expense on our obligations includes contractual interest, amortization of the debt discount and amortization of deferred financing costs.\nTax Expense (Benefit)\nProvision for income taxes includes both domestic and foreign income taxes at the applicable statutory tax rates adjusted for U.S. taxation of foreign earnings, non-deductible expenses and other permanent differences.\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\nThe following table sets forth our Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations for the periods presented:\nConsolidated and Combined Statements of Operations\n(In millions except share and per share data)\n\nNet Revenue\n\nNet revenue increased 2% in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to increase in pricing on certain products and acquisitions, partially offset by reduced volume. Net revenue increased 3% in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to an increase in volume and pricing on certain products, partially offset by foreign exchange translation.\nFurther discussion of net revenue by segment can be found in the Review of Business Segments section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nCost of Goods Sold\n\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\n2020 compared with 2019\nCost of goods sold for 2020 was $3,758 million, an increase of $47 million, or 1%, from $3,711 million in 2019. This $47 million increase in cost of goods sold was primarily driven by impact of product expenses related to revenue that was attributable to the operations of the 2020 Herman ProAV acquisition, unfavorable changes in sales mix, and material and labor inflation totaling $137 million. The increased costs were partially offset by the favorable impact of sourcing productivity, transformation programs cost savings, lower charges related to obsolete and surplus inventory, lower spin-related costs, and other cost reductions totaling $90 million.\nThe primary drivers of flat gross profit percentage were a 100 bps negative impact from changes in sales mix, offset by 100 bps favorable impact of transformation programs cost savings.\n2019 compared with 2018\nCost of goods sold for 2019 was $3,711 million, an increase of $309 million, or 9%, from $3,402 million in 2018. This $309 million increase in cost of goods sold was primarily driven by higher revenue in the ADI Global Distribution segment, material and labor inflation and increased production costs including charges related to obsolete and surplus inventory, changes in sales mix, increased headquarter allocations in the period prior to the Spin-Off, expenses related to transformation programs and related restructuring costs, and Spin-Off related costs totaling $435 million. The increased costs were partially offset by sourcing productivity, foreign currency translation, lower environmental expense, and savings in other miscellaneous costs of goods sold totaling $126 million.\nThe primary drivers to the decrease in gross profit percentage were a 200 bps impact from changes in sales mix, 100 bps impact from material and labor inflation and fixed production costs, and 100 bps impact from headquarter allocations previously classified in selling, general and administrative expense in the period prior to the Spin-Off.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\n\n2020 compared with 2019\nSelling, general and administrative expense for 2020 was $1,002 million, a decrease of $17 million, from $1,019 million in 2019. The decrease was driven by transformation programs cost savings, decrease in Spin-Off related expenses, and other cost reductions totaling $150 million. These decreases were partially offset by transformation program expenses and related restructuring costs, commercial investments, investments to support new product launches, and the expense impact of acquisitions totaling $133 million.\n2019 compared with 2018\nSelling, general and administrative expense for 2019 was $1,019 million, an increase of $87 million from $932 million in 2018. The increase was driven by greater Spin-Off related costs, increased research and development spend, increased royalty fees associated with the Trademark License Agreement, transformation program expenses and related restructuring costs, higher legal expenses, the expense impact of acquisitions, and labor and other expense inflation totaling $175 million. These increases were partially offset by reduced headquarter cost allocations, transformation programs cost savings, foreign currency translation, and miscellaneous cost reductions totaling $88 million.\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nOther Expense, Net\n\n2020 compared with 2019\nOther expense, net for 2020 was $147 million, an increase of $29 million from $118 million in 2019. The increase is mainly due to a $38 million increase in expense from the Reimbursement Agreement, and $4 million of increased expense relating to foreign exchange. These increases were offset by $13 million decrease in non-operating pension related expense.\n2019 compared with 2018\nOther expense, net for 2019 was $118 million, a decrease of $251 million from $369 million in 2018. The decrease is mainly due to lower environmental remediation expense, now subject to and presented as Reimbursement Agreement expense subsequent to the Spin-Off.\nTax Expense (Benefit)\n\n2020 compared with 2019\nThe effective tax rate increase in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily attributable to the mix of earnings across the jurisdictions in which we operate, changes in estimates related to prior years, and non-deductible expenses. A significant driver of the high tax rate in both 2020 and 2019 is that the Reimbursement Agreement is generally non-deductible for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n2019 compared with 2018\nThe effective tax rate increase in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily attributable to tax benefits generated in 2018 related to the internal restructuring of Resideo's business in advance of the Spin-Off, currency impacts on withholding taxes on undistributed foreign earnings, and adjustments to the provisional tax amount related to U.S. Tax Reform, partially offset by decreases in tax expense related to Global Intangible Low Taxed Income ( GILTI\u201d) and non-deductible expenses. A significant driver of the high tax rate in 2019 is that the Reimbursement Agreement is generally non-deductible for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nReview of Business Segments\nProducts & Solutions\n\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\n2020 compared with 2019\nProducts & Solutions revenue declined 2% in 2020 compared to 2019, driven by softness in Comfort and RTS product lines offset by strength in the Security business. Operating profit increased from $327 million in 2019 to $407 million in 2020, or 24%. Operating profit was positively impacted by cost savings from transformation programs, sourcing productivity, lower charges related to obsolete and surplus inventory and other cost reduction efforts totaling $210 million. These cost reductions offset lower revenue volumes, unfavorable sales mix, investments to support new product launches, and labor and material inflation totaling $130 million.\n2019 compared with 2018\nProducts & Solutions revenue remained flat in 2019 compared to 2018, driven primarily by strength in the Security business, offset by softness in Comfort and RTS product lines. Operating profit declined from $591 million in 2018 to $327 million in 2019, or 45%. Operating profit was negatively impacted by unfavorable sales mix, increased costs related to transformation program expenses and related restructuring expenses and Spin-Off, increased functional expenses previously captured in corporate costs prior to Spin-Off, increased charges related to obsolete and surplus inventory, increased royalty fee paid to Honeywell associated with the Trademark License Agreement, investments to support new product launches, and labor and material inflation totaling $356 million. Negative impacts were partially offset by increased selling prices, sourcing productivity, lower environmental expense, savings from transformation programs, and miscellaneous cost reductions totaling $92 million.\nADI Global Distribution\n\n2020 compared with 2019\nADI Global Distribution revenue increased 5% in 2020 compared to 2019, highlighted by strong growth in the U.S., including the impact from the 2020 Herman ProAV acquisition, as well as EMEA. Operating profit decreased from $210 million in 2019 to $194 million in 2020, or 8%. Operating profit was negatively impacted by commercial investments, unfavorable sales mix, acquisition related costs, and other cost inflation totaling $34 million. Negative impacts were partially offset by transformation program cost savings, other expense productivity and cost reduction programs totaling $18 million.\n2019 compared with 2018\nADI Global Distribution revenue increased 6% in 2019 compared to 2018, driven by increased sales volume growth across all regions. Operating profit increased from $205 million in 2018 to $210 million in 2019, or 2%. Operating profit was positively impacted by increased volume, transformation program cost savings, and other expense productivity and cost reduction programs totaling $38 million. Positive impacts were partially offset by increased functional expenses previously captured in corporate costs prior to Spin-Off, commercial investments, increased expenses related to transformation programs, unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates, and other cost inflation totaling $33 million.\nCorporate\n\n2020 compared with 2019\nCorporate costs for 2020 were $290 million, an increase of $11 million, from $279 million in 2019, or 4%, and were negatively impacted by costs related to transformation programs and related restructuring expenses,\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nincreased bonus payouts from improved performance of the business, increase in service cost related to pension, and labor and other inflation totaling $59 million. Negative impacts were partially offset by transformation program cost savings, reduced Spin-Off related costs, other expense productivity and cost reduction programs totaling $48 million.\n2019 compared with 2018\nCorporate costs for 2019 were $279 million, a decrease of $24 million, from $303 million in 2018, or 8%, and were positively impacted by reduced functional expenses previously captured in corporate costs prior to Spin-Off, transformation program cost savings, decreased bonus payouts related to business performance, and other expense productivity and cost reduction programs totaling $74 million. Positive impacts were partially offset by increased Spin-Off related costs, higher legal expenses, increased costs related to transformation programs and related restructuring expenses, increase in service cost related to pension, and labor and other inflation totaling $50 million.\nRestructuring Charges\nDuring 2019, we retained industry-recognized experts in supply chain optimization and organizational excellence to assist in a comprehensive financial and operational review which was focused on product cost and gross margin improvement, and general and administrative expenses simplification. Certain restructuring actions have been implemented under this program as well as previous programs. These restructuring actions generated incremental (net) pre-tax savings of $53 million in 2020. Cash spending related to our restructuring actions was $35 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and was funded through operating cash flows.\nNet restructuring and related expenses were $40 million, $37 million and $5 million for December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, primarily related to severance.\nFor further discussion of restructuring activities, refer to Note 7. Restructuring Charges of Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nOur liquidity is primarily dependent on our ability to continue to generate positive cash flows from operations. Additional liquidity may also be provided through access to the financial capital markets and a committed global credit facility. The following is a summary of our liquidity position:\n \u2022 As of December 31, 2020, total cash and cash equivalents were $517 million, of which 22% were held by foreign subsidiaries. At December 31, 2020, there were no borrowings and no letters of credit issued under our $350 million Revolving Credit Facility. \n \u2022 Historically, we have delivered positive cash flows from operations. Operating cash flows from continuing operations were $244 million, $23 million and $462 million for the three years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. \nLiquidity\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate of sales growth, market acceptance of our products, the timing and extent of research and development projects, potential acquisitions of companies or technologies and the expansion of our sales and marketing activities. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and availability under our credit facilities are sufficient to meet our capital requirements through at least the next 12 months, although we could be required, or could elect, to seek additional funding prior to that time. We may enter into acquisitions or strategic arrangements in the future which also could require us to seek additional equity or debt financing.\nCredit Agreement\nOn October 25, 2018, we entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d), which was subsequently amended on November 26, 2019 (the Credit Agreement First Amendment\u201d) and on November 16, 2020 (the Credit Agreement Second Amendment\u201d). The Credit Agreement provides for (i) a seven-year senior\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nsecured first-lien term B loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $475 million (the Term B Facility\u201d)\u037e (ii) a five-year senior secured first-lien term A loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $350 million (the Term A Facility\u201d and, together with the Term B Facility, the Term Loans or Term Loan Facilities\u201d)\u037e and (iii) a five-year senior secured first-lien revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $350 million (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d and, together with the Term Loan Facilities, the Senior Credit Facilities\u201d). As of December 31, 2020, there were no borrowings and no Letters of Credit outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nThe Senior Credit Facilities were subject to an interest rate and interest period which we will elect. As amended, the margin was 2.25% per annum (for LIBOR loans) and 1.25% per annum (for alternate base rate ABR\u201d loans) in respect of the Term B Loan Facility, and based on our leverage ratio, from 2.25% per annum to 1.75% per annum (for LIBOR loans) and 1.25% to 0.75% per annum (for ABR loans) for the Term A Loan Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility.\nThe Credit Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants customary for financings of this type that, among other things, limit our and our subsidiaries' ability to incur additional indebtedness or liens, to dispose of assets, to make certain fundamental changes, enter into restrictive agreements, to make certain investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions, to prepay certain indebtedness and to pay dividends, to make other distributions or redemptions/repurchases, in respect of our and our subsidiaries' equity interests, to engage in transactions with affiliates or amend certain material documents. In addition, the Credit Agreement also contains financial maintenance and coverage covenants. The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, including with respect to a failure to make payments under the Senior Credit Facilities, cross-default, certain bankruptcy and insolvency events and customary change of control events.\nAll obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities are or will be unconditionally guaranteed jointly and severally, by: (a) our Company and (b) substantially all of the direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of our Company that are organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia (collectively, the Guarantors\u201d). Subject to certain limitations, the Senior Credit Facilities are or will be secured on a first priority basis by: (x) a perfected security interest in the equity interests of each direct subsidiary of the Company and each Guarantor under the Senior Credit Facilities (subject to certain customary exceptions) and (y) perfected, security interests in, and mortgages on, substantially all tangible and intangible personal property and material real property of the Company and each of the Guarantors under the Senior Credit Facilities, subject, in each case, to certain exceptions.\nOn February 12, 2021, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the A&R Credit Agreement\u201d) which replaced the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and refinanced all amounts that were outstanding under these facilities.\nAmended and Restated Credit Agreement\nOn February 12, 2021, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the A&R Credit Agreement\u201d). The A&R Credit Agreement provides for (i) a seven-year senior secured term B loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $950 million (the A&R Term B Facility\u201d) and (ii) a five-year senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million (the A&R Revolving Credit Facility\u201d and, together with the Term Loan Facilities, the A&R Senior Credit Facilities\u201d).\nWe are obligated to make quarterly principal payments of approximately $2.4 million throughout the term of the A&R Term B Facility according to the amortization provisions in the A&R Credit Agreement. In addition to paying interest on outstanding borrowings under the A&R Revolving Credit Facility, we are required to pay a quarterly commitment fee based on the unused portion of the A&R Revolving Credit Facility. Borrowings under the A&R Credit Agreement can be prepaid at our option without premium or penalty other than a 1.00% prepayment premium that may be payable in connection with certain repricing transactions within a certain period of time after the closing date. Up to $75 million may be utilized under the A&R Revolving Credit Facility for the issuance of letters of credit to the Company or any of our subsidiaries. Letters of credit are available for issuance under the A&R Credit Agreement on terms and conditions customary for financings of this kind, which issuances will reduce the available funds under the A&R Revolving Credit Facility.\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nThe A&R Senior Credit Facilities are subject to an interest rate and interest period which we will elect. If we choose to make a base rate borrowing on an overnight basis, the interest rate will be based on the highest of (1) the rate of interest last quoted by The Wall Street Journal as the prime rate\u201d in the United States, (2) the greater of the federal funds effective rate and the overnight bank funding rate, plus 0.5% and (3) the one month adjusted LIBOR rate, plus 1.00% per annum. For the A&R Term Loan B, the applicable LIBOR rate will not be less than 0.50% per annum. The applicable margin for the A&R Term B Facility is 2.25% per annum (for LIBOR loans) and 1.25% per annum (for base rate loans). The applicable margin for the A&R Revolving Credit Facility varies from 2.25% per annum to 1.75% per annum (for LIBOR loans) and 1.25% to 0.75% per annum (for base rate loans) based on our leverage ratio. Accordingly, the interest rates for the A&R Senior Credit Facilities will fluctuate during the term of the A&R Credit Agreement based on changes in the base rate, LIBOR rate or future changes in our leverage ratio. Interest payments with respect to the borrowings are required either on a quarterly basis (for base rate loans) or at the end of each interest period (for LIBOR loans) or, if the duration of the applicable interest period exceeds three months, then every three months.\nThe A&R Credit Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants customary for financings of this type that, among other things, limit our and our subsidiaries' ability to incur additional indebtedness or liens, to dispose of assets, to make certain fundamental changes, enter into restrictive agreements, to make certain investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions, to prepay certain indebtedness and to pay dividends, to make other distributions or redemptions/repurchases, in respect of our and our subsidiaries' equity interests, to engage in transactions with affiliates or amend certain material documents. In addition, the A&R Revolving Credit Facility also contains certain financial maintenance covenants. The A&R Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, including with respect to a failure to make payments under the A&R Senior Credit Facilities, cross-default, certain bankruptcy and insolvency events and customary change of control events.\nAll obligations under the A&R Senior Credit Facilities are or will be unconditionally guaranteed jointly and severally, by: (a) our Company and (b) substantially all of the direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of our Company that are organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia (collectively, the Guarantors\u201d). The Guarantors entered into a guarantee under the A&R Credit Agreement concurrently with the effectiveness of the A&R Credit Agreement. Subject to certain limitations, the A&R Senior Credit Facilities are or will be secured on a first priority basis by: (x) a perfected security interest in the equity interests of each direct subsidiary of the Company and each Guarantor under the A&R Senior Credit Facilities (subject to certain customary exceptions) and (y) perfected, security interests in, and mortgages on, substantially all tangible and intangible personal property and material real property of the Company and each of the Guarantors under the A&R Senior Credit Facilities, subject, in each case, to certain exceptions. The Company and the Guarantors entered into security documents concurrently with effectiveness of the A&R Credit Agreement.\nSenior Notes\nIn October of 2018, we issued $400 million in principal amount of 6.125% senior unsecured notes due in 2026 (the Senior Notes\u201d). The Senior Notes guarantees are unsecured senior debt obligations of the Senior Notes guarantors. The net proceeds from the borrowings under the Senior Credit Facilities and the offering of the Senior Notes were used as part of financing the Spin-Off.\nInterest expense presented in the Statements of Operations is from the Senior Notes and Senior Credit Facilities, which includes the amortization of debt issuance cost and debt discounts.\nOn February 16, 2021 we redeemed $140 million in principal amount of the Senior Notes at a redemption price of 106.125% of par plus accrued interest.\nReimbursement Agreement\nIn connection with the Spin-Off, we entered into the Reimbursement Agreement, pursuant to which we have an obligation to make cash payments to Honeywell in amounts equal to 90% of payments for certain Honeywell environmental-liability payments, which include amounts billed, less 90% of Honeywell's net insurance receipts relating to such liabilities, and less 90% of the net proceeds received by Honeywell in connection with (i) affirmative claims relating to such liabilities, (ii) contributions by other parties relating to such liabilities and (iii) certain property sales. The amount payable by us in respect of such liabilities arising in any given year is subject to a\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\ncap of $140 million. During 2020, we entered into three amendments with Honeywell. See Note 19. Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Reimbursement Agreement and amendments. The amount paid during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $140 million.\nOn February 12, 2021, we entered into a fourth amendment with Honeywell. See Note 24. Subsequent events of Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for a further discussion of this amendment.\nIn addition to the sites under the Reimbursement Agreement, we have environmental expense related to sites owned and operated by Resideo ( Resideo Sites\u201d). Prior to the Spin-Off, both of these expenses were combined and were presented as environmental expense. Expenses for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable were $323 million for the period from January 1, 2018 through October 29, 2018.\nSubsequent to the Spin-Off, environmental expense was $1 million for 2020, $2 million for 2019, and $17 million for the period October 30, 2018 through December 31, 2018 and Reimbursement Agreement expense was $108 million for 2019 and $49 million for the period October 30, 2018 through December 31, 2018.\nSee Note 19. Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for further discussion.\nCash Flow Summary for the Years Ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\nOur cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, as reflected in the audited Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements are summarized as follows:\n\n2020 compared with 2019\nCash provided by operating activities for 2020 increased by $221 million, due to higher operating profit and lower cash taxes paid.\nCash used for investing activities for 2020 decreased by $9 million, primarily due to a decrease of $25 million cash paid for capital expenditures, partially offset by an increase of $18 million cash paid for acquisitions and miscellaneous other items.\nCash provided by financing activities for 2020 increased by $306 million. The increase was primarily due to $279 million of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock, a decrease in cash used of $22 million from non-operating obligations with Honeywell and other miscellaneous items.\nA detailed discussion of the prior year 2019 to 2018 year-over-year changes are not included herein and can be found in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section in the 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed February 27, 2020.\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nContractual Obligations and Probable Liability Payments\nFollowing is a summary of our significant contractual obligations and probable liability payments at December 31, 2020:\n\n 1) The table excludes tax liability payments, including those for unrecognized tax benefits. See Note 9. Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. \n 2) Assumes all long-term debt is outstanding until scheduled maturity. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, the Company entered into the A&R Credit Agreement which modified the contractual obligations related to the Company's long-term debt as described the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. \n 3) Interest payments are estimated based on the interest rate applicable as of December 31, 2020. \n 4) In connection with the Spin-Off, we entered into the Reimbursement Agreement with Honeywell. As of December 31, 2020, $591 million was deemed probable and reasonably estimable, however, it is possible we could pay $140 million per year (exclusive of any late payment fees up to 5% per annum) until the earlier of: (1) December 31, 2043; or (2) December 31 of the third consecutive year during which the annual reimbursement obligation (including in respect of deferred payment amounts) has been less than $25 million. For further discussion on the Reimbursement Agreement refer to Note 19. Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. \n 5) Represents estimated environmental liability payments deemed probable and reasonably estimable for sites which we own and are directly responsible for. \n 6) Purchase obligations are entered into with various vendors in the normal course of business and are consistent with our expected requirements. \nCapital Expenditures\nWe believe our capital spending in recent years has been sufficient to maintain efficient production capacity, to implement important product and process redesigns and to expand capacity to meet increased demand. Productivity projects have freed up capacity in our manufacturing facilities and are expected to continue to do so. We expect to continue investing to expand and modernize our existing facilities and to create capacity for new product development.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not engage in any off-balance sheet financial arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, net revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. As there remains uncertainty around the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, we intend to address and evaluate the impacts frequently. See Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for a discussion of the accounting policies most likely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRevenue - Product and service revenues are recognized when or as the Company transfers control of the promised products or services to the customer, in an amount the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services. Each distinct performance obligation within a contract is identified, and a contract's transaction price is then allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied.\nIn the sale of products, the terms of a contract or the historical business practice can give rise to variable consideration due to, but not limited to, discounts, rebates, and the right of return. The Company estimates variable consideration at the most likely amount that will be received from customers and reduces revenues recognized accordingly. The Company includes estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. The estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to the Company.\nReimbursement Agreement - In connection with the Spin-Off, we entered into the Reimbursement Agreement further described in the Capital Resources and Liquidity section.\nThrough the Reimbursement Agreement, we are subject to a number of environmental claims, remediation and, to the extent arising after the Spin-Off, hazardous exposure or toxic tort claims. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes related to the Reimbursement Agreement, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on a thorough analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and Honeywell, and, if applicable, other experts. Such analysis includes making judgments concerning matters such as the costs associated with environmental matters, the outcome of negotiations, the number and cost of pending and future claims related to the sites covered by the Reimbursement Agreement, and the impact of evidentiary requirements. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, we do not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of the Reimbursement Agreement liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of studies, litigations or settlements, and neither the timing nor the amount of the ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be determined. Expenses related to the indemnification are presented within Other expense, net in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations. See Note 19. Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for a discussion of management's judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of our environmental liabilities.\nGoodwill - We perform goodwill impairment testing annually on the first day of the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist. The goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level. We have two reporting units, Products & Solutions and ADI Global Distribution. In determining if goodwill is impaired, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value provided the loss recognized does not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nFor the 2020 annual impairment test, we determined the fair value of each reporting unit using a weighting of fair values derived from the income approach and the market approach. Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Cash flow projections are based on management's estimates of operating results, taking into consideration industry and market conditions. The\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\ndiscount rate used is based on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the business's ability to execute on the projected cash flows. The terminal value is estimated using a constant growth method which requires an assumption about the expected long-term growth rate. The estimates are based on historical data and experience, industry projections, economic conditions, and management's expectations. Under the market approach, we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of cash flow and earnings derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit and considering a reasonable control premium. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates.\nWe believe the estimates and assumptions used in the calculations are reasonable. In addition, the extent to which COVID-19 may adversely impact our business depends on future developments, which are uncertain and unpredictable, depending upon the severity and duration of the outbreak, and the effectiveness of actions taken globally to contain or mitigate its effects. Any resulting financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but may adversely affect our business and financial results. It is likely that into 2021, macroeconomic conditions may have unexpected impacts on our business. If there was an adverse change in facts and circumstances, then an impairment charge may be necessary in the future. Should the fair value of the Company's reporting units fall below its carrying amount because of reduced operating performance, market declines, changes in the discount rate, or other conditions, charges for impairment may be necessary. The Company monitors its reporting units to determine if there is an indicator of potential impairment.\nIncome Taxes - Our provision for income tax expense is based on our income, the statutory tax rates and other provisions of the tax laws applicable to us in each of the various jurisdictions in which we conduct business. These laws are complex, and their application to our facts is at times open to interpretation. The process of determining our consolidated and combined income tax expense includes significant judgments and estimates, including judgments regarding the interpretation of those laws. Our provision for income taxes and our deferred tax assets and liabilities incorporate those judgments and estimates and reflect management's best estimate of current and future income taxes to be paid.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities relate to temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of our assets and liabilities, as well as the impact of tax loss carryforwards or carrybacks. Deferred income tax expense or benefit represents the expected increase or decrease to future tax payments as these temporary differences reverse over time. Deferred tax assets are specific to the jurisdiction in which they arise and are recognized subject to management's judgment that realization of those assets is more likely than not.\u201d In making decisions regarding our ability to realize tax assets, we evaluate all positive and negative evidence, including projected future taxable income, taxable income in carryback periods, expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities, and the implementation of available tax planning strategies.\nSignificant judgment is required in evaluating tax positions. We establish additional reserves for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum recognition threshold. The approach for evaluating certain and uncertain tax positions is defined by the authoritative guidance which determines when a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. In the normal course of business, we are examined by various federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a change in estimate become known.\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nPension - We have defined benefit plans covering certain employees. The benefits are accrued over the employees' service periods. We use actuarial methods and assumptions in the valuation of defined benefit obligations and the determination of net periodic pension income or expense. Differences between actual and expected results or changes in the value of defined benefit obligations and plan assets, if any, are not recognized in earnings as they occur but rather systematically over subsequent periods when net actuarial gains or losses are in excess of 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plan's projected benefit obligation.\nA 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in a decrease of approximately $5.8 million to the net periodic benefit cost for 2020, while a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would result in an increase of approximately $12.7 million. The resulting impact on the pension benefit obligation would be a decrease of $21.6 million and an increase of $23.9 million, respectively.\nOther Matters\nLitigation, Environmental Matters and the Reimbursement Agreement\nSee Note 19. Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for a discussion of environmental and other litigation matters.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.\nCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
