MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting the consolidated operating results, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows of our company as of and for the periods presented below. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our description of the business in Item 1, \u201cBusiness\u201d in this report, and our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs of our management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in or implied by forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed herein, particularly in the section entitled \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nAs of December 31, 2015, we are one of the world's largest providers of sand-based proppant solutions and for nearly 40 years have been a pioneer in the development of high performance proppants used by Exploration & Production (\u201cE&P\u201d) companies to enhance the productivity of their oil and gas wells. We offer the broadest range of proppants available in the market today, including high quality sand and a variety of resin-coated products. All of our frac sand exceeds API specifications. Additionally, for more than 120 years, we and our predecessor companies have provided high quality sand-based products, strong technical leadership and applications knowledge to end users in the Industrial & Recreational (\u201cI&R\u201d) markets.\nAs one of the industry leaders, our asset base includes 798 million tons of proven and probable mineral reserves, which we believe is one of the largest reserve bases in the industry. Due to the continuing challenging conditions in the oil and gas markets, we continue to adjust our operational footprint to minimize our costs. As of March 2016, we have 11 sand processing facilities (7 of which are active) with 14.8 million tons of annual sand processing capacity. In 2015, we closed our sand processing facilities in Readfield, Wisconsin and Wexford, Michigan and idled our facilities in Brewer, Missouri, Shakopee, Minnesota, and Hager City, Wisconsin. We also have 10 coating facilities (6 of which are active) with 2.3 million tons of annual coating capacity. Our coating facilities include operations in Mexico, Denmark and China, through which we serve international oil and gas markets. In 2015, we closed our resin-coating facility in Bridgman, Michigan and idled resin-coating facilities in Voca, Texas and Cutler, Illinois and SSP-coating facilities in Fresno, Texas.\nWe are capable of Class I railroad deliveries to each of North America's major oil and gas producing basins and also have the flexibility to ship our product via barge, marine terminals and trucks to reach our customers as needed. We operate an integrated logistics platform consisting of 43 active proppant distribution terminals and a fleet of approximately 10,100 railcars (net of subleases). We have recently expanded our unit train destinations to two production facilities and seven in-basin terminals, which reduce freight costs and improve cycle times for our rail car fleet. In order to better align our logistics network with customer demand and to reduce costs, we discontinued activity at ten transloading terminals and opened seven new terminals in 2015.\nOur operations are organized into two segments based on the primary end markets we serve: (i) Proppant Solutions and (ii) Industrial & Recreational (I&R) Products. Our Proppant Solutions segment predominantly provides sand-based proppants for use in hydraulic fracturing operations throughout the U.S. and Canada, Argentina, Mexico, China, northern Europe and the United Arab Emirates. Our I&R segment provides raw, coated, and custom blended sands to the foundry, building products, glass, turf and landscape and filtration industries primarily in North America. We believe our two market segments are complementary. Our ability to sell to a wide range of customers across multiple end markets allows us to maximize the recovery of our reserve base within our mining operations and to reduce the cyclicality of our earnings.\nRecent Trends and Outlook\nRecent trends driving demand for our proppants and commercial silica include:\nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Level of drilling activity and demand for proppants. Through 2014, the growth in the use of horizontal drilling utilizing hydraulic fracturing as a means to extract hydrocarbons from shale formations dramatically increased the number of oil and gas rigs operating in North America. This increased drilling activity contributed to substantial growth in demand for proppants from 2009 to 2014. However, during the fourth quarter of 2014, increasing global supply of oil, in conjunction with slowing growth of global oil demand, created downward pressure on crude oil prices, which has continued through 2015. As a result, various E&P companies reduced drilling and capital programs, resulting in significantly reduced rig counts. North American rig counts have fallen significantly from September 2014 to December 2015, which has resulted in reduced drilling activity and has negatively impacted the demand for proppants in 2015. During the same period, however, E&P companies, in partnership with oilfield service companies, are continuing to refine their well designs and hydraulic fracturing techniques to maximize hydrocarbon recovery from each well. These techniques vary based on formation and well geology, but some of the more pervasive recent trends include longer lateral drilling lengths coupled with an increased number of hydraulic fracturing stages per well. E&P and oilfield service companies have also been increasing the amount of proppant used per frac stage and, together, these techniques have greatly increased the volume of proppant used in the completion of each well (referred to as \u201cproppant intensity\u201d). The trend of increasing proppant intensity has offset, to some extent, the decrease in demand for proppants resulting from reduced rig counts and drilling activity. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Shift in drilling activity and demand mix. The level of drilling activity for oil and gas can have an impact on the demand for proppant and the mix of proppant we sell. In 2014, with the rapid growth of drilling deep wells in regions such as the Permian region, and drilling wells in regions that were prone to the flowback of proppant, we saw a rapid increase in demand for our resin-coated proppants. In late 2014 and 2015, lower crude oil prices have caused E&P companies to seek ways to reduce short-term operating costs, and, as a result, we have seen reduced demand for our resin-coated proppants. Further, lower crude oil prices have caused many operators to drill fewer of the deeper and more expensive wells in an effort to reduce production costs, which has also had an adverse impact on the demand for resin-coated proppants, particularly those designed to add strength for higher closer pressures. There can be ongoing shifts in grade sizes that impact the demand for our raw sand proppants. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 147: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Volatility in selling prices for proppants. The rapid growth in demand for proppants in 2014 driven by relatively high oil and gas prices and high levels of drilling activity caused selling prices for proppants to increase as the market for proppants was generally undersupplied. This imbalance of supply and demand caused many proppant suppliers to expand production capacity in anticipation of continued growth in demand. However, the rapid decline in oil and gas prices that occurred later in 2014 and in 2015 led to reduced drilling activity and reduced demand for proppants. As a result, the proppant market is in a position of oversupply, which has caused selling prices for all proppants to decline significantly in 2015. It is unclear when global oil and gas prices and increased drilling activity will begin to increase the demand for proppants, or when industry production capacity will contract enough to bring supply and demand more into balance and put upward pressure on selling prices. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 148: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Demand for in-basin delivery of proppant. In recent years, many customers sought to outsource proppant logistics and to purchase proppant at the basin, allowing them to focus on their core competencies, minimize inventory costs, and maximize flexibility. In 2015, approximately 75% of our proppant sales volume was sold in-basin, down from approximately 85% in 2014. In the second half of 2015, we saw an increase in demand from larger oilfield service customers for large volume shipments that can be taken directly from our plants. With our increasing capability to provide low-cost unit train shipments directly to large customers while also shipping unit trains to certain of our own in-basin terminals, we are well-equipped to take advantage of shifting demand. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 149: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Increased demand for unit train deliveries. With the shift of larger oilfield services customers toward shipments taken directly from our plants, there is also a greater demand for shipments via unit trains to\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 150: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> enhance the economics of deliveries. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we shipped 68 unit trains representing approximately 74% of Northern White sand volumes with a total of 208 unit trains shipped during the year. We are well-positioned to help our customers lower their costs and improve delivery, as we now have seven unit train-capable destinations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 151: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Continued stable demand in industrial end markets. Sales in our I&R Products segment are driven by macroeconomic factors such as housing starts, light vehicle sales, repair and remodel activity and industrial production. To the extent these demand drivers continue on their current trends, we expect that demand for our commercial silica products will remain relatively stable. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nHow We Generate Our Sales\nWe derive our sales by mining, processing and transporting sand-based proppants and silica sand products that our customers purchase for use in a wide variety of applications. In our Proppant Solutions business for the year ended December 31, 2015, we sold approximately 75% of our North American proppant volume through our network of terminals at selling prices that are set by local market dynamics. The remaining volume in the Proppant Solutions business is sold to customers directly from our mining and production facilities. The average selling prices for products sold through our terminals are higher than the average selling prices for comparable products sold from our production facilities due to costs incurred to handle and transport the products from the production facilities to the terminals. Generally, logistics costs can comprise 70-80% of the delivered cost of Northern White frac sand, depending on the basin into which the product is delivered. Due to the closer proximity of distribution terminals to our production facility, the amount of logistics costs included in the total delivered cost of our Texas Gold frac sand generally will be lower than that for our Northern White frac sand.\nWe primarily sell products under supply agreements with terms that vary by contract. Generally, the selling prices specified in our contracts are based on market prices. We believe that this approach to contract pricing allows us to reduce prices and retain or gain volume in market downcycles and capture higher prices in market upcycles. Our contracts have a variety of volume provisions. While certain of our contracts have no minimum volume requirements, certain of the agreements require the customer to purchase a specified percentage of its proppant requirements or a minimum volume of proppant from us. Certain of these minimum volume contracts include a provision which may trigger penalties if the purchased volume does not meet the required minimums.\nOur Proppant Solutions segment represented 86% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015. A large portion of our sales is generated by our top customers, and the loss of, or significant reduction in, purchases by our largest customers could adversely affect our operations. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our top ten proppant customers collectively represented 70% and 66% of our revenues, respectively. During the same periods, sales in the aggregate to our top two customers, Halliburton Company (\u201cHalliburton\u201d) and FTS International Services, LLC (\u201cFTSI\u201d), collectively accounted for 43% and 36% of our revenues, respectively.\nOur I&R business segment has over 770 customers and represented 14% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015. In our I&R business, we use our network of I&R distribution terminals to sell products from our production facilities to distributors which sell the product to the end user.\nThe Costs of Conducting Our Business\nThe principal costs involved in operating our business are logistics costs associated with transporting products from our production facilities to our terminals; payroll costs for personnel at our production, terminal and administrative facilities; resin and other raw materials and supplies used in the production of our products; and maintenance and repair costs at our production facilities. We own or lease most of our sand reserves, the combination of which, we believe, helps us maintain a very competitive cost position.\nLogistics costs, including freight, railcar leases, demurrage and handling, represented approximately 37% and 33% of our revenues during the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Freight costs primarily represent charges to transport our product by rail, but we also ship product by truck and barge. In order to move product by rail, we lease a substantial number of railcars under operating leases with durations ranging from three to seven years. We currently have approximately 8,900 railcars under lease and 1,200 railcars made available to us from our customers, giving us a total fleet of approximately 10,100 railcars (net of 200 cars currently subleased). Demurrage costs are charged by the railroads based on the time a railcar spends on the rail in excess of the allotted time. These costs can vary significantly from period to period driven by high levels of rail activity at a terminal and changes in the timing of fulfilling customer orders. Handling costs are incurred at our distribution and terminal facilities to move product from one mode of transportation to another (e.g., truck to railcar) and to move product into storage facilities. Storage costs are incurred when railcars are temporarily taken out of service and stored at a rail yard or storage facility.\nLabor costs, including wages and benefits, represented approximately 13% and 10% of revenues during the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Approximately 16% of our workforce was party to collective bargaining contracts as of December 31, 2015.\nWe use a significant amount of resins and additives in the production of our coated products in both our Proppant Solutions and I&R businesses. We purchase these resins under supply agreements that contain annual pricing adjustments based on the cost of phenol, the primary component of the resins we buy. We also supply a portion of our resin requirements from our resin manufacturing facility located in Michigan. The cost of resins and additives represented approximately 8% and 11% of revenues during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nOur selling, general and administrative costs, which include the wages and benefits costs noted above, represented approximately 10% and 8% of revenues during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These costs are related to our corporate operations, including costs for the sales and marketing; research and development; finance; legal; and environmental, health and safety functions of our organization. Since becoming a public company, we incur additional legal, accounting, insurance and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. These requirements include compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as well as other rules implemented by the SEC, and applicable stock exchange rules.\nWe capitalize the costs of our mining and processing equipment and depreciate it over its expected useful life. We also capitalize the costs to remove overburden on our sand reserves for our surface mines and amortize them based on the actual tons mined. Depreciation, depletion, and amortization costs represented approximately 8% and 4% of revenues during the years ended December, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Repair and maintenance costs that do not involve the replacement of major components of our equipment and facilities are expensed as incurred. These repair and maintenance costs can be significant due to the abrasive nature of our products and represented approximately 3% and 2% of revenues during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nHow We Evaluate Our Business\nOur management uses a variety of financial and operational metrics to analyze our performance across our Proppant Solutions and I&R Products segments. This segmentation is based on the primary end markets we serve, our management structure and the financial information that is reviewed by the Chief Executive Officer in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. We evaluate the performance of these segments based on their volumes sold, average selling price and segment contribution margin. We do not evaluate the performance of the segments on a margin percentage basis, as that is a function of the channel in which a given product is sold (for example, in-basin sales generate higher selling price but comparable per ton margin, resulting in reduced margin percentage) and product mix. Additionally, we consider a number of factors in evaluating the\nperformance of the business as a whole, including total volumes sold and Adjusted EBITDA. We view these metrics as important factors in evaluating our profitability and review these measurements frequently to analyze trends and make decisions.\nSegment Contribution Margin\nSegment contribution margin is a key metric that management uses to evaluate our operating performance and to determine resource allocation between segments. Segment contribution margin is defined as total revenues less the cost of goods sold to produce and deliver the products, less selling, general and administrative expenses that are directly attributable to each segment. The definition excludes certain corporate costs not associated with the operations of the segment. These unallocated costs include costs related to corporate functional areas such as administration, accounting, information technology, human resources, research and development, business development and sustainable development.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures that are used by management and external users of our financial statements, such as lenders and rating agencies.\nWe define EBITDA as net income before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation, depletion and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before non-cash stock-based compensation, management fees and reimbursement of expenses to our financial sponsor, transaction expenses, impairment of assets, loss on extinguishment of debt, gain or loss on disposal of certain assets, and other non-cash or non-recurring income or expenses.\nManagement believes EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful because they allow us to more effectively evaluate our operating performance and compare the results of our operations from period to period without regard to our financing methods, capital structure or non-recurring or non-operating expenses. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered as alternatives to, or more meaningful than, net income or cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP as indicators of our operating performance or liquidity. Certain items excluded from EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company's financial performance, such as a company's cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are components of EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA. Although we attempt to determine EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in a manner that is consistent with other companies in our industry, our computations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are widely followed measures of operating performance and may also be used by investors to measure our ability to meet debt service requirements.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:\nTable 152: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

$527.8 million, or 39%, to $828.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $1,356.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, due to decreased volumes, pricing compression, and product mix primarily in the Proppant Solutions segment.\nRevenues in the Proppant Solutions segment decreased $522.1 million, or 42%, to $710.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $1,232.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Total volumes decreased 14% to 6.2 million tons in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2014. Raw frac sand volumes decreased slightly to 5.4 million tons in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 5.7 million tons in the year ended December 31, 2014. The average selling price for raw frac sand in 2015 decreased approximately 19% from 2014. Coated proppant volumes decreased 48% to 0.8 million tons in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 1.5 million tons in the year ended December 31, 2014. The average selling price for resin-coated proppants in 2015 decreased approximately 18% from 2014. The decrease in Proppant Solutions revenue was due to pricing declines, a shift in sales toward FOB plant shipments, and declines in resin-coated proppant volumes primarily in the second half of the year.\nRevenues in the I&R Products segment decreased $5.6 million, or 5%, to $118.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $124.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Volumes declined slight to 2.3 million tons in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2.4 million tons in the year ended December 31, 2014. I&R segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 was impacted by downward pressure in the U.S. foundry market as well as a shift in customer and product mix in the business.\nSegment Contribution Margin\nContribution margin in the Proppant Solutions segment decreased $360.0 million, or 84%, to $70.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $430.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in segment contribution margin was primarily driven by lower volumes, changes in product mix, decreased selling prices, higher operating costs per ton due to lower volumes over which to absorb fixed costs such as railcars and logistics, and non-recurring impairment and restructuring charges in the year ended December 31, 2015. The Proppant Solutions segment contribution margin includes non-recurring impairment and restructuring charges of $82.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nContribution margin in the I&R Products segment decreased $9.2 million, or 27%, to $25.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $34.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily driven by non-recurring restructuring charges associated with plant closures, such as impairment of property, plant, and equipment, and liabilities associated with pension withdrawal and land reclamation. The Industrial & Recreational Products segment contribution margin includes non-recurring impairment and restructuring charges of $13.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased $33.6 million, or 29%, to $80.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $114.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. SG&A attributable to our segments decreased $8.8 million. Corporate SG&A costs decreased $24.8 million primarily due to lower costs associated with incentive plans, pension contributions, and reduced workforce this year as well as non-recurring costs in the prior year associated with the October 2014 Initial Public Offering.\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization increased $7.4 million, or 12%, to $66.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $59.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in depreciation is due to more assets placed in service primarily related to the Wedron plant expansion.\nIncome (Loss) from Operations\nIncome (loss) from operations decreased $341.8 million, or 110%, to a loss of $30.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to income of $311.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Earnings in 2015 were largely impacted by non-recurring impairment and restructuring charges of $96.7 million as well as declines in contribution margins due to lower volumes and decreased selling prices.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $1.4 million, or 2%, to $62.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $60.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to interest rate swap agreements, entered into in 2013, that became effective October 2015.\nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes\nThe provision (benefit) for income taxes decreased $79.4 million, or 103%, to arrive at a benefit of $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to a provision of $77.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Income before income taxes decreased $341.9 million or 138% to a loss of $93.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to income of $248.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The primary items impacting the tax provision include an increase in the valuation allowance primarily related to U.S. alternative minimum tax credits and U.S. research credits; a goodwill impairment charge with no corresponding income tax benefit; and the accrual of deferred taxes on our accumulated foreign undistributed earnings resulting from a change in our indefinite reinvestment assertion. These unfavorable items were partially offset by a 9.7% effective income tax benefit related to depletion.\nNet Income (Loss)\nNet income (loss) decreased $262.6 million, or 154%, to a loss of $92.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to income of $170.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 due to the factors noted above.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased $259.2 million, or 65%, to $138.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $397.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decline in Adjusted EBITDA was largely due to declines in proppant pricing and volumes.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013\nRevenues\nRevenues increased $368.1 million, or 37%, to $1,356.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $988.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to increased raw and resin-coated frac sand volumes in our Proppant Solutions segment and, to a lesser extent, increases in the selling price of certain grades of raw frac sand during the year.\nRevenues in the Proppant Solutions segment increased $376.0 million, or 44%, to $1,232.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $856.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Total volumes increased 40% to 7.2 million tons in 2014 compared to 5.1 million tons in 2013. Raw frac sand volumes increased 1.6 million tons, or 40%, to 5.7 million tons compared to 4.1 million tons during this period. The average selling price for raw sand increased 7%, which was primarily the result of an increase in the proportion of raw sand sold through our terminal network and an increase in the selling price of certain grades of sand during the year, partially offset by a shift in volumes sold toward finer grades of raw sand (which generally carry lower selling prices than coarser grades) and increases in sales of Texas Gold brown sand since the acquisition of the Voca facility as part of the acquisition of the proppant assets from FTSI in September 2013. Coated proppant volumes increased 43% to 1.5 million tons in 2014 compared to 1.0 million tons in 2013. The average selling price for resin-coated proppants decreased 2%, which was primarily the result of customer mix and the full year impact of selling price declines taken in 2013, partially offset by a shift in volumes sold towards higher-priced products.\nRevenues in the I&R Products segment decreased $8.0 million, or 6%, to $124.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $132.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Volumes decreased 30,776 tons, or 1%, to 2.4 million tons in 2014 compared to 2.5 million tons in 2013. The average selling priced decreased 5% as a result of no longer pre-paying and adding freight to our invoices for a customer in our glass-end market.\nSegment Contribution Margin\nContribution margin in the Proppant Solutions segment increased $134.4 million, or 45%, to $430.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $296.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was driven by the increase in sales volume for resin-coated proppants, and the increase in volume for raw frac sand noted above.\nContribution margin in the I&R Products segment was relatively flat, decreasing $0.3 million, or 1%, to $34.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $34.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses increased $32.3 million, or 39%, to $114.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $81.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. SG&A attributable to our segments increased $4.9 million due to increased sales and marketing costs for our Proppant Solutions segment (included in Segment Contribution Margin noted above). Corporate SG&A costs increased $27.0 million primarily due to $9.2 million of IPO costs, increased costs associated with our incentive bonus plans, increased costs associated with implementing logistics planning tools, and other increased corporate costs to support the growth of our business, partially offset by non-recurring business development costs associated with our acquisition activity in 2013.\nDepreciation, Depletion, and Amortization\nDepreciation, depletion, and amortization increased $21.6 million, or 57%, to $59.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $37.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 due to the increase in fixed and intangible assets arising from the FTSI transaction and capital expenditures primarily due to increased production and logistics capacities.\nIncome from Operations\nIncome from operations increased $83.6 million, or 37%, to $311.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $228.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily as a result of increased gross margins, partially offset by increased selling, general, and administrative expenses, both described above.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased $1.1 million, or 2%, to $60.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $61.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Additional interest expense from additional borrowings to finance the Great Plains and FTSI transactions was offset by an increase in interest capitalized on construction projects in 2014.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes increased $32.2 million, or 71%, to $77.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $45.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Income before income\ntaxes increased $98.1 million or 65% to $248.0 million in 2014 compared to $149.9 million in 2013. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2014 was 31.2% compared to 30.2% for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a reduction in the impact of the depletion deduction due to the high growth of our resin-coated business and a reduction in the amount of the manufacturers' deduction due to lower taxable income resulting from the exercise of stock options in 2014.\nNet Income\nNet income increased $65.7 million, or 63%, to $170.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $104.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 due to the factors noted above.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $104.7 million, or 36%, to $397.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $292.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, due primarily to an increase in segment contribution margin.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur principal liquidity requirements historically have been to service our debt, to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs, to finance acquisitions and to occasionally pay dividends to our stockholders. We have met our liquidity and capital investment needs with funds generated through operations and through incremental borrowings. We also have the ability to raise capital through the issuance of shares of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding term loan borrowing of $1.24 billion. A term loan payment in the amount of $156.1 million is due in March 2017. As of the date of this report, we believe that our cash on hand and cash generated through operations will be sufficient to meet cash obligations, such as working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures, and scheduled debt payments, over the next twelve months. In addition, we have a revolving credit facility that can provide additional liquidity, if needed. As of December 31, 2015 we had $31.25 million of availability under our revolving credit facility with $11.5 million committed to letters of credit, leaving net availability at $19.7 million. See \u201cCredit Facilities\u201d below for more information regarding our Revolving Credit Facility.\nA continued sustained downturn in our business's key markets could significantly impact our forecasts. While we believe that our operations forecasts are reasonable, the forecasts are based on assumptions, and market conditions impacting the industry, primarily the proppant business, are uncertain. In the event the operating results are significantly worse than projected or we are unsuccessful in generating sufficient liquidity, we may not be able to satisfy our debt obligations and would be forced to restructure these obligations. In order to address this risk, we are implementing reductions in operating costs, selling, general, and administrative costs, reduced planned capital spending, working capital improvements, and permitted asset sales.\nWorking Capital\nWorking capital is the amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities and is a measure of our ability to pay our liabilities as they become due. Our working capital was $274.0 million and $318.7 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The following table presents the components of our working capital as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively:\nTable 164: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Current assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>171,486 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>76,923 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accounts receivable, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>73,566 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>206,094 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Inventories\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70,494 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>131,613 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,158 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Prepaid expenses and other assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,910 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,766 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Current assets classified as held-for-sale (includes cash, accounts receivable, inventories, and property, plant, and equipment)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,218 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total current assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>359,674 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>460,554 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Current liabilities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Current portion of long-term debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,536 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,274 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accounts payable\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,421 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>88,542 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accrued expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,785 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,025 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Current liabilities directly related to current assets classified as held-for-sale (includes accounts payable and accrued expenses)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>934 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total current liabilities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>85,676 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>141,841 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net working capital\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>273,998 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>318,713 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Accounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable decreased $132.5 million to $73.6 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $206.1 million at December 31, 2014. The decrease relates to the collection of higher 2014 receivables and a decline in the balance driven from the decline in sales volumes and selling prices during 2015.\nInventory\nInventory consists of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods at plants and terminals. The cost of finished goods includes processing costs and transportation costs to terminals. The decrease in inventory to $70.5 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $131.6 million at December 31, 2014 relates to lower sales and is also due to efforts to decrease inventory levels to match projected decreasing demand, particularly for resin-coated products.\nPrepaid Expenses and Other Assets\nPrepaid expenses and other assets decreased $0.9 million to $39.9 million at December 31, 2015 from $40.8 million at December 31, 2014, primarily due to the collection of refundable income taxes in 2015.\nAccounts Payable\nAccounts payable decreased $48.1 million to $40.4 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $88.5 million at December 31, 2014. The decrease in accounts payable is due to reduced purchasing activity driven by lower sales volumes.\nAccrued Expenses\nThe decrease in accrued expenses to $26.8 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $36.0 million at December 31, 2014 was primarily due to the payout of accrued bonuses related to the year ended December 31, 2014, reduced incentive and pension contribution costs in 2015, and a reduction in accrued taxes from the tax benefit position in 2015.\nCash Flow Analysis\nTable 165: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(amounts in millions) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>236.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>205.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>174.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(114.0 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(138.3 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(579.5 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(25.1 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.7 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>410.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities consist primarily of net income adjusted for non-cash items, including depreciation, depletion, and amortization and the effect of changes in working capital.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $236.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $205.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. This $30.7 million increase was primarily the result of changes in working capital, particularly a decrease in receivables and inventory.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $205.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $174.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2013. This $30.7 million increase was primarily the result of a $65.3 million increase in net income, partially offset by an increase in working capital for 2014 compared to 2013.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nInvesting activities consist primarily of capital expenditures for growth and maintenance, and in certain periods, investments to acquire strategic assets or businesses. Growth capital expenditures generally are for expansions of production or terminal capacities or new greenfield development of production capacity. Maintenance capital expenditures generally are for asset replacement and health, safety and quality improvements.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $114.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $138.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The $24.3 million decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in capital expenditures as declining volumes of sand sold in the oil and gas markets have reduced the rate at which we needed to expand production capacity.\nCapital expenditures of $113.8 million, including stripping costs, in the year ended December 31, 2015 were primarily focused on expansion of our sand processing capacities at our Wedron facility. Capital expenditures of $143.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 were associated with the expansion of our terminal\ninfrastructure, enhancing our unit train capabilities, and expansion of Propel SSP coating capacities. We believe that cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our anticipated capital expenditures in 2016, but financial results below our expectations could limit our ability to fund these expenditures.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $138.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $579.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. In the year ended December 31, 2013, $468.0 million was used for the acquisition of sand reserves and processing capacity in Minnesota (Great Plains), the acquisition of the rights to Propel SSP technology, and the acquisition of the proppant assets of FTSI. Capital expenditures increased $32.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.\nCapital expenditures were $143.5 million for 2014 and were primarily focused on continued development of self-suspending proppant (\u201cSSP\u201d) production facilities, construction of distribution terminals, continued expansion of rail logistics, and expansion of our sand processing capacities.\nNet Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities\nFinancing activities consist primarily of repayments under our Term Loans, capital leases, and other long-term debt reductions.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $25.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $7.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due payments on our Term Loans and capital leases, the decreases in tax benefits compared to the prior year for the exercise of stock options in the October 2014 Initial Public Offering, and refinancing fees in the current year associated with the extension of our B-1 Term Loan and amendment of our Revolving Credit Facility. We made payments of approximately $6.0 million against capital lease obligations.\nIn order to improve liquidity, we borrowed $41.0 million under our term loans in February 2014 to repay a similar amount outstanding under our revolving credit facility. In May 2015, we paid fees to extend the maturity dates of $161.5 million of our Term B-1 Loan from March 2017 to September 2019 to further improve near-term liquidity. In September 2015, we amended the terms of our Revolving Credit Facility. Please see further detail of our credit facilities in the \u201cCredit Facilities\u201d section below.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $7.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $410.5 million, which primarily related to borrowings used to acquire Great Plains and the FTSI assets. We also made payments of approximately $3.9 million against capital lease obligations in 2014.\nCredit Facilities\nOn September 5, 2013, we entered into the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (our \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d). Our Credit Agreement contains a revolving credit facility (\u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d) and two tranches of term loans (\u201cTerm B-1 Loans\u201d and \u201cTerm B-2 Loans\u201d). The Revolving Credit Facility and the Term B-1 and B-2 Loans are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our domestic assets.\nIn February 2014, we executed a joinder agreement to borrow $41 million in aggregate principal amount of additional Term B-2 Loans, bringing the total outstanding Term B-2 loans to $923.8 million. The proceeds of this borrowing were used to repay then outstanding amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nInitially, the Term B-1 Loans matured on March 15, 2017 and required quarterly principal repayments of $0.8 million (1% annually) with the balance due at maturity. The Term B-2 Loans mature on September 5, 2019 and require quarterly principal repayments of $2.2 million (1% annually) with the balance due at maturity. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility mature on September 5, 2018. In April and May 2015, we\nextended the maturity of $46.0 million and $115.5 million, respectively, of Term B-1 Loans (\u201cExtended Loans\u201d) until September 2019 (the same date as our Term B-2 Loans). The Extended Term B-1 Loans effectively were converted to Term B-2 Loans, and are treated as Term B-2 Loans, under the Credit Agreement for all purposes (including pricing), except for certain minor administrative differences and except that, prior to the Stated B-1 Maturity Date, the Extended Loans shall continue to amortize as Term B-1 Loans. Upon giving effect to the April 2015 and May 2015 Amendments, the maturity date of approximately $161.5 million in principal amount of outstanding Term B-1 Loans was extended, leaving approximately $156.6 million in principal amount of outstanding Term B-1 Loans (not including Extended Loans) maturing on the March 15, 2017. We paid fees of approximately $4.0 million to the lenders as a consent fee for the April and May 2015 Amendments.\nIn March 2014, we amended our Credit Agreement to reduce the applicable margin for Term B-1 and B-2 Base Rate loans to 2.50% and for Term B-1 and B-2 Eurodollar Rate loans to 3.50%. The Base Rate is the greater of prime rate, federal funds rate (subject to a 1.0% floor) plus 0.5%, 2%, or one-month LIBOR plus 1.0%. The adjusted Eurodollar Rate is subject to a 1.0% floor. With respect to borrowings under the Term B-1 Loans and Revolving Credit Facility, the 2% minimum for Base Rate borrowings and 1% for Eurodollar Rate borrowings did not apply. The applicable margin on the loans will be reduced by 0.25% if our leverage ratio falls below 2.75. As of December 31, 2015, Term B-1 Loans, Term B-2 Loans, Extended Term Loans and the borrowings under Revolving Credit Facility bore interest at 4.1%, 4.5%, 4.5% and 4.3%, respectively.\nThe terms of our Credit Agreement provide for customary representations and warranties and affirmative covenants. The Revolving Credit Facility also contains customary negative covenants setting forth limitations on further indebtedness, liens, investments, disposition of assets, acquisitions, junior payments and restrictions on subsidiary distributions.\nOur Revolving Credit Facility was increased from $75 million to $125 million after executing joinder agreements in August 2014 and September 2014, both of which increased the capacity of the Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2015, we entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement that modified the terms surrounding the Revolving Credit Facility. These modifications consisted primarily of (i) a reduction in the U.S. revolving commitments from $124 million to $99 million (while the aggregate Canadian revolving commitment remained at $1 million) and (ii) changes in the financial covenant governing the availability of amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility if, and only if, we have drawn, including letters of credit, more than $31.25 million on the Revolving Credit Facility. Generally, if our leverage ratio is greater than 4.75:1.00 during the period from the effective date of the Revolving Credit Facility amendment in the third quarter of 2015 through the fourth quarter of 2016, so long as the stated quarterly adjusted EBITDA thresholds are exceeded, the amount available to borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility is increased from $31.25 million to $40 million. Commencing with the end of the first quarter of 2017, the quarterly adjusted EBITDA thresholds are discontinued and the full amount of the revolving commitment ($100 million) is available so long as our quarterly leverage ratio does not exceed a revised limit (6.50:1.00 for the first quarter of 2017 declining to 4.75:1.00 for the fourth quarter of 2017). As of December 31, 2015, our leverage ratio was 8.96.\nAs of December 31, 2015, there were no borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility. However, there were $11.5 million of letters of credit outstanding, reducing the amount available to borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility to $19.72 million. We believe that the amount available under the Revolving Credit Facility, along with cash generated from operations and our substantial cash balance at December 31, 2015, provide adequate liquidity to allow us to meet our cash obligations over the next twelve months.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2015, we have contractual obligations for long-term debt, capital leases, operating leases, purchase obligations, and other long-term liabilities. The purchase obligations include approximately 3,000 railcars with future delivery dates in 2017 and 2018. We intend to satisfy these purchase obligations through leasing arrangements with third-party lessors. Substantially all of the operating lease obligations are for railcars.\nTable 166: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments Due by Period </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than 1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 Years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 Years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More than 5 Years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,228,515 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,525 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>176,387 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,029,565 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,038 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,651 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,253 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,219 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>179 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>266,509 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65,551 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>99,687 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47,143 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54,128 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>181,968 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>181,968 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other long-term liabilities reflected on the registrant's balance sheet under GAAP; deferred income taxes and other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>123,371 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>119,082 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,289 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,810,014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>83,329 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>581,343 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,076,887 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>68,455 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Environmental Matters\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing, among other things, hazardous materials, air and water emissions, environmental contamination and reclamation and the protection of the environment and natural resources. We have made, and expect to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the full amount of such future expenditures. We may also incur fines and penalties from time to time associated with noncompliance with such laws and regulations.\nIn 2015, we recorded an additional $1.1 million in future reclamation costs associated with a closed facility. There have been no other significant changes to environmental liabilities or future reclamation costs since December 31, 2014.\nWe discuss certain environmental matters relating to our various production and other facilities, certain regulatory requirements relating to human exposure to crystalline silica and our mining activity and how such matters may affect our business in the future under \u201cRegulation and Legislation\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and base our estimates on historical experience, current conditions and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Our actual results may materially differ from these estimates. These critical accounting policies and estimates should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements as filed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nListed below are the accounting policies we believe are critical to our financial statements due to the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved, and that we believe are critical to the understanding of our operations.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe periodically evaluate whether current events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, mineral reserves or mineral rights, goodwill, trade names and customer relationships, may not be recoverable. If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of future cash flows produced by the long-lived assets, or the appropriate grouping of assets, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available. If quoted market prices are not available, the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques, including a discounted value of estimated future cash flows. A detailed determination of the fair value may be carried forward from one year to the next if certain criteria have been met. We report an asset to be disposed of at the lower of its carrying value or its estimated net realizable value.\nFactors we generally consider important in our evaluation and that could trigger an impairment review of the carrying value of long-lived assets include expected operating trends, significant changes in the way assets are used, underutilization of our tangible assets, discontinuance of certain products by us or by our customers, and significant negative industry or economic trends.\nThe recoverability of the carrying value of our development stage mineral properties is dependent upon the successful development, start-up and commercial production of our mineral deposits and related processing facilities. Our evaluation of mineral properties for potential impairment primarily includes assessing the existence or availability of required permits and evaluating changes in our mineral reserves, or the underlying estimates and assumptions, including estimated production costs. Assessing the economic feasibility requires certain estimates, including the prices of products to be produced and processing recovery rates, as well as operating and capital costs.\nWe review definite-lived intangible assets, such as our supply agreements and acquired technology, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a definite-lived intangible asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. In cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the assets or asset groups.\nThe evaluation of goodwill or other intangible assets for possible impairment includes estimating fair value using one or a combination of valuation techniques, such as discounted cash flows or based on comparable companies or transactions. These valuations require us to make estimates and assumptions regarding future operating results, cash flows, changes in working capital and capital expenditures, selling prices, profitability, and the cost of capital. These judgments are particularly difficult given the recent industry environment, although we believe its assumptions and estimates are reasonable, deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce a materially different result.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nTrade accounts receivable are recognized at their invoiced amounts and do not bear interest. Credit is extended based on evaluation of a customer's financial condition and, generally, collateral is not required. Accounts receivable are generally due within 30 days, and are stated at amounts due from customers net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. Accounts outstanding longer than the payment terms are considered past due. We determine our allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time trade accounts\nreceivable are past due, our previous loss history, the customer's current ability to pay its obligation to us, and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole. Given the present industry environment in the oil and gas solutions segment, we may not have adequate warning of a potential credit and collection issue, and deviations from these estimates could produce additional credit losses. Ongoing credit evaluations are performed. We write-off accounts receivable when they are deemed uncollectible, and payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to the allowance for doubtful accounts.\nEquity Awards\nWe recognize stock based compensation expense using a fair value method. Fair value methods use a valuation model to theoretically value stock option grants even though they are not available for trading and are of longer duration. The Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model that we use includes the input of certain variables that are dependent on future expectations, including the expected lives of our options from grant date to exercise date, the volatility of a peer group of companies underlying common shares, and our expected dividend rate of zero. Our estimates of these variables are made for the purpose of using the valuation model to determine an expense for each reporting period and are not subsequently adjusted. We also estimate a forfeiture rate based on our historical experience, which could change over time. We value our restricted stock units at the closing price of our stock as of the date of issuance.\nFair Value of Derivatives\nWe record derivative instruments used to hedge interest rate exposure on the variable-rate debt obligations at their fair values. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or in other comprehensive income, depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedging relationship and, if it is, depending on the type of hedging relationship. For cash flow hedges in which we are hedging the variability of cash flows related to a variable-rate liability, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported in other comprehensive income in the periods during which earnings are impacted by the variability of the cash flows of the hedged item. The ineffective portion of all hedges is recognized in current period earnings. As interest expense is accrued on the debt obligation, amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to the interest rate swaps are reclassified into income to obtain a net cost on the debt obligation equal to the effective yield of the fixed rate of each swap. In the event that an interest rate swap is terminated prior to maturity, gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) remain deferred and are reclassified into earnings in the periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.\nThe fair values and effectiveness testing of our derivatives are based on prevailing market data and derived from proprietary models based on well recognized financial principles and reasonable estimates about relevant future market conditions including interest rates, counterparty risk, and credit risk. These assumptions could cause material changes in the fair value or effectiveness of our derivative instruments.\nTaxes\nDeferred taxes are provided on the liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. This approach requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based upon the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the expenses are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nWe recognize a tax benefit associated with an uncertain tax position when, in our judgment, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority. For a tax position that meets\nthe more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we initially and subsequently measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. The liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, case law developments and new or emerging legislation. Such adjustments are recognized entirely in the period in which they are identified. The effective tax rate includes the net impact of changes in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and subsequent adjustments as considered appropriate by management.\nWe evaluate quarterly the realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing the need for a valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are our forecast of future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction to utilize the asset, and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income might affect the ultimate realization of the net deferred tax assets. Factors that may affect our ability to achieve sufficient forecasted taxable income include, but are not limited to, the following: a decline in sales or margins, increased competition or loss of market share.\nIn addition, we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended time to resolve. We believe that adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years.\nThe largest permanent items in computing both our effective rate and taxable income are the deduction for statutory depletion and the manufacturers' deduction for manufacturers' products. The depletion deduction is dependent upon a mine-by-mine computation of both gross income from mining and taxable income.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting the consolidated operating results, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows of our company as of and for the periods presented below. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our description of the business in Item 1, \u201cBusiness\u201d in this report, and our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs of our management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in or implied by forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed herein, particularly in the section entitled \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nAs of December 31, 2015, we are one of the world's largest providers of sand-based proppant solutions and for nearly 40 years have been a pioneer in the development of high performance proppants used by Exploration & Production (\u201cE&P\u201d) companies to enhance the productivity of their oil and gas wells. We offer the broadest range of proppants available in the market today, including high quality sand and a variety of resin-coated products. All of our frac sand exceeds API specifications. Additionally, for more than 120 years, we and our predecessor companies have provided high quality sand-based products, strong technical leadership and applications knowledge to end users in the Industrial & Recreational (\u201cI&R\u201d) markets.\nAs one of the industry leaders, our asset base includes 798 million tons of proven and probable mineral reserves, which we believe is one of the largest reserve bases in the industry. Due to the continuing challenging conditions in the oil and gas markets, we continue to adjust our operational footprint to minimize our costs. As of March 2016, we have 11 sand processing facilities (7 of which are active) with 14.8 million tons of annual sand processing capacity. In 2015, we closed our sand processing facilities in Readfield, Wisconsin and Wexford, Michigan and idled our facilities in Brewer, Missouri, Shakopee, Minnesota, and Hager City, Wisconsin. We also have 10 coating facilities (6 of which are active) with 2.3 million tons of annual coating capacity. Our coating facilities include operations in Mexico, Denmark and China, through which we serve international oil and gas markets. In 2015, we closed our resin-coating facility in Bridgman, Michigan and idled resin-coating facilities in Voca, Texas and Cutler, Illinois and SSP-coating facilities in Fresno, Texas.\nWe are capable of Class I railroad deliveries to each of North America's major oil and gas producing basins and also have the flexibility to ship our product via barge, marine terminals and trucks to reach our customers as needed. We operate an integrated logistics platform consisting of 43 active proppant distribution terminals and a fleet of approximately 10,100 railcars (net of subleases). We have recently expanded our unit train destinations to two production facilities and seven in-basin terminals, which reduce freight costs and improve cycle times for our rail car fleet. In order to better align our logistics network with customer demand and to reduce costs, we discontinued activity at ten transloading terminals and opened seven new terminals in 2015.\nOur operations are organized into two segments based on the primary end markets we serve: (i) Proppant Solutions and (ii) Industrial & Recreational (I&R) Products. Our Proppant Solutions segment predominantly provides sand-based proppants for use in hydraulic fracturing operations throughout the U.S. and Canada, Argentina, Mexico, China, northern Europe and the United Arab Emirates. Our I&R segment provides raw, coated, and custom blended sands to the foundry, building products, glass, turf and landscape and filtration industries primarily in North America. We believe our two market segments are complementary. Our ability to sell to a wide range of customers across multiple end markets allows us to maximize the recovery of our reserve base within our mining operations and to reduce the cyclicality of our earnings.\nRecent Trends and Outlook\nRecent trends driving demand for our proppants and commercial silica include:\n \u2022 Level of drilling activity and demand for proppants. Through 2014, the growth in the use of horizontal drilling utilizing hydraulic fracturing as a means to extract hydrocarbons from shale formations dramatically increased the number of oil and gas rigs operating in North America. This increased drilling activity contributed to substantial growth in demand for proppants from 2009 to 2014. However, during the fourth quarter of 2014, increasing global supply of oil, in conjunction with slowing growth of global oil demand, created downward pressure on crude oil prices, which has continued through 2015. As a result, various E&P companies reduced drilling and capital programs, resulting in significantly reduced rig counts. North American rig counts have fallen significantly from September 2014 to December 2015, which has resulted in reduced drilling activity and has negatively impacted the demand for proppants in 2015. During the same period, however, E&P companies, in partnership with oilfield service companies, are continuing to refine their well designs and hydraulic fracturing techniques to maximize hydrocarbon recovery from each well. These techniques vary based on formation and well geology, but some of the more pervasive recent trends include longer lateral drilling lengths coupled with an increased number of hydraulic fracturing stages per well. E&P and oilfield service companies have also been increasing the amount of proppant used per frac stage and, together, these techniques have greatly increased the volume of proppant used in the completion of each well (referred to as \u201cproppant intensity\u201d). The trend of increasing proppant intensity has offset, to some extent, the decrease in demand for proppants resulting from reduced rig counts and drilling activity. \n \u2022 Shift in drilling activity and demand mix. The level of drilling activity for oil and gas can have an impact on the demand for proppant and the mix of proppant we sell. In 2014, with the rapid growth of drilling deep wells in regions such as the Permian region, and drilling wells in regions that were prone to the flowback of proppant, we saw a rapid increase in demand for our resin-coated proppants. In late 2014 and 2015, lower crude oil prices have caused E&P companies to seek ways to reduce short-term operating costs, and, as a result, we have seen reduced demand for our resin-coated proppants. Further, lower crude oil prices have caused many operators to drill fewer of the deeper and more expensive wells in an effort to reduce production costs, which has also had an adverse impact on the demand for resin-coated proppants, particularly those designed to add strength for higher closer pressures. There can be ongoing shifts in grade sizes that impact the demand for our raw sand proppants. \n \u2022 Volatility in selling prices for proppants. The rapid growth in demand for proppants in 2014 driven by relatively high oil and gas prices and high levels of drilling activity caused selling prices for proppants to increase as the market for proppants was generally undersupplied. This imbalance of supply and demand caused many proppant suppliers to expand production capacity in anticipation of continued growth in demand. However, the rapid decline in oil and gas prices that occurred later in 2014 and in 2015 led to reduced drilling activity and reduced demand for proppants. As a result, the proppant market is in a position of oversupply, which has caused selling prices for all proppants to decline significantly in 2015. It is unclear when global oil and gas prices and increased drilling activity will begin to increase the demand for proppants, or when industry production capacity will contract enough to bring supply and demand more into balance and put upward pressure on selling prices. \n \u2022 Demand for in-basin delivery of proppant. In recent years, many customers sought to outsource proppant logistics and to purchase proppant at the basin, allowing them to focus on their core competencies, minimize inventory costs, and maximize flexibility. In 2015, approximately 75% of our proppant sales volume was sold in-basin, down from approximately 85% in 2014. In the second half of 2015, we saw an increase in demand from larger oilfield service customers for large volume shipments that can be taken directly from our plants. With our increasing capability to provide low-cost unit train shipments directly to large customers while also shipping unit trains to certain of our own in-basin terminals, we are well-equipped to take advantage of shifting demand. \n \u2022 Increased demand for unit train deliveries. With the shift of larger oilfield services customers toward shipments taken directly from our plants, there is also a greater demand for shipments via unit trains to \n enhance the economics of deliveries. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we shipped 68 unit trains representing approximately 74% of Northern White sand volumes with a total of 208 unit trains shipped during the year. We are well-positioned to help our customers lower their costs and improve delivery, as we now have seven unit train-capable destinations. \n \u2022 Continued stable demand in industrial end markets. Sales in our I&R Products segment are driven by macroeconomic factors such as housing starts, light vehicle sales, repair and remodel activity and industrial production. To the extent these demand drivers continue on their current trends, we expect that demand for our commercial silica products will remain relatively stable. \nHow We Generate Our Sales\nWe derive our sales by mining, processing and transporting sand-based proppants and silica sand products that our customers purchase for use in a wide variety of applications. In our Proppant Solutions business for the year ended December 31, 2015, we sold approximately 75% of our North American proppant volume through our network of terminals at selling prices that are set by local market dynamics. The remaining volume in the Proppant Solutions business is sold to customers directly from our mining and production facilities. The average selling prices for products sold through our terminals are higher than the average selling prices for comparable products sold from our production facilities due to costs incurred to handle and transport the products from the production facilities to the terminals. Generally, logistics costs can comprise 70-80% of the delivered cost of Northern White frac sand, depending on the basin into which the product is delivered. Due to the closer proximity of distribution terminals to our production facility, the amount of logistics costs included in the total delivered cost of our Texas Gold frac sand generally will be lower than that for our Northern White frac sand.\nWe primarily sell products under supply agreements with terms that vary by contract. Generally, the selling prices specified in our contracts are based on market prices. We believe that this approach to contract pricing allows us to reduce prices and retain or gain volume in market downcycles and capture higher prices in market upcycles. Our contracts have a variety of volume provisions. While certain of our contracts have no minimum volume requirements, certain of the agreements require the customer to purchase a specified percentage of its proppant requirements or a minimum volume of proppant from us. Certain of these minimum volume contracts include a provision which may trigger penalties if the purchased volume does not meet the required minimums.\nOur Proppant Solutions segment represented 86% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015. A large portion of our sales is generated by our top customers, and the loss of, or significant reduction in, purchases by our largest customers could adversely affect our operations. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our top ten proppant customers collectively represented 70% and 66% of our revenues, respectively. During the same periods, sales in the aggregate to our top two customers, Halliburton Company (\u201cHalliburton\u201d) and FTS International Services, LLC (\u201cFTSI\u201d), collectively accounted for 43% and 36% of our revenues, respectively.\nOur I&R business segment has over 770 customers and represented 14% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015. In our I&R business, we use our network of I&R distribution terminals to sell products from our production facilities to distributors which sell the product to the end user.\nThe Costs of Conducting Our Business\nThe principal costs involved in operating our business are logistics costs associated with transporting products from our production facilities to our terminals; payroll costs for personnel at our production, terminal and administrative facilities; resin and other raw materials and supplies used in the production of our products; and maintenance and repair costs at our production facilities. We own or lease most of our sand reserves, the combination of which, we believe, helps us maintain a very competitive cost position.\nLogistics costs, including freight, railcar leases, demurrage and handling, represented approximately 37% and 33% of our revenues during the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Freight costs primarily represent charges to transport our product by rail, but we also ship product by truck and barge. In order to move product by rail, we lease a substantial number of railcars under operating leases with durations ranging from three to seven years. We currently have approximately 8,900 railcars under lease and 1,200 railcars made available to us from our customers, giving us a total fleet of approximately 10,100 railcars (net of 200 cars currently subleased). Demurrage costs are charged by the railroads based on the time a railcar spends on the rail in excess of the allotted time. These costs can vary significantly from period to period driven by high levels of rail activity at a terminal and changes in the timing of fulfilling customer orders. Handling costs are incurred at our distribution and terminal facilities to move product from one mode of transportation to another (e.g., truck to railcar) and to move product into storage facilities. Storage costs are incurred when railcars are temporarily taken out of service and stored at a rail yard or storage facility.\nLabor costs, including wages and benefits, represented approximately 13% and 10% of revenues during the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Approximately 16% of our workforce was party to collective bargaining contracts as of December 31, 2015.\nWe use a significant amount of resins and additives in the production of our coated products in both our Proppant Solutions and I&R businesses. We purchase these resins under supply agreements that contain annual pricing adjustments based on the cost of phenol, the primary component of the resins we buy. We also supply a portion of our resin requirements from our resin manufacturing facility located in Michigan. The cost of resins and additives represented approximately 8% and 11% of revenues during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nOur selling, general and administrative costs, which include the wages and benefits costs noted above, represented approximately 10% and 8% of revenues during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These costs are related to our corporate operations, including costs for the sales and marketing; research and development; finance; legal; and environmental, health and safety functions of our organization. Since becoming a public company, we incur additional legal, accounting, insurance and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. These requirements include compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as well as other rules implemented by the SEC, and applicable stock exchange rules.\nWe capitalize the costs of our mining and processing equipment and depreciate it over its expected useful life. We also capitalize the costs to remove overburden on our sand reserves for our surface mines and amortize them based on the actual tons mined. Depreciation, depletion, and amortization costs represented approximately 8% and 4% of revenues during the years ended December, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Repair and maintenance costs that do not involve the replacement of major components of our equipment and facilities are expensed as incurred. These repair and maintenance costs can be significant due to the abrasive nature of our products and represented approximately 3% and 2% of revenues during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nHow We Evaluate Our Business\nOur management uses a variety of financial and operational metrics to analyze our performance across our Proppant Solutions and I&R Products segments. This segmentation is based on the primary end markets we serve, our management structure and the financial information that is reviewed by the Chief Executive Officer in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. We evaluate the performance of these segments based on their volumes sold, average selling price and segment contribution margin. We do not evaluate the performance of the segments on a margin percentage basis, as that is a function of the channel in which a given product is sold (for example, in-basin sales generate higher selling price but comparable per ton margin, resulting in reduced margin percentage) and product mix. Additionally, we consider a number of factors in evaluating the\nperformance of the business as a whole, including total volumes sold and Adjusted EBITDA. We view these metrics as important factors in evaluating our profitability and review these measurements frequently to analyze trends and make decisions.\nSegment Contribution Margin\nSegment contribution margin is a key metric that management uses to evaluate our operating performance and to determine resource allocation between segments. Segment contribution margin is defined as total revenues less the cost of goods sold to produce and deliver the products, less selling, general and administrative expenses that are directly attributable to each segment. The definition excludes certain corporate costs not associated with the operations of the segment. These unallocated costs include costs related to corporate functional areas such as administration, accounting, information technology, human resources, research and development, business development and sustainable development.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures that are used by management and external users of our financial statements, such as lenders and rating agencies.\nWe define EBITDA as net income before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation, depletion and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before non-cash stock-based compensation, management fees and reimbursement of expenses to our financial sponsor, transaction expenses, impairment of assets, loss on extinguishment of debt, gain or loss on disposal of certain assets, and other non-cash or non-recurring income or expenses.\nManagement believes EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful because they allow us to more effectively evaluate our operating performance and compare the results of our operations from period to period without regard to our financing methods, capital structure or non-recurring or non-operating expenses. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered as alternatives to, or more meaningful than, net income or cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP as indicators of our operating performance or liquidity. Certain items excluded from EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company's financial performance, such as a company's cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are components of EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA. Although we attempt to determine EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in a manner that is consistent with other companies in our industry, our computations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are widely followed measures of operating performance and may also be used by investors to measure our ability to meet debt service requirements.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:\nTable 152: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

$527.8 million, or 39%, to $828.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $1,356.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, due to decreased volumes, pricing compression, and product mix primarily in the Proppant Solutions segment.\nRevenues in the Proppant Solutions segment decreased $522.1 million, or 42%, to $710.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $1,232.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Total volumes decreased 14% to 6.2 million tons in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2014. Raw frac sand volumes decreased slightly to 5.4 million tons in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 5.7 million tons in the year ended December 31, 2014. The average selling price for raw frac sand in 2015 decreased approximately 19% from 2014. Coated proppant volumes decreased 48% to 0.8 million tons in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 1.5 million tons in the year ended December 31, 2014. The average selling price for resin-coated proppants in 2015 decreased approximately 18% from 2014. The decrease in Proppant Solutions revenue was due to pricing declines, a shift in sales toward FOB plant shipments, and declines in resin-coated proppant volumes primarily in the second half of the year.\nRevenues in the I&R Products segment decreased $5.6 million, or 5%, to $118.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $124.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Volumes declined slight to 2.3 million tons in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2.4 million tons in the year ended December 31, 2014. I&R segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 was impacted by downward pressure in the U.S. foundry market as well as a shift in customer and product mix in the business.\nSegment Contribution Margin\nContribution margin in the Proppant Solutions segment decreased $360.0 million, or 84%, to $70.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $430.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in segment contribution margin was primarily driven by lower volumes, changes in product mix, decreased selling prices, higher operating costs per ton due to lower volumes over which to absorb fixed costs such as railcars and logistics, and non-recurring impairment and restructuring charges in the year ended December 31, 2015. The Proppant Solutions segment contribution margin includes non-recurring impairment and restructuring charges of $82.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nContribution margin in the I&R Products segment decreased $9.2 million, or 27%, to $25.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $34.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily driven by non-recurring restructuring charges associated with plant closures, such as impairment of property, plant, and equipment, and liabilities associated with pension withdrawal and land reclamation. The Industrial & Recreational Products segment contribution margin includes non-recurring impairment and restructuring charges of $13.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased $33.6 million, or 29%, to $80.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $114.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. SG&A attributable to our segments decreased $8.8 million. Corporate SG&A costs decreased $24.8 million primarily due to lower costs associated with incentive plans, pension contributions, and reduced workforce this year as well as non-recurring costs in the prior year associated with the October 2014 Initial Public Offering.\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization increased $7.4 million, or 12%, to $66.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $59.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in depreciation is due to more assets placed in service primarily related to the Wedron plant expansion.\nIncome (Loss) from Operations\nIncome (loss) from operations decreased $341.8 million, or 110%, to a loss of $30.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to income of $311.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Earnings in 2015 were largely impacted by non-recurring impairment and restructuring charges of $96.7 million as well as declines in contribution margins due to lower volumes and decreased selling prices.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $1.4 million, or 2%, to $62.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $60.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to interest rate swap agreements, entered into in 2013, that became effective October 2015.\nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes\nThe provision (benefit) for income taxes decreased $79.4 million, or 103%, to arrive at a benefit of $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to a provision of $77.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Income before income taxes decreased $341.9 million or 138% to a loss of $93.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to income of $248.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The primary items impacting the tax provision include an increase in the valuation allowance primarily related to U.S. alternative minimum tax credits and U.S. research credits; a goodwill impairment charge with no corresponding income tax benefit; and the accrual of deferred taxes on our accumulated foreign undistributed earnings resulting from a change in our indefinite reinvestment assertion. These unfavorable items were partially offset by a 9.7% effective income tax benefit related to depletion.\nNet Income (Loss)\nNet income (loss) decreased $262.6 million, or 154%, to a loss of $92.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to income of $170.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 due to the factors noted above.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased $259.2 million, or 65%, to $138.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $397.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decline in Adjusted EBITDA was largely due to declines in proppant pricing and volumes.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013\nRevenues\nRevenues increased $368.1 million, or 37%, to $1,356.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $988.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to increased raw and resin-coated frac sand volumes in our Proppant Solutions segment and, to a lesser extent, increases in the selling price of certain grades of raw frac sand during the year.\nRevenues in the Proppant Solutions segment increased $376.0 million, or 44%, to $1,232.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $856.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Total volumes increased 40% to 7.2 million tons in 2014 compared to 5.1 million tons in 2013. Raw frac sand volumes increased 1.6 million tons, or 40%, to 5.7 million tons compared to 4.1 million tons during this period. The average selling price for raw sand increased 7%, which was primarily the result of an increase in the proportion of raw sand sold through our terminal network and an increase in the selling price of certain grades of sand during the year, partially offset by a shift in volumes sold toward finer grades of raw sand (which generally carry lower selling prices than coarser grades) and increases in sales of Texas Gold brown sand since the acquisition of the Voca facility as part of the acquisition of the proppant assets from FTSI in September 2013. Coated proppant volumes increased 43% to 1.5 million tons in 2014 compared to 1.0 million tons in 2013. The average selling price for resin-coated proppants decreased 2%, which was primarily the result of customer mix and the full year impact of selling price declines taken in 2013, partially offset by a shift in volumes sold towards higher-priced products.\nRevenues in the I&R Products segment decreased $8.0 million, or 6%, to $124.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $132.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Volumes decreased 30,776 tons, or 1%, to 2.4 million tons in 2014 compared to 2.5 million tons in 2013. The average selling priced decreased 5% as a result of no longer pre-paying and adding freight to our invoices for a customer in our glass-end market.\nSegment Contribution Margin\nContribution margin in the Proppant Solutions segment increased $134.4 million, or 45%, to $430.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $296.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was driven by the increase in sales volume for resin-coated proppants, and the increase in volume for raw frac sand noted above.\nContribution margin in the I&R Products segment was relatively flat, decreasing $0.3 million, or 1%, to $34.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $34.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses increased $32.3 million, or 39%, to $114.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $81.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. SG&A attributable to our segments increased $4.9 million due to increased sales and marketing costs for our Proppant Solutions segment (included in Segment Contribution Margin noted above). Corporate SG&A costs increased $27.0 million primarily due to $9.2 million of IPO costs, increased costs associated with our incentive bonus plans, increased costs associated with implementing logistics planning tools, and other increased corporate costs to support the growth of our business, partially offset by non-recurring business development costs associated with our acquisition activity in 2013.\nDepreciation, Depletion, and Amortization\nDepreciation, depletion, and amortization increased $21.6 million, or 57%, to $59.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $37.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 due to the increase in fixed and intangible assets arising from the FTSI transaction and capital expenditures primarily due to increased production and logistics capacities.\nIncome from Operations\nIncome from operations increased $83.6 million, or 37%, to $311.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $228.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily as a result of increased gross margins, partially offset by increased selling, general, and administrative expenses, both described above.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased $1.1 million, or 2%, to $60.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $61.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Additional interest expense from additional borrowings to finance the Great Plains and FTSI transactions was offset by an increase in interest capitalized on construction projects in 2014.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes increased $32.2 million, or 71%, to $77.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $45.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Income before income\ntaxes increased $98.1 million or 65% to $248.0 million in 2014 compared to $149.9 million in 2013. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2014 was 31.2% compared to 30.2% for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a reduction in the impact of the depletion deduction due to the high growth of our resin-coated business and a reduction in the amount of the manufacturers' deduction due to lower taxable income resulting from the exercise of stock options in 2014.\nNet Income\nNet income increased $65.7 million, or 63%, to $170.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $104.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 due to the factors noted above.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $104.7 million, or 36%, to $397.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $292.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, due primarily to an increase in segment contribution margin.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur principal liquidity requirements historically have been to service our debt, to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs, to finance acquisitions and to occasionally pay dividends to our stockholders. We have met our liquidity and capital investment needs with funds generated through operations and through incremental borrowings. We also have the ability to raise capital through the issuance of shares of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding term loan borrowing of $1.24 billion. A term loan payment in the amount of $156.1 million is due in March 2017. As of the date of this report, we believe that our cash on hand and cash generated through operations will be sufficient to meet cash obligations, such as working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures, and scheduled debt payments, over the next twelve months. In addition, we have a revolving credit facility that can provide additional liquidity, if needed. As of December 31, 2015 we had $31.25 million of availability under our revolving credit facility with $11.5 million committed to letters of credit, leaving net availability at $19.7 million. See \u201cCredit Facilities\u201d below for more information regarding our Revolving Credit Facility.\nA continued sustained downturn in our business's key markets could significantly impact our forecasts. While we believe that our operations forecasts are reasonable, the forecasts are based on assumptions, and market conditions impacting the industry, primarily the proppant business, are uncertain. In the event the operating results are significantly worse than projected or we are unsuccessful in generating sufficient liquidity, we may not be able to satisfy our debt obligations and would be forced to restructure these obligations. In order to address this risk, we are implementing reductions in operating costs, selling, general, and administrative costs, reduced planned capital spending, working capital improvements, and permitted asset sales.\nWorking Capital\nWorking capital is the amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities and is a measure of our ability to pay our liabilities as they become due. Our working capital was $274.0 million and $318.7 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The following table presents the components of our working capital as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively:\nTable 164: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Current assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>171,486 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>76,923 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accounts receivable, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>73,566 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>206,094 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Inventories\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70,494 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>131,613 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,158 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Prepaid expenses and other assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,910 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,766 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Current assets classified as held-for-sale (includes cash, accounts receivable, inventories, and property, plant, and equipment)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,218 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total current assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>359,674 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>460,554 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Current liabilities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Current portion of long-term debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,536 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,274 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accounts payable\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,421 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>88,542 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accrued expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,785 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,025 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Current liabilities directly related to current assets classified as held-for-sale (includes accounts payable and accrued expenses)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>934 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total current liabilities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>85,676 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>141,841 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net working capital\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>273,998 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>318,713 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Accounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable decreased $132.5 million to $73.6 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $206.1 million at December 31, 2014. The decrease relates to the collection of higher 2014 receivables and a decline in the balance driven from the decline in sales volumes and selling prices during 2015.\nInventory\nInventory consists of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods at plants and terminals. The cost of finished goods includes processing costs and transportation costs to terminals. The decrease in inventory to $70.5 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $131.6 million at December 31, 2014 relates to lower sales and is also due to efforts to decrease inventory levels to match projected decreasing demand, particularly for resin-coated products.\nPrepaid Expenses and Other Assets\nPrepaid expenses and other assets decreased $0.9 million to $39.9 million at December 31, 2015 from $40.8 million at December 31, 2014, primarily due to the collection of refundable income taxes in 2015.\nAccounts Payable\nAccounts payable decreased $48.1 million to $40.4 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $88.5 million at December 31, 2014. The decrease in accounts payable is due to reduced purchasing activity driven by lower sales volumes.\nAccrued Expenses\nThe decrease in accrued expenses to $26.8 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $36.0 million at December 31, 2014 was primarily due to the payout of accrued bonuses related to the year ended December 31, 2014, reduced incentive and pension contribution costs in 2015, and a reduction in accrued taxes from the tax benefit position in 2015.\nCash Flow Analysis\nTable 165: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(amounts in millions) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>236.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>205.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>174.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(114.0 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(138.3 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(579.5 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(25.1 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.7 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>410.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities consist primarily of net income adjusted for non-cash items, including depreciation, depletion, and amortization and the effect of changes in working capital.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $236.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $205.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. This $30.7 million increase was primarily the result of changes in working capital, particularly a decrease in receivables and inventory.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $205.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $174.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2013. This $30.7 million increase was primarily the result of a $65.3 million increase in net income, partially offset by an increase in working capital for 2014 compared to 2013.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nInvesting activities consist primarily of capital expenditures for growth and maintenance, and in certain periods, investments to acquire strategic assets or businesses. Growth capital expenditures generally are for expansions of production or terminal capacities or new greenfield development of production capacity. Maintenance capital expenditures generally are for asset replacement and health, safety and quality improvements.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $114.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $138.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The $24.3 million decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in capital expenditures as declining volumes of sand sold in the oil and gas markets have reduced the rate at which we needed to expand production capacity.\nCapital expenditures of $113.8 million, including stripping costs, in the year ended December 31, 2015 were primarily focused on expansion of our sand processing capacities at our Wedron facility. Capital expenditures of $143.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 were associated with the expansion of our terminal\ninfrastructure, enhancing our unit train capabilities, and expansion of Propel SSP coating capacities. We believe that cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our anticipated capital expenditures in 2016, but financial results below our expectations could limit our ability to fund these expenditures.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $138.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $579.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. In the year ended December 31, 2013, $468.0 million was used for the acquisition of sand reserves and processing capacity in Minnesota (Great Plains), the acquisition of the rights to Propel SSP technology, and the acquisition of the proppant assets of FTSI. Capital expenditures increased $32.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.\nCapital expenditures were $143.5 million for 2014 and were primarily focused on continued development of self-suspending proppant (\u201cSSP\u201d) production facilities, construction of distribution terminals, continued expansion of rail logistics, and expansion of our sand processing capacities.\nNet Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities\nFinancing activities consist primarily of repayments under our Term Loans, capital leases, and other long-term debt reductions.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $25.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $7.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due payments on our Term Loans and capital leases, the decreases in tax benefits compared to the prior year for the exercise of stock options in the October 2014 Initial Public Offering, and refinancing fees in the current year associated with the extension of our B-1 Term Loan and amendment of our Revolving Credit Facility. We made payments of approximately $6.0 million against capital lease obligations.\nIn order to improve liquidity, we borrowed $41.0 million under our term loans in February 2014 to repay a similar amount outstanding under our revolving credit facility. In May 2015, we paid fees to extend the maturity dates of $161.5 million of our Term B-1 Loan from March 2017 to September 2019 to further improve near-term liquidity. In September 2015, we amended the terms of our Revolving Credit Facility. Please see further detail of our credit facilities in the \u201cCredit Facilities\u201d section below.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $7.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $410.5 million, which primarily related to borrowings used to acquire Great Plains and the FTSI assets. We also made payments of approximately $3.9 million against capital lease obligations in 2014.\nCredit Facilities\nOn September 5, 2013, we entered into the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (our \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d). Our Credit Agreement contains a revolving credit facility (\u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d) and two tranches of term loans (\u201cTerm B-1 Loans\u201d and \u201cTerm B-2 Loans\u201d). The Revolving Credit Facility and the Term B-1 and B-2 Loans are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our domestic assets.\nIn February 2014, we executed a joinder agreement to borrow $41 million in aggregate principal amount of additional Term B-2 Loans, bringing the total outstanding Term B-2 loans to $923.8 million. The proceeds of this borrowing were used to repay then outstanding amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nInitially, the Term B-1 Loans matured on March 15, 2017 and required quarterly principal repayments of $0.8 million (1% annually) with the balance due at maturity. The Term B-2 Loans mature on September 5, 2019 and require quarterly principal repayments of $2.2 million (1% annually) with the balance due at maturity. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility mature on September 5, 2018. In April and May 2015, we\nextended the maturity of $46.0 million and $115.5 million, respectively, of Term B-1 Loans (\u201cExtended Loans\u201d) until September 2019 (the same date as our Term B-2 Loans). The Extended Term B-1 Loans effectively were converted to Term B-2 Loans, and are treated as Term B-2 Loans, under the Credit Agreement for all purposes (including pricing), except for certain minor administrative differences and except that, prior to the Stated B-1 Maturity Date, the Extended Loans shall continue to amortize as Term B-1 Loans. Upon giving effect to the April 2015 and May 2015 Amendments, the maturity date of approximately $161.5 million in principal amount of outstanding Term B-1 Loans was extended, leaving approximately $156.6 million in principal amount of outstanding Term B-1 Loans (not including Extended Loans) maturing on the March 15, 2017. We paid fees of approximately $4.0 million to the lenders as a consent fee for the April and May 2015 Amendments.\nIn March 2014, we amended our Credit Agreement to reduce the applicable margin for Term B-1 and B-2 Base Rate loans to 2.50% and for Term B-1 and B-2 Eurodollar Rate loans to 3.50%. The Base Rate is the greater of prime rate, federal funds rate (subject to a 1.0% floor) plus 0.5%, 2%, or one-month LIBOR plus 1.0%. The adjusted Eurodollar Rate is subject to a 1.0% floor. With respect to borrowings under the Term B-1 Loans and Revolving Credit Facility, the 2% minimum for Base Rate borrowings and 1% for Eurodollar Rate borrowings did not apply. The applicable margin on the loans will be reduced by 0.25% if our leverage ratio falls below 2.75. As of December 31, 2015, Term B-1 Loans, Term B-2 Loans, Extended Term Loans and the borrowings under Revolving Credit Facility bore interest at 4.1%, 4.5%, 4.5% and 4.3%, respectively.\nThe terms of our Credit Agreement provide for customary representations and warranties and affirmative covenants. The Revolving Credit Facility also contains customary negative covenants setting forth limitations on further indebtedness, liens, investments, disposition of assets, acquisitions, junior payments and restrictions on subsidiary distributions.\nOur Revolving Credit Facility was increased from $75 million to $125 million after executing joinder agreements in August 2014 and September 2014, both of which increased the capacity of the Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2015, we entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement that modified the terms surrounding the Revolving Credit Facility. These modifications consisted primarily of (i) a reduction in the U.S. revolving commitments from $124 million to $99 million (while the aggregate Canadian revolving commitment remained at $1 million) and (ii) changes in the financial covenant governing the availability of amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility if, and only if, we have drawn, including letters of credit, more than $31.25 million on the Revolving Credit Facility. Generally, if our leverage ratio is greater than 4.75:1.00 during the period from the effective date of the Revolving Credit Facility amendment in the third quarter of 2015 through the fourth quarter of 2016, so long as the stated quarterly adjusted EBITDA thresholds are exceeded, the amount available to borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility is increased from $31.25 million to $40 million. Commencing with the end of the first quarter of 2017, the quarterly adjusted EBITDA thresholds are discontinued and the full amount of the revolving commitment ($100 million) is available so long as our quarterly leverage ratio does not exceed a revised limit (6.50:1.00 for the first quarter of 2017 declining to 4.75:1.00 for the fourth quarter of 2017). As of December 31, 2015, our leverage ratio was 8.96.\nAs of December 31, 2015, there were no borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility. However, there were $11.5 million of letters of credit outstanding, reducing the amount available to borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility to $19.72 million. We believe that the amount available under the Revolving Credit Facility, along with cash generated from operations and our substantial cash balance at December 31, 2015, provide adequate liquidity to allow us to meet our cash obligations over the next twelve months.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2015, we have contractual obligations for long-term debt, capital leases, operating leases, purchase obligations, and other long-term liabilities. The purchase obligations include approximately 3,000 railcars with future delivery dates in 2017 and 2018. We intend to satisfy these purchase obligations through leasing arrangements with third-party lessors. Substantially all of the operating lease obligations are for railcars.\nTable 166: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments Due by Period </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than 1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 Years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 Years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More than 5 Years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,228,515 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,525 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>176,387 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,029,565 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,038 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,651 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,253 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,219 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>179 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>266,509 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65,551 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>99,687 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47,143 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54,128 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>181,968 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>181,968 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other long-term liabilities reflected on the registrant's balance sheet under GAAP; deferred income taxes and other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>123,371 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>119,082 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,289 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,810,014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>83,329 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>581,343 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,076,887 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>68,455 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Environmental Matters\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing, among other things, hazardous materials, air and water emissions, environmental contamination and reclamation and the protection of the environment and natural resources. We have made, and expect to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the full amount of such future expenditures. We may also incur fines and penalties from time to time associated with noncompliance with such laws and regulations.\nIn 2015, we recorded an additional $1.1 million in future reclamation costs associated with a closed facility. There have been no other significant changes to environmental liabilities or future reclamation costs since December 31, 2014.\nWe discuss certain environmental matters relating to our various production and other facilities, certain regulatory requirements relating to human exposure to crystalline silica and our mining activity and how such matters may affect our business in the future under \u201cRegulation and Legislation\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and base our estimates on historical experience, current conditions and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Our actual results may materially differ from these estimates. These critical accounting policies and estimates should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements as filed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nListed below are the accounting policies we believe are critical to our financial statements due to the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved, and that we believe are critical to the understanding of our operations.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe periodically evaluate whether current events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, mineral reserves or mineral rights, goodwill, trade names and customer relationships, may not be recoverable. If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of future cash flows produced by the long-lived assets, or the appropriate grouping of assets, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available. If quoted market prices are not available, the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques, including a discounted value of estimated future cash flows. A detailed determination of the fair value may be carried forward from one year to the next if certain criteria have been met. We report an asset to be disposed of at the lower of its carrying value or its estimated net realizable value.\nFactors we generally consider important in our evaluation and that could trigger an impairment review of the carrying value of long-lived assets include expected operating trends, significant changes in the way assets are used, underutilization of our tangible assets, discontinuance of certain products by us or by our customers, and significant negative industry or economic trends.\nThe recoverability of the carrying value of our development stage mineral properties is dependent upon the successful development, start-up and commercial production of our mineral deposits and related processing facilities. Our evaluation of mineral properties for potential impairment primarily includes assessing the existence or availability of required permits and evaluating changes in our mineral reserves, or the underlying estimates and assumptions, including estimated production costs. Assessing the economic feasibility requires certain estimates, including the prices of products to be produced and processing recovery rates, as well as operating and capital costs.\nWe review definite-lived intangible assets, such as our supply agreements and acquired technology, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a definite-lived intangible asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. In cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the assets or asset groups.\nThe evaluation of goodwill or other intangible assets for possible impairment includes estimating fair value using one or a combination of valuation techniques, such as discounted cash flows or based on comparable companies or transactions. These valuations require us to make estimates and assumptions regarding future operating results, cash flows, changes in working capital and capital expenditures, selling prices, profitability, and the cost of capital. These judgments are particularly difficult given the recent industry environment, although we believe its assumptions and estimates are reasonable, deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce a materially different result.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nTrade accounts receivable are recognized at their invoiced amounts and do not bear interest. Credit is extended based on evaluation of a customer's financial condition and, generally, collateral is not required. Accounts receivable are generally due within 30 days, and are stated at amounts due from customers net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. Accounts outstanding longer than the payment terms are considered past due. We determine our allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time trade accounts\nreceivable are past due, our previous loss history, the customer's current ability to pay its obligation to us, and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole. Given the present industry environment in the oil and gas solutions segment, we may not have adequate warning of a potential credit and collection issue, and deviations from these estimates could produce additional credit losses. Ongoing credit evaluations are performed. We write-off accounts receivable when they are deemed uncollectible, and payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to the allowance for doubtful accounts.\nEquity Awards\nWe recognize stock based compensation expense using a fair value method. Fair value methods use a valuation model to theoretically value stock option grants even though they are not available for trading and are of longer duration. The Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model that we use includes the input of certain variables that are dependent on future expectations, including the expected lives of our options from grant date to exercise date, the volatility of a peer group of companies underlying common shares, and our expected dividend rate of zero. Our estimates of these variables are made for the purpose of using the valuation model to determine an expense for each reporting period and are not subsequently adjusted. We also estimate a forfeiture rate based on our historical experience, which could change over time. We value our restricted stock units at the closing price of our stock as of the date of issuance.\nFair Value of Derivatives\nWe record derivative instruments used to hedge interest rate exposure on the variable-rate debt obligations at their fair values. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or in other comprehensive income, depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedging relationship and, if it is, depending on the type of hedging relationship. For cash flow hedges in which we are hedging the variability of cash flows related to a variable-rate liability, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported in other comprehensive income in the periods during which earnings are impacted by the variability of the cash flows of the hedged item. The ineffective portion of all hedges is recognized in current period earnings. As interest expense is accrued on the debt obligation, amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to the interest rate swaps are reclassified into income to obtain a net cost on the debt obligation equal to the effective yield of the fixed rate of each swap. In the event that an interest rate swap is terminated prior to maturity, gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) remain deferred and are reclassified into earnings in the periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.\nThe fair values and effectiveness testing of our derivatives are based on prevailing market data and derived from proprietary models based on well recognized financial principles and reasonable estimates about relevant future market conditions including interest rates, counterparty risk, and credit risk. These assumptions could cause material changes in the fair value or effectiveness of our derivative instruments.\nTaxes\nDeferred taxes are provided on the liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. This approach requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based upon the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the expenses are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nWe recognize a tax benefit associated with an uncertain tax position when, in our judgment, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority. For a tax position that meets\nthe more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we initially and subsequently measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. The liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, case law developments and new or emerging legislation. Such adjustments are recognized entirely in the period in which they are identified. The effective tax rate includes the net impact of changes in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and subsequent adjustments as considered appropriate by management.\nWe evaluate quarterly the realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing the need for a valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are our forecast of future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction to utilize the asset, and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income might affect the ultimate realization of the net deferred tax assets. Factors that may affect our ability to achieve sufficient forecasted taxable income include, but are not limited to, the following: a decline in sales or margins, increased competition or loss of market share.\nIn addition, we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended time to resolve. We believe that adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years.\nThe largest permanent items in computing both our effective rate and taxable income are the deduction for statutory depletion and the manufacturers' deduction for manufacturers' products. The depletion deduction is dependent upon a mine-by-mine computation of both gross income from mining and taxable income.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting the consolidated operating results, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows of our company as of and for the periods presented below. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our description of the business in Item 1, \u201cBusiness\u201d in this report, and our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs of our management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in or implied by forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed herein, particularly in the section entitled \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nAs of December 31, 2015, we are one of the world's largest providers of sand-based proppant solutions and for nearly 40 years have been a pioneer in the development of high performance proppants used by Exploration & Production (\u201cE&P\u201d) companies to enhance the productivity of their oil and gas wells. We offer the broadest range of proppants available in the market today, including high quality sand and a variety of resin-coated products. All of our frac sand exceeds API specifications. Additionally, for more than 120 years, we and our predecessor companies have provided high quality sand-based products, strong technical leadership and applications knowledge to end users in the Industrial & Recreational (\u201cI&R\u201d) markets.\nAs one of the industry leaders, our asset base includes 798 million tons of proven and probable mineral reserves, which we believe is one of the largest reserve bases in the industry. Due to the continuing challenging conditions in the oil and gas markets, we continue to adjust our operational footprint to minimize our costs. As of March 2016, we have 11 sand processing facilities (7 of which are active) with 14.8 million tons of annual sand processing capacity. In 2015, we closed our sand processing facilities in Readfield, Wisconsin and Wexford, Michigan and idled our facilities in Brewer, Missouri, Shakopee, Minnesota, and Hager City, Wisconsin. We also have 10 coating facilities (6 of which are active) with 2.3 million tons of annual coating capacity. Our coating facilities include operations in Mexico, Denmark and China, through which we serve international oil and gas markets. In 2015, we closed our resin-coating facility in Bridgman, Michigan and idled resin-coating facilities in Voca, Texas and Cutler, Illinois and SSP-coating facilities in Fresno, Texas.\nWe are capable of Class I railroad deliveries to each of North America's major oil and gas producing basins and also have the flexibility to ship our product via barge, marine terminals and trucks to reach our customers as needed. We operate an integrated logistics platform consisting of 43 active proppant distribution terminals and a fleet of approximately 10,100 railcars (net of subleases). We have recently expanded our unit train destinations to two production facilities and seven in-basin terminals, which reduce freight costs and improve cycle times for our rail car fleet. In order to better align our logistics network with customer demand and to reduce costs, we discontinued activity at ten transloading terminals and opened seven new terminals in 2015.\nOur operations are organized into two segments based on the primary end markets we serve: (i) Proppant Solutions and (ii) Industrial & Recreational (I&R) Products. Our Proppant Solutions segment predominantly provides sand-based proppants for use in hydraulic fracturing operations throughout the U.S. and Canada, Argentina, Mexico, China, northern Europe and the United Arab Emirates. Our I&R segment provides raw, coated, and custom blended sands to the foundry, building products, glass, turf and landscape and filtration industries primarily in North America. We believe our two market segments are complementary. Our ability to sell to a wide range of customers across multiple end markets allows us to maximize the recovery of our reserve base within our mining operations and to reduce the cyclicality of our earnings.\nRecent Trends and Outlook\nRecent trends driving demand for our proppants and commercial silica include:\n \u2022 Level of drilling activity and demand for proppants. Through 2014, the growth in the use of horizontal drilling utilizing hydraulic fracturing as a means to extract hydrocarbons from shale formations dramatically increased the number of oil and gas rigs operating in North America. This increased drilling activity contributed to substantial growth in demand for proppants from 2009 to 2014. However, during the fourth quarter of 2014, increasing global supply of oil, in conjunction with slowing growth of global oil demand, created downward pressure on crude oil prices, which has continued through 2015. As a result, various E&P companies reduced drilling and capital programs, resulting in significantly reduced rig counts. North American rig counts have fallen significantly from September 2014 to December 2015, which has resulted in reduced drilling activity and has negatively impacted the demand for proppants in 2015. During the same period, however, E&P companies, in partnership with oilfield service companies, are continuing to refine their well designs and hydraulic fracturing techniques to maximize hydrocarbon recovery from each well. These techniques vary based on formation and well geology, but some of the more pervasive recent trends include longer lateral drilling lengths coupled with an increased number of hydraulic fracturing stages per well. E&P and oilfield service companies have also been increasing the amount of proppant used per frac stage and, together, these techniques have greatly increased the volume of proppant used in the completion of each well (referred to as \u201cproppant intensity\u201d). The trend of increasing proppant intensity has offset, to some extent, the decrease in demand for proppants resulting from reduced rig counts and drilling activity. \n \u2022 Shift in drilling activity and demand mix. The level of drilling activity for oil and gas can have an impact on the demand for proppant and the mix of proppant we sell. In 2014, with the rapid growth of drilling deep wells in regions such as the Permian region, and drilling wells in regions that were prone to the flowback of proppant, we saw a rapid increase in demand for our resin-coated proppants. In late 2014 and 2015, lower crude oil prices have caused E&P companies to seek ways to reduce short-term operating costs, and, as a result, we have seen reduced demand for our resin-coated proppants. Further, lower crude oil prices have caused many operators to drill fewer of the deeper and more expensive wells in an effort to reduce production costs, which has also had an adverse impact on the demand for resin-coated proppants, particularly those designed to add strength for higher closer pressures. There can be ongoing shifts in grade sizes that impact the demand for our raw sand proppants. \n \u2022 Volatility in selling prices for proppants. The rapid growth in demand for proppants in 2014 driven by relatively high oil and gas prices and high levels of drilling activity caused selling prices for proppants to increase as the market for proppants was generally undersupplied. This imbalance of supply and demand caused many proppant suppliers to expand production capacity in anticipation of continued growth in demand. However, the rapid decline in oil and gas prices that occurred later in 2014 and in 2015 led to reduced drilling activity and reduced demand for proppants. As a result, the proppant market is in a position of oversupply, which has caused selling prices for all proppants to decline significantly in 2015. It is unclear when global oil and gas prices and increased drilling activity will begin to increase the demand for proppants, or when industry production capacity will contract enough to bring supply and demand more into balance and put upward pressure on selling prices. \n \u2022 Demand for in-basin delivery of proppant. In recent years, many customers sought to outsource proppant logistics and to purchase proppant at the basin, allowing them to focus on their core competencies, minimize inventory costs, and maximize flexibility. In 2015, approximately 75% of our proppant sales volume was sold in-basin, down from approximately 85% in 2014. In the second half of 2015, we saw an increase in demand from larger oilfield service customers for large volume shipments that can be taken directly from our plants. With our increasing capability to provide low-cost unit train shipments directly to large customers while also shipping unit trains to certain of our own in-basin terminals, we are well-equipped to take advantage of shifting demand. \n \u2022 Increased demand for unit train deliveries. With the shift of larger oilfield services customers toward shipments taken directly from our plants, there is also a greater demand for shipments via unit trains to \n enhance the economics of deliveries. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we shipped 68 unit trains representing approximately 74% of Northern White sand volumes with a total of 208 unit trains shipped during the year. We are well-positioned to help our customers lower their costs and improve delivery, as we now have seven unit train-capable destinations. \n \u2022 Continued stable demand in industrial end markets. Sales in our I&R Products segment are driven by macroeconomic factors such as housing starts, light vehicle sales, repair and remodel activity and industrial production. To the extent these demand drivers continue on their current trends, we expect that demand for our commercial silica products will remain relatively stable. \nHow We Generate Our Sales\nWe derive our sales by mining, processing and transporting sand-based proppants and silica sand products that our customers purchase for use in a wide variety of applications. In our Proppant Solutions business for the year ended December 31, 2015, we sold approximately 75% of our North American proppant volume through our network of terminals at selling prices that are set by local market dynamics. The remaining volume in the Proppant Solutions business is sold to customers directly from our mining and production facilities. The average selling prices for products sold through our terminals are higher than the average selling prices for comparable products sold from our production facilities due to costs incurred to handle and transport the products from the production facilities to the terminals. Generally, logistics costs can comprise 70-80% of the delivered cost of Northern White frac sand, depending on the basin into which the product is delivered. Due to the closer proximity of distribution terminals to our production facility, the amount of logistics costs included in the total delivered cost of our Texas Gold frac sand generally will be lower than that for our Northern White frac sand.\nWe primarily sell products under supply agreements with terms that vary by contract. Generally, the selling prices specified in our contracts are based on market prices. We believe that this approach to contract pricing allows us to reduce prices and retain or gain volume in market downcycles and capture higher prices in market upcycles. Our contracts have a variety of volume provisions. While certain of our contracts have no minimum volume requirements, certain of the agreements require the customer to purchase a specified percentage of its proppant requirements or a minimum volume of proppant from us. Certain of these minimum volume contracts include a provision which may trigger penalties if the purchased volume does not meet the required minimums.\nOur Proppant Solutions segment represented 86% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015. A large portion of our sales is generated by our top customers, and the loss of, or significant reduction in, purchases by our largest customers could adversely affect our operations. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our top ten proppant customers collectively represented 70% and 66% of our revenues, respectively. During the same periods, sales in the aggregate to our top two customers, Halliburton Company (\u201cHalliburton\u201d) and FTS International Services, LLC (\u201cFTSI\u201d), collectively accounted for 43% and 36% of our revenues, respectively.\nOur I&R business segment has over 770 customers and represented 14% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015. In our I&R business, we use our network of I&R distribution terminals to sell products from our production facilities to distributors which sell the product to the end user.\nThe Costs of Conducting Our Business\nThe principal costs involved in operating our business are logistics costs associated with transporting products from our production facilities to our terminals; payroll costs for personnel at our production, terminal and administrative facilities; resin and other raw materials and supplies used in the production of our products; and maintenance and repair costs at our production facilities. We own or lease most of our sand reserves, the combination of which, we believe, helps us maintain a very competitive cost position.\nLogistics costs, including freight, railcar leases, demurrage and handling, represented approximately 37% and 33% of our revenues during the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Freight costs primarily represent charges to transport our product by rail, but we also ship product by truck and barge. In order to move product by rail, we lease a substantial number of railcars under operating leases with durations ranging from three to seven years. We currently have approximately 8,900 railcars under lease and 1,200 railcars made available to us from our customers, giving us a total fleet of approximately 10,100 railcars (net of 200 cars currently subleased). Demurrage costs are charged by the railroads based on the time a railcar spends on the rail in excess of the allotted time. These costs can vary significantly from period to period driven by high levels of rail activity at a terminal and changes in the timing of fulfilling customer orders. Handling costs are incurred at our distribution and terminal facilities to move product from one mode of transportation to another (e.g., truck to railcar) and to move product into storage facilities. Storage costs are incurred when railcars are temporarily taken out of service and stored at a rail yard or storage facility.\nLabor costs, including wages and benefits, represented approximately 13% and 10% of revenues during the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Approximately 16% of our workforce was party to collective bargaining contracts as of December 31, 2015.\nWe use a significant amount of resins and additives in the production of our coated products in both our Proppant Solutions and I&R businesses. We purchase these resins under supply agreements that contain annual pricing adjustments based on the cost of phenol, the primary component of the resins we buy. We also supply a portion of our resin requirements from our resin manufacturing facility located in Michigan. The cost of resins and additives represented approximately 8% and 11% of revenues during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nOur selling, general and administrative costs, which include the wages and benefits costs noted above, represented approximately 10% and 8% of revenues during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These costs are related to our corporate operations, including costs for the sales and marketing; research and development; finance; legal; and environmental, health and safety functions of our organization. Since becoming a public company, we incur additional legal, accounting, insurance and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. These requirements include compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as well as other rules implemented by the SEC, and applicable stock exchange rules.\nWe capitalize the costs of our mining and processing equipment and depreciate it over its expected useful life. We also capitalize the costs to remove overburden on our sand reserves for our surface mines and amortize them based on the actual tons mined. Depreciation, depletion, and amortization costs represented approximately 8% and 4% of revenues during the years ended December, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Repair and maintenance costs that do not involve the replacement of major components of our equipment and facilities are expensed as incurred. These repair and maintenance costs can be significant due to the abrasive nature of our products and represented approximately 3% and 2% of revenues during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nHow We Evaluate Our Business\nOur management uses a variety of financial and operational metrics to analyze our performance across our Proppant Solutions and I&R Products segments. This segmentation is based on the primary end markets we serve, our management structure and the financial information that is reviewed by the Chief Executive Officer in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. We evaluate the performance of these segments based on their volumes sold, average selling price and segment contribution margin. We do not evaluate the performance of the segments on a margin percentage basis, as that is a function of the channel in which a given product is sold (for example, in-basin sales generate higher selling price but comparable per ton margin, resulting in reduced margin percentage) and product mix. Additionally, we consider a number of factors in evaluating the\nperformance of the business as a whole, including total volumes sold and Adjusted EBITDA. We view these metrics as important factors in evaluating our profitability and review these measurements frequently to analyze trends and make decisions.\nSegment Contribution Margin\nSegment contribution margin is a key metric that management uses to evaluate our operating performance and to determine resource allocation between segments. Segment contribution margin is defined as total revenues less the cost of goods sold to produce and deliver the products, less selling, general and administrative expenses that are directly attributable to each segment. The definition excludes certain corporate costs not associated with the operations of the segment. These unallocated costs include costs related to corporate functional areas such as administration, accounting, information technology, human resources, research and development, business development and sustainable development.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures that are used by management and external users of our financial statements, such as lenders and rating agencies.\nWe define EBITDA as net income before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation, depletion and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before non-cash stock-based compensation, management fees and reimbursement of expenses to our financial sponsor, transaction expenses, impairment of assets, loss on extinguishment of debt, gain or loss on disposal of certain assets, and other non-cash or non-recurring income or expenses.\nManagement believes EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful because they allow us to more effectively evaluate our operating performance and compare the results of our operations from period to period without regard to our financing methods, capital structure or non-recurring or non-operating expenses. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered as alternatives to, or more meaningful than, net income or cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP as indicators of our operating performance or liquidity. Certain items excluded from EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company's financial performance, such as a company's cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are components of EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA. Although we attempt to determine EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in a manner that is consistent with other companies in our industry, our computations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are widely followed measures of operating performance and may also be used by investors to measure our ability to meet debt service requirements.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:\n\n (1) Represents the cost in the period for stock-based awards issued to our employees. \n (2) Includes fees and expenses paid to American Securities LLC for consulting and management services pursuant to a management consulting agreement. The agreement was terminated upon the Initial Public Offering of the Company in October 2014. \n (3) Includes losses related to the sale and disposal of certain assets in property, plant, and equipment. \n (4) Expenses associated with evaluation of potential acquisitions of businesses, some of which were completed. \n (5) Expenses associated with the impairment of a foreign production facility. \n (6) Expenses associated with restructuring activities and plant closures, including pension withdrawal and other liablities, asset impairments and severance payments. \n (7) Represents the write-off of deferred financing fees in relation to the amendment of our Revolving Credit Facility. \n (8) Expenses associated with the impairment of goodwill in the Proppant Solutions segment. \n (9) Expenses associated with an audit of our Employee Stock Bonus Plan. \n (10) Represents the loss on a portion of the remaining unamortizaed deferred financing fees upon entering a new credit facility. \nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents our consolidated statement of operations and certain operating data. The results of operating by segment are discussed in further detail following the consolidated overview.\n Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nRevenues\nRevenues decreased $527.8 million, or 39%, to $828.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $1,356.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, due to decreased volumes, pricing compression, and product mix primarily in the Proppant Solutions segment.\nRevenues in the Proppant Solutions segment decreased $522.1 million, or 42%, to $710.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $1,232.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Total volumes decreased 14% to 6.2 million tons in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2014. Raw frac sand volumes decreased slightly to 5.4 million tons in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 5.7 million tons in the year ended December 31, 2014. The average selling price for raw frac sand in 2015 decreased approximately 19% from 2014. Coated proppant volumes decreased 48% to 0.8 million tons in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 1.5 million tons in the year ended December 31, 2014. The average selling price for resin-coated proppants in 2015 decreased approximately 18% from 2014. The decrease in Proppant Solutions revenue was due to pricing declines, a shift in sales toward FOB plant shipments, and declines in resin-coated proppant volumes primarily in the second half of the year.\nRevenues in the I&R Products segment decreased $5.6 million, or 5%, to $118.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $124.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Volumes declined slight to 2.3 million tons in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2.4 million tons in the year ended December 31, 2014. I&R segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 was impacted by downward pressure in the U.S. foundry market as well as a shift in customer and product mix in the business.\nSegment Contribution Margin\nContribution margin in the Proppant Solutions segment decreased $360.0 million, or 84%, to $70.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $430.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in segment contribution margin was primarily driven by lower volumes, changes in product mix, decreased selling prices, higher operating costs per ton due to lower volumes over which to absorb fixed costs such as railcars and logistics, and non-recurring impairment and restructuring charges in the year ended December 31, 2015. The Proppant Solutions segment contribution margin includes non-recurring impairment and restructuring charges of $82.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nContribution margin in the I&R Products segment decreased $9.2 million, or 27%, to $25.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $34.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily driven by non-recurring restructuring charges associated with plant closures, such as impairment of property, plant, and equipment, and liabilities associated with pension withdrawal and land reclamation. The Industrial & Recreational Products segment contribution margin includes non-recurring impairment and restructuring charges of $13.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased $33.6 million, or 29%, to $80.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $114.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. SG&A attributable to our segments decreased $8.8 million. Corporate SG&A costs decreased $24.8 million primarily due to lower costs associated with incentive plans, pension contributions, and reduced workforce this year as well as non-recurring costs in the prior year associated with the October 2014 Initial Public Offering.\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization increased $7.4 million, or 12%, to $66.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $59.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in depreciation is due to more assets placed in service primarily related to the Wedron plant expansion.\nIncome (Loss) from Operations\nIncome (loss) from operations decreased $341.8 million, or 110%, to a loss of $30.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to income of $311.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Earnings in 2015 were largely impacted by non-recurring impairment and restructuring charges of $96.7 million as well as declines in contribution margins due to lower volumes and decreased selling prices.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $1.4 million, or 2%, to $62.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $60.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to interest rate swap agreements, entered into in 2013, that became effective October 2015.\nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes\nThe provision (benefit) for income taxes decreased $79.4 million, or 103%, to arrive at a benefit of $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to a provision of $77.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Income before income taxes decreased $341.9 million or 138% to a loss of $93.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to income of $248.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The primary items impacting the tax provision include an increase in the valuation allowance primarily related to U.S. alternative minimum tax credits and U.S. research credits; a goodwill impairment charge with no corresponding income tax benefit; and the accrual of deferred taxes on our accumulated foreign undistributed earnings resulting from a change in our indefinite reinvestment assertion. These unfavorable items were partially offset by a 9.7% effective income tax benefit related to depletion.\nNet Income (Loss)\nNet income (loss) decreased $262.6 million, or 154%, to a loss of $92.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to income of $170.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 due to the factors noted above.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased $259.2 million, or 65%, to $138.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $397.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decline in Adjusted EBITDA was largely due to declines in proppant pricing and volumes.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013\nRevenues\nRevenues increased $368.1 million, or 37%, to $1,356.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $988.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to increased raw and resin-coated frac sand volumes in our Proppant Solutions segment and, to a lesser extent, increases in the selling price of certain grades of raw frac sand during the year.\nRevenues in the Proppant Solutions segment increased $376.0 million, or 44%, to $1,232.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $856.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Total volumes increased 40% to 7.2 million tons in 2014 compared to 5.1 million tons in 2013. Raw frac sand volumes increased 1.6 million tons, or 40%, to 5.7 million tons compared to 4.1 million tons during this period. The average selling price for raw sand increased 7%, which was primarily the result of an increase in the proportion of raw sand sold through our terminal network and an increase in the selling price of certain grades of sand during the year, partially offset by a shift in volumes sold toward finer grades of raw sand (which generally carry lower selling prices than coarser grades) and increases in sales of Texas Gold brown sand since the acquisition of the Voca facility as part of the acquisition of the proppant assets from FTSI in September 2013. Coated proppant volumes increased 43% to 1.5 million tons in 2014 compared to 1.0 million tons in 2013. The average selling price for resin-coated proppants decreased 2%, which was primarily the result of customer mix and the full year impact of selling price declines taken in 2013, partially offset by a shift in volumes sold towards higher-priced products.\nRevenues in the I&R Products segment decreased $8.0 million, or 6%, to $124.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $132.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Volumes decreased 30,776 tons, or 1%, to 2.4 million tons in 2014 compared to 2.5 million tons in 2013. The average selling priced decreased 5% as a result of no longer pre-paying and adding freight to our invoices for a customer in our glass-end market.\nSegment Contribution Margin\nContribution margin in the Proppant Solutions segment increased $134.4 million, or 45%, to $430.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $296.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was driven by the increase in sales volume for resin-coated proppants, and the increase in volume for raw frac sand noted above.\nContribution margin in the I&R Products segment was relatively flat, decreasing $0.3 million, or 1%, to $34.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $34.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses increased $32.3 million, or 39%, to $114.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $81.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. SG&A attributable to our segments increased $4.9 million due to increased sales and marketing costs for our Proppant Solutions segment (included in Segment Contribution Margin noted above). Corporate SG&A costs increased $27.0 million primarily due to $9.2 million of IPO costs, increased costs associated with our incentive bonus plans, increased costs associated with implementing logistics planning tools, and other increased corporate costs to support the growth of our business, partially offset by non-recurring business development costs associated with our acquisition activity in 2013.\nDepreciation, Depletion, and Amortization\nDepreciation, depletion, and amortization increased $21.6 million, or 57%, to $59.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $37.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 due to the increase in fixed and intangible assets arising from the FTSI transaction and capital expenditures primarily due to increased production and logistics capacities.\nIncome from Operations\nIncome from operations increased $83.6 million, or 37%, to $311.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $228.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily as a result of increased gross margins, partially offset by increased selling, general, and administrative expenses, both described above.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased $1.1 million, or 2%, to $60.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $61.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Additional interest expense from additional borrowings to finance the Great Plains and FTSI transactions was offset by an increase in interest capitalized on construction projects in 2014.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes increased $32.2 million, or 71%, to $77.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $45.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Income before income\ntaxes increased $98.1 million or 65% to $248.0 million in 2014 compared to $149.9 million in 2013. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2014 was 31.2% compared to 30.2% for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a reduction in the impact of the depletion deduction due to the high growth of our resin-coated business and a reduction in the amount of the manufacturers' deduction due to lower taxable income resulting from the exercise of stock options in 2014.\nNet Income\nNet income increased $65.7 million, or 63%, to $170.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $104.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 due to the factors noted above.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $104.7 million, or 36%, to $397.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $292.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, due primarily to an increase in segment contribution margin.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur principal liquidity requirements historically have been to service our debt, to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs, to finance acquisitions and to occasionally pay dividends to our stockholders. We have met our liquidity and capital investment needs with funds generated through operations and through incremental borrowings. We also have the ability to raise capital through the issuance of shares of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding term loan borrowing of $1.24 billion. A term loan payment in the amount of $156.1 million is due in March 2017. As of the date of this report, we believe that our cash on hand and cash generated through operations will be sufficient to meet cash obligations, such as working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures, and scheduled debt payments, over the next twelve months. In addition, we have a revolving credit facility that can provide additional liquidity, if needed. As of December 31, 2015 we had $31.25 million of availability under our revolving credit facility with $11.5 million committed to letters of credit, leaving net availability at $19.7 million. See \u201cCredit Facilities\u201d below for more information regarding our Revolving Credit Facility.\nA continued sustained downturn in our business's key markets could significantly impact our forecasts. While we believe that our operations forecasts are reasonable, the forecasts are based on assumptions, and market conditions impacting the industry, primarily the proppant business, are uncertain. In the event the operating results are significantly worse than projected or we are unsuccessful in generating sufficient liquidity, we may not be able to satisfy our debt obligations and would be forced to restructure these obligations. In order to address this risk, we are implementing reductions in operating costs, selling, general, and administrative costs, reduced planned capital spending, working capital improvements, and permitted asset sales.\nWorking Capital\nWorking capital is the amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities and is a measure of our ability to pay our liabilities as they become due. Our working capital was $274.0 million and $318.7 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The following table presents the components of our working capital as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively:\n Accounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable decreased $132.5 million to $73.6 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $206.1 million at December 31, 2014. The decrease relates to the collection of higher 2014 receivables and a decline in the balance driven from the decline in sales volumes and selling prices during 2015.\nInventory\nInventory consists of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods at plants and terminals. The cost of finished goods includes processing costs and transportation costs to terminals. The decrease in inventory to $70.5 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $131.6 million at December 31, 2014 relates to lower sales and is also due to efforts to decrease inventory levels to match projected decreasing demand, particularly for resin-coated products.\nPrepaid Expenses and Other Assets\nPrepaid expenses and other assets decreased $0.9 million to $39.9 million at December 31, 2015 from $40.8 million at December 31, 2014, primarily due to the collection of refundable income taxes in 2015.\nAccounts Payable\nAccounts payable decreased $48.1 million to $40.4 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $88.5 million at December 31, 2014. The decrease in accounts payable is due to reduced purchasing activity driven by lower sales volumes.\nAccrued Expenses\nThe decrease in accrued expenses to $26.8 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $36.0 million at December 31, 2014 was primarily due to the payout of accrued bonuses related to the year ended December 31, 2014, reduced incentive and pension contribution costs in 2015, and a reduction in accrued taxes from the tax benefit position in 2015.\nCash Flow Analysis\n Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities consist primarily of net income adjusted for non-cash items, including depreciation, depletion, and amortization and the effect of changes in working capital.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $236.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $205.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. This $30.7 million increase was primarily the result of changes in working capital, particularly a decrease in receivables and inventory.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $205.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $174.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2013. This $30.7 million increase was primarily the result of a $65.3 million increase in net income, partially offset by an increase in working capital for 2014 compared to 2013.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nInvesting activities consist primarily of capital expenditures for growth and maintenance, and in certain periods, investments to acquire strategic assets or businesses. Growth capital expenditures generally are for expansions of production or terminal capacities or new greenfield development of production capacity. Maintenance capital expenditures generally are for asset replacement and health, safety and quality improvements.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $114.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $138.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The $24.3 million decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in capital expenditures as declining volumes of sand sold in the oil and gas markets have reduced the rate at which we needed to expand production capacity.\nCapital expenditures of $113.8 million, including stripping costs, in the year ended December 31, 2015 were primarily focused on expansion of our sand processing capacities at our Wedron facility. Capital expenditures of $143.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 were associated with the expansion of our terminal\ninfrastructure, enhancing our unit train capabilities, and expansion of Propel SSP coating capacities. We believe that cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our anticipated capital expenditures in 2016, but financial results below our expectations could limit our ability to fund these expenditures.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $138.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $579.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. In the year ended December 31, 2013, $468.0 million was used for the acquisition of sand reserves and processing capacity in Minnesota (Great Plains), the acquisition of the rights to Propel SSP technology, and the acquisition of the proppant assets of FTSI. Capital expenditures increased $32.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.\nCapital expenditures were $143.5 million for 2014 and were primarily focused on continued development of self-suspending proppant (\u201cSSP\u201d) production facilities, construction of distribution terminals, continued expansion of rail logistics, and expansion of our sand processing capacities.\nNet Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities\nFinancing activities consist primarily of repayments under our Term Loans, capital leases, and other long-term debt reductions.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $25.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $7.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due payments on our Term Loans and capital leases, the decreases in tax benefits compared to the prior year for the exercise of stock options in the October 2014 Initial Public Offering, and refinancing fees in the current year associated with the extension of our B-1 Term Loan and amendment of our Revolving Credit Facility. We made payments of approximately $6.0 million against capital lease obligations.\nIn order to improve liquidity, we borrowed $41.0 million under our term loans in February 2014 to repay a similar amount outstanding under our revolving credit facility. In May 2015, we paid fees to extend the maturity dates of $161.5 million of our Term B-1 Loan from March 2017 to September 2019 to further improve near-term liquidity. In September 2015, we amended the terms of our Revolving Credit Facility. Please see further detail of our credit facilities in the \u201cCredit Facilities\u201d section below.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $7.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $410.5 million, which primarily related to borrowings used to acquire Great Plains and the FTSI assets. We also made payments of approximately $3.9 million against capital lease obligations in 2014.\nCredit Facilities\nOn September 5, 2013, we entered into the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (our \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d). Our Credit Agreement contains a revolving credit facility (\u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d) and two tranches of term loans (\u201cTerm B-1 Loans\u201d and \u201cTerm B-2 Loans\u201d). The Revolving Credit Facility and the Term B-1 and B-2 Loans are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our domestic assets.\nIn February 2014, we executed a joinder agreement to borrow $41 million in aggregate principal amount of additional Term B-2 Loans, bringing the total outstanding Term B-2 loans to $923.8 million. The proceeds of this borrowing were used to repay then outstanding amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nInitially, the Term B-1 Loans matured on March 15, 2017 and required quarterly principal repayments of $0.8 million (1% annually) with the balance due at maturity. The Term B-2 Loans mature on September 5, 2019 and require quarterly principal repayments of $2.2 million (1% annually) with the balance due at maturity. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility mature on September 5, 2018. In April and May 2015, we\nextended the maturity of $46.0 million and $115.5 million, respectively, of Term B-1 Loans (\u201cExtended Loans\u201d) until September 2019 (the same date as our Term B-2 Loans). The Extended Term B-1 Loans effectively were converted to Term B-2 Loans, and are treated as Term B-2 Loans, under the Credit Agreement for all purposes (including pricing), except for certain minor administrative differences and except that, prior to the Stated B-1 Maturity Date, the Extended Loans shall continue to amortize as Term B-1 Loans. Upon giving effect to the April 2015 and May 2015 Amendments, the maturity date of approximately $161.5 million in principal amount of outstanding Term B-1 Loans was extended, leaving approximately $156.6 million in principal amount of outstanding Term B-1 Loans (not including Extended Loans) maturing on the March 15, 2017. We paid fees of approximately $4.0 million to the lenders as a consent fee for the April and May 2015 Amendments.\nIn March 2014, we amended our Credit Agreement to reduce the applicable margin for Term B-1 and B-2 Base Rate loans to 2.50% and for Term B-1 and B-2 Eurodollar Rate loans to 3.50%. The Base Rate is the greater of prime rate, federal funds rate (subject to a 1.0% floor) plus 0.5%, 2%, or one-month LIBOR plus 1.0%. The adjusted Eurodollar Rate is subject to a 1.0% floor. With respect to borrowings under the Term B-1 Loans and Revolving Credit Facility, the 2% minimum for Base Rate borrowings and 1% for Eurodollar Rate borrowings did not apply. The applicable margin on the loans will be reduced by 0.25% if our leverage ratio falls below 2.75. As of December 31, 2015, Term B-1 Loans, Term B-2 Loans, Extended Term Loans and the borrowings under Revolving Credit Facility bore interest at 4.1%, 4.5%, 4.5% and 4.3%, respectively.\nThe terms of our Credit Agreement provide for customary representations and warranties and affirmative covenants. The Revolving Credit Facility also contains customary negative covenants setting forth limitations on further indebtedness, liens, investments, disposition of assets, acquisitions, junior payments and restrictions on subsidiary distributions.\nOur Revolving Credit Facility was increased from $75 million to $125 million after executing joinder agreements in August 2014 and September 2014, both of which increased the capacity of the Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2015, we entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement that modified the terms surrounding the Revolving Credit Facility. These modifications consisted primarily of (i) a reduction in the U.S. revolving commitments from $124 million to $99 million (while the aggregate Canadian revolving commitment remained at $1 million) and (ii) changes in the financial covenant governing the availability of amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility if, and only if, we have drawn, including letters of credit, more than $31.25 million on the Revolving Credit Facility. Generally, if our leverage ratio is greater than 4.75:1.00 during the period from the effective date of the Revolving Credit Facility amendment in the third quarter of 2015 through the fourth quarter of 2016, so long as the stated quarterly adjusted EBITDA thresholds are exceeded, the amount available to borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility is increased from $31.25 million to $40 million. Commencing with the end of the first quarter of 2017, the quarterly adjusted EBITDA thresholds are discontinued and the full amount of the revolving commitment ($100 million) is available so long as our quarterly leverage ratio does not exceed a revised limit (6.50:1.00 for the first quarter of 2017 declining to 4.75:1.00 for the fourth quarter of 2017). As of December 31, 2015, our leverage ratio was 8.96.\nAs of December 31, 2015, there were no borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility. However, there were $11.5 million of letters of credit outstanding, reducing the amount available to borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility to $19.72 million. We believe that the amount available under the Revolving Credit Facility, along with cash generated from operations and our substantial cash balance at December 31, 2015, provide adequate liquidity to allow us to meet our cash obligations over the next twelve months.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2015, we have contractual obligations for long-term debt, capital leases, operating leases, purchase obligations, and other long-term liabilities. The purchase obligations include approximately 3,000 railcars with future delivery dates in 2017 and 2018. We intend to satisfy these purchase obligations through leasing arrangements with third-party lessors. Substantially all of the operating lease obligations are for railcars.\n Environmental Matters\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing, among other things, hazardous materials, air and water emissions, environmental contamination and reclamation and the protection of the environment and natural resources. We have made, and expect to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the full amount of such future expenditures. We may also incur fines and penalties from time to time associated with noncompliance with such laws and regulations.\nIn 2015, we recorded an additional $1.1 million in future reclamation costs associated with a closed facility. There have been no other significant changes to environmental liabilities or future reclamation costs since December 31, 2014.\nWe discuss certain environmental matters relating to our various production and other facilities, certain regulatory requirements relating to human exposure to crystalline silica and our mining activity and how such matters may affect our business in the future under \u201cRegulation and Legislation\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and base our estimates on historical experience, current conditions and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Our actual results may materially differ from these estimates. These critical accounting policies and estimates should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements as filed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nListed below are the accounting policies we believe are critical to our financial statements due to the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved, and that we believe are critical to the understanding of our operations.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe periodically evaluate whether current events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, mineral reserves or mineral rights, goodwill, trade names and customer relationships, may not be recoverable. If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of future cash flows produced by the long-lived assets, or the appropriate grouping of assets, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available. If quoted market prices are not available, the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques, including a discounted value of estimated future cash flows. A detailed determination of the fair value may be carried forward from one year to the next if certain criteria have been met. We report an asset to be disposed of at the lower of its carrying value or its estimated net realizable value.\nFactors we generally consider important in our evaluation and that could trigger an impairment review of the carrying value of long-lived assets include expected operating trends, significant changes in the way assets are used, underutilization of our tangible assets, discontinuance of certain products by us or by our customers, and significant negative industry or economic trends.\nThe recoverability of the carrying value of our development stage mineral properties is dependent upon the successful development, start-up and commercial production of our mineral deposits and related processing facilities. Our evaluation of mineral properties for potential impairment primarily includes assessing the existence or availability of required permits and evaluating changes in our mineral reserves, or the underlying estimates and assumptions, including estimated production costs. Assessing the economic feasibility requires certain estimates, including the prices of products to be produced and processing recovery rates, as well as operating and capital costs.\nWe review definite-lived intangible assets, such as our supply agreements and acquired technology, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a definite-lived intangible asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. In cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the assets or asset groups.\nThe evaluation of goodwill or other intangible assets for possible impairment includes estimating fair value using one or a combination of valuation techniques, such as discounted cash flows or based on comparable companies or transactions. These valuations require us to make estimates and assumptions regarding future operating results, cash flows, changes in working capital and capital expenditures, selling prices, profitability, and the cost of capital. These judgments are particularly difficult given the recent industry environment, although we believe its assumptions and estimates are reasonable, deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce a materially different result.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nTrade accounts receivable are recognized at their invoiced amounts and do not bear interest. Credit is extended based on evaluation of a customer's financial condition and, generally, collateral is not required. Accounts receivable are generally due within 30 days, and are stated at amounts due from customers net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. Accounts outstanding longer than the payment terms are considered past due. We determine our allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time trade accounts\nreceivable are past due, our previous loss history, the customer's current ability to pay its obligation to us, and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole. Given the present industry environment in the oil and gas solutions segment, we may not have adequate warning of a potential credit and collection issue, and deviations from these estimates could produce additional credit losses. Ongoing credit evaluations are performed. We write-off accounts receivable when they are deemed uncollectible, and payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to the allowance for doubtful accounts.\nEquity Awards\nWe recognize stock based compensation expense using a fair value method. Fair value methods use a valuation model to theoretically value stock option grants even though they are not available for trading and are of longer duration. The Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model that we use includes the input of certain variables that are dependent on future expectations, including the expected lives of our options from grant date to exercise date, the volatility of a peer group of companies underlying common shares, and our expected dividend rate of zero. Our estimates of these variables are made for the purpose of using the valuation model to determine an expense for each reporting period and are not subsequently adjusted. We also estimate a forfeiture rate based on our historical experience, which could change over time. We value our restricted stock units at the closing price of our stock as of the date of issuance.\nFair Value of Derivatives\nWe record derivative instruments used to hedge interest rate exposure on the variable-rate debt obligations at their fair values. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or in other comprehensive income, depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedging relationship and, if it is, depending on the type of hedging relationship. For cash flow hedges in which we are hedging the variability of cash flows related to a variable-rate liability, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported in other comprehensive income in the periods during which earnings are impacted by the variability of the cash flows of the hedged item. The ineffective portion of all hedges is recognized in current period earnings. As interest expense is accrued on the debt obligation, amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to the interest rate swaps are reclassified into income to obtain a net cost on the debt obligation equal to the effective yield of the fixed rate of each swap. In the event that an interest rate swap is terminated prior to maturity, gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) remain deferred and are reclassified into earnings in the periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.\nThe fair values and effectiveness testing of our derivatives are based on prevailing market data and derived from proprietary models based on well recognized financial principles and reasonable estimates about relevant future market conditions including interest rates, counterparty risk, and credit risk. These assumptions could cause material changes in the fair value or effectiveness of our derivative instruments.\nTaxes\nDeferred taxes are provided on the liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. This approach requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based upon the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the expenses are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nWe recognize a tax benefit associated with an uncertain tax position when, in our judgment, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority. For a tax position that meets\nthe more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we initially and subsequently measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. The liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, case law developments and new or emerging legislation. Such adjustments are recognized entirely in the period in which they are identified. The effective tax rate includes the net impact of changes in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and subsequent adjustments as considered appropriate by management.\nWe evaluate quarterly the realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing the need for a valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are our forecast of future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction to utilize the asset, and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income might affect the ultimate realization of the net deferred tax assets. Factors that may affect our ability to achieve sufficient forecasted taxable income include, but are not limited to, the following: a decline in sales or margins, increased competition or loss of market share.\nIn addition, we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended time to resolve. We believe that adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years.\nThe largest permanent items in computing both our effective rate and taxable income are the deduction for statutory depletion and the manufacturers' deduction for manufacturers' products. The depletion deduction is dependent upon a mine-by-mine computation of both gross income from mining and taxable income.", "item_7_tables": "Table 152: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

and gas industry. The company has experienced significant challenges due to the downturn in the oil and gas markets, leading to operational adjustments to minimize costs, including facility closures and idling. The report includes a comprehensive examination of the company's financial obligations, liquidity, operating segments, and forward-looking statements.\n\nKey points from the report:\n\n- The company has a large reserve base and offers a wide range of proppants, including high-quality sand and resin-coated products.\n- As of the report's date, the company operated 11 sand processing facilities (7 active) and 10 coating facilities (6 active), with adjustments made to align with market demands and reduce costs.\n- A significant focus is on logistics, with an integrated platform to serve major oil and gas basins through various shipment modes, including unit train capabilities.\n- The report provides an in-depth discussion on recent trends and outlooks, noting a decline in drilling activity and proppant demand, shifts in the demand mix, volatility in proppant selling prices, and the market's oversupply condition.\n- The company sells products primarily under supply agreements with variable selling prices based on market prices and has significant reliance on a few major customers.\n- Operating costs are discussed, with logistics, labor, and raw materials as principal cost components.\n- The report outlines the usage of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as metrics to evaluate performance.\n\nFinancial highlights include:\n\n- A decrease in revenues year-over-year due to lower volumes and pricing pressure.\n- A reduction in segment contribution margin and an overall net loss attributed to factors such as lower volumes, pricing declines, and non-recurring charges.\n- Cash flow analysis reveals net cash provided by operating activities, a decrease in net cash used in investing activities due to less capital expenditure, and cash used in financing activities for debt payment and transaction fees.\n- A review of contractual obligations, detailing long-term debt, lease obligations, and purchase commitments.\n\nCritical accounting policies and estimates involved include impairment of long-lived assets, allowance for doubtful accounts, equity awards valuation, fair value of derivatives, and tax-related estimates and uncertainties.\n\nOverall, the report presents a company attempting to navigate a challenging market environment by optimizing operations, managing costs, and focusing heavily on logistics flexibility to meet customer demands effectively. The company is also proactively managing its debt and leveraging its substantial reserve base despite facing decreased demand and pricing pressures in its core markets."}
