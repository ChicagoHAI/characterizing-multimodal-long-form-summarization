As used herein, the terms Company,\u201d we,\u201d our\u201d and us\u201d refer to DCT Industrial Trust Inc. and its subsidiaries, including its operating partnership, DCT Industrial Operating Partnership LP. When we use the term DCT\u201d or DCT Industrial,\u201d we are referring to DCT Industrial Trust Inc. by itself, and not including any of its subsidiaries, and when we use the term the Operating Partnership,\u201d we are referring to DCT Industrial Operating Partnership LP by itself, and not including any of its subsidiaries.\nDCT was formed as a Maryland corporation in April 2002 and has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We are structured as an umbrella partnership REIT under which substantially all of our current and future business is, and will be, conducted through a majority owned and controlled subsidiary, DCT Industrial Operating Partnership LP, a Delaware limited partnership, for which DCT is the sole general partner. DCT owns properties through the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2015, DCT owned approximately 95.6% of the outstanding equity interests in the Operating Partnership.\nOur primary business objectives are to maximize long-term growth in Funds From Operations, or FFO, as defined on page 34, net asset value of our portfolio and total shareholder returns. In our pursuit of these long-term objectives, we seek to:\nTable 126: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> maximize cash flows from existing properties;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> deploy capital into quality acquisitions and development opportunities which meet our asset, location and financial criteria; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> recycle capital by selling assets that no longer fit our investment criteria and reinvesting the proceeds into higher growth opportunities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOutlook\nWe seek to maximize long-term earnings growth and value within the context of overall economic conditions, primarily through increasing occupancy, rents and operating income at existing properties and developing and acquiring high-quality properties with attractive operating income and value growth prospects. Fundamentals for industrial real estate continue to improve in response to general improvement in the economy as well as trends that particularly favor industrial assets, including the growth of e-commerce and U.S. based manufacturing. We expect moderate economic growth to continue through 2016, which should result in continued positive demand for warehouse space as companies expand and upgrade their distribution and production platforms.\nIn response to positive net absorption and lower market vacancy levels, rental rates are increasing in most of our markets. Rental concessions, such as free rent, have also declined in all markets. Consistent with recent experience and based on current market conditions, we expect average net effective rental rates on new leases signed during 2016 to be higher than the rates on expiring leases.\nNew development has begun to increase in many markets where fundamentals have improved, however construction remains below current levels of net absorption in most markets and below historical peak levels. We expect that the operating environment will continue to be favorable for owners and developers given our favorable outlook for strong market occupancy levels and rental rate growth.\nWe expect same store net operating income to be higher in 2016 than it was in 2015, primarily as a result of higher occupancy in 2016 and the impact of increasing rental rates on leases signed in 2016 compared to expiring leases.\nIn terms of capital investment, we will pursue the selective development of new buildings and the opportunistic acquisition of buildings in markets where we perceive demand and market rental rates will provide attractive financial returns.\nWe anticipate continuing to selectively dispose of non-strategic assets to fund our investment in new development and acquisitions in an effort to enhance long-term growth in net asset value, earnings and cash flows as well as to enhance the overall quality of our portfolio.\nWe anticipate having sufficient liquidity to fund our operating expenses, including costs to maintain our properties and distributions, though we may finance investments, including acquisitions and developments, with the issuance of new common shares, proceeds from asset sales or through additional borrowings. Please see Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for additional discussion.\nInflation\nThe U.S. economy has experienced low inflation over the past several years and as a result, inflation has not had a significant impact on our business. Moreover, most of our leases require the customers to pay their share of operating expenses, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation. In addition, most of our leases expire within five years which enables us to replace existing leases with new leases at then-existing market rates. While slowing global growth has the potential to dampen demand for distribution space, we have not yet seen any indications of this reduced demand.\nSummary of Significant Transactions and Activities During 2015\nSignificant transactions for the year ended December 31, 2015\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Acquisitions\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> During the year ended December 31, 2015, we acquired 17 buildings comprising 2.4 million square feet in the Atlanta, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Miami, Northern California, Phoenix and Seattle markets for a total purchase price of approximately $153.1 million.

As a result of efforts working with our bank and federal law enforcement authorities, we have recovered approximately $3.0 million of the amount transferred. In addition, we have incurred $0.3 million of other costs related to the investigation of this incident. We filed a claim with our insurance carriers related to this incident and received $0.8 million in insurance proceeds as of December 31, 2015. Accordingly, during the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded an expense of $2.6 million in General and administrative\u201d expense related to this incident and the associated internal investigation. We do not expect any additional recoveries in the future.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nGeneral\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U. S. ( GAAP\u201d) requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different or different assumptions were made, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements. Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Estimates, judgments and assumptions are based on historical experiences that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. From time to time we re-evaluate those estimates and assumptions.\nThe Company's significant accounting policies are described in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d. These policies were followed in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 and are consistent with the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe Company has identified the following significant accounting policies as critical accounting policies. These accounting policies have the most significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, subjective and/or complex estimates.\nCapitalization of Costs\nSee the Company's accounting policy for Capitalization of Costs with respect to capitalization of project costs versus the expensing of repair and maintenance costs as described in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d. As described in our policy, we capitalize costs such as personnel, office and other expenses based on an estimate of the time spent on projects that are directly related to capital projects and acquisition of leases. Capitalized costs are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in construction in progress for each specific property.\nFor all development projects, the Company uses its professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred. The Company capitalizes interest, real estate taxes, insurance and payroll and costs associated with individuals directly responsible for and who spend their time on development activities. Capitalization is ceased upon substantial completion of the project. These costs are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in construction in progress for each specific property.\nAcquisition of Investment Properties\nThe Company allocates the purchase price of real estate to identifiable tangible assets such as land, building, land improvements and tenant improvements acquired based on their fair value. In estimating the fair value of each component management considers appraisals, replacement cost, its own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties, market rental data and other related information.\nImpairment of Properties\nThe Company periodically evaluates its long-lived assets, including investments in properties, for indicators of impairment. The judgements regarding the existence of indicators of impairment are based on the operating performance, market conditions, as well as the Company's ability to hold and its intent with regard to each property. The judgements regarding whether the carrying amounts of these assets may not be recoverable are based on estimates of future undiscounted cash flows from properties which include estimates of future operating performance and market conditions.\nImpairment of Investments in and Advances to Unconsolidated Joint Ventures\nThe Company evaluates investments in and advances to unconsolidated joint ventures for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that there may be an other-than-temporary decline in value. The judgments regarding other-than-temporary declines in value are based on operating performance, market conditions, the Company's ability to and intent to hold as well as its ability to influence significant decisions of the venture.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nDerivative instruments and hedging activities require management to make judgments regarding fair value, the nature of its derivatives and their effectiveness as hedges. These judgments determine if the changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are reported in our Consolidated Statement of Operations as a component of net income or as a component of comprehensive income and as a component of equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. While management believes its judgments are reasonable, a change in a derivative's effectiveness as a hedge could materially affect expenses, net income and equity.\nRevenue Recognition\nAt the inception of a new lease arrangement, including new leases that arise from amendments, we assess the terms and conditions to determine the proper lease classification. A lease arrangement is classified as an operating lease if none of the following criteria are met: (i) transfer of ownership to the lessee, (ii) lessee has a bargain purchase option during or at the end of the lease term, (iii) the lease term is equal to 75% or more of the underlying property's economic life, or (iv) the present value of future minimum lease payments (excluding executory costs) are equal to 90% or more of the excess estimated fair value (over retained investment tax credits) of the leased building. Generally, none of our leases meet any of the above criteria and, as such, are classified as operating leases. If the assumptions utilized in the above classification assessments were different, our lease classification for accounting purposes may have been different; thus the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would have been impacted, which may be material to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe recognize rental revenues on a straight-line basis under which contractual rent increases are recognized evenly over the lease term when collectability is reasonably assured and the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of the property.\nCertain properties have leases that provide for tenant occupancy during periods where no rent is due or where minimum rent payments change during the term of the lease. Accordingly, we record receivables from tenants that we expect to collect over the remaining lease term rather than currently, which are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a straight-line rent receivable.\nIf the lease provides for tenant improvements, we determine whether the tenant improvements are owned by the tenant or us. When we are the owner of the tenant improvements, the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the physical leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially completed. When the Company is the owner of the tenant improvements, any tenant improvements funded by the tenant are treated as lease payments which are deferred and amortized into income over the lease term. When the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements, we record any tenant improvement allowance funded as a lease incentive and amortize it as a reduction of revenue over the lease term.\nAbove and below market lease values for acquired properties are recorded as the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and management's estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease and amortized over the reasonably assured lease term.\nResults of Operations\nSummary of the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014\nWe are a leading industrial real estate company specializing in the acquisition, development, leasing and management of bulk distribution and light industrial properties located in high-volume distribution markets in the U.S. As of December 31, 2015, the Company owned interests in or had under development approximately 71.1 million square feet of properties leased to approximately 900 customers, including 7.5 million square feet managed on behalf of three institutional capital management joint venture partners. Also as of December 31, 2015, we consolidated 390 operating properties, three development properties, five redevelopment properties and four consolidated operating properties classified as held for sale. As of December 31, 2014, we consolidated 393 operating properties, seven development properties and six redevelopment properties. As of December 31, 2015, we had 327 properties in same store and 75 in non-same store consisting of properties that did not meet our same store definition, which includes 67 operating properties and eight development and redevelopment properties.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2015 to the year ended December 31, 2014\nThe following table presents the changes in rental revenues, rental expenses and real estate taxes, property net operating income, other revenue and other income and other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Our same store portfolio includes all operating properties that we owned for the entirety of both the current and prior year reporting periods. Developed properties are generally included in same store properties once they are stabilized. We generally consider buildings stabilized when occupancy reaches 90%. Non-same store operating properties include properties not meeting the same store criteria and exclude development and redevelopment properties. The same store portfolio for the periods presented totaled 327 operating properties and was comprised of 49.5 million square feet. A discussion of these changes follows in the table below (in thousands):\nTable 152: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td>

As of December 31, 2014, we had 286 properties in same store and 120 in non-same store consisting of properties that did not meet our same store definition, which includes 116 operating properties and four development and redevelopment properties.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2014 to the year ended December 31, 2013\nThe following table presents the changes in rental revenues, rental expenses and real estate taxes, property net operating income, other revenue and other income and other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Our same store portfolio includes all operating properties that we owned for the entirety of both the current and prior year reporting periods. Developed properties are generally included in same store properties once they are stabilized. We generally consider buildings stabilized when occupancy reaches 90%. Non-same store operating properties include properties not meeting the same store criteria and exclude development and redevelopment properties. The same store portfolio for the periods presented totaled 286 operating properties and was comprised of 41.9 million square feet.

This change was primarily due to an increase in property net operating income attributable to acquired properties and operating performance at existing properties.\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased $41.1 million to $218.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $259.6 million during the same period in 2014. This change was primarily due to a decrease of $176.5 million in cash outflows from acquisitions; partially offset by an increase of $47.9 million in cash outflows related to capital expenditures and development activities, as reflected in the table below, a decrease of $40.9 million in cash inflows from dispositions, a decrease of $37.2 million in cash inflows related to timing of 1031 proceeds received from dispositions and a decrease of $11.4 million in cash inflows from distributions of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures.\nWe pursue the acquisition of buildings and land and consider selective development of new buildings in markets where we perceive that demand and market rental rates will provide attractive financial returns. The amount of cash used related to acquisitions and development and redevelopment investments will vary from period to period based on a number of factors, including, among others, current and anticipated future market conditions impacting the desirability of investments, leasing results with respect to our existing development and redevelopment projects and our ability to locate attractive opportunities.

Shares of common stock may be purchased in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions.\nDistributions\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our board of directors declared distributions to stockholders and unitholders totaling approximately $105.0 million and $99.7 million, respectively. Existing cash balances, cash provided from operations and borrowings under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and dispositions were used to pay distributions during 2015 and 2014.\nThe payment of quarterly distributions is determined by our board of directors and may be adjusted at its discretion at any time. During February 2016, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.29 per share, payable on April 13, 2016 to stockholders of record as of April 2016.\nOutstanding Indebtedness\nAs of December 31, 2015, our outstanding indebtedness of approximately $1.6 billion consisted of mortgage notes, senior unsecured notes and bank unsecured credit facilities, excluding approximately $35.7 million representing our proportionate share of non-recourse debt associated with unconsolidated joint ventures. As of December 31, 2014, our outstanding indebtedness of approximately $1.4 billion consisted of mortgage notes, senior unsecured notes and bank unsecured credit facilities, excluding approximately $42.5 million representing our proportionate share of debt associated with unconsolidated joint ventures.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the gross book value of our consolidated properties was approximately $4.1 billion and the gross book value of all properties securing our mortgage debt was approximately $0.6 billion. As of December 31, 2014, the total gross book value of our consolidated properties was approximately $4.0 billion and the gross book value of all properties securing our mortgage debt was approximately $0.6 billion. Our debt has various covenants with which we were in compliance as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nOur debt instruments require monthly, quarterly or semiannual payments of interest and mortgages generally require monthly or quarterly repayments of principal. Currently, cash flows from our operations are sufficient to satisfy these debt service requirements and we anticipate that cash flows from operations will continue to be sufficient to satisfy our debt service excluding principal maturities, which we plan to fund from refinancing and/or new debt.\nAll of our senior unsecured notes contain certain cross-default provisions which may be triggered in the event that any material indebtedness is in default. These cross-default provisions may require us to repay such senior unsecured debt. We are not in default and do not have any unsecured debt maturities through April 2016.\nWe have certain non-recourse, secured loans which are cross-collateralized by multiple properties. In the event of a default, we may then be required to repay such indebtedness, together with applicable prepayment charges, to avoid foreclosure on all cross collateralized properties within the applicable pool. We generally have broad substitution rights that afford DCT the opportunity to replace encumbered properties with replacement properties. We are not in default and do not have any cross-collateralized debt maturing through April 2017.\nIn the event of default or foreclosure, or if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or meet our payment obligations, the amount of our distributable cash flows and our financial condition would be adversely affected.\nFinancing Strategy\nWe do not have a formal policy limiting the amount of debt we incur, although we currently intend to operate so that our financial metrics are generally consistent with investment grade peers in the real estate industry. We continually evaluate our secured and unsecured leverage and among other relevant metrics, our fixed charge coverage. Our charter and our bylaws do not limit the indebtedness that we may incur. We are, however, subject to certain covenants which may limit our outstanding indebtedness.\nDebt Issuances\nDuring 2015, we assumed two mortgage notes with aggregate outstanding balances of approximately $21.1 million in connection with property acquisitions. We recorded approximately a $1.9 million premium in connection with the assumption of these notes.\nOn April 8, 2015, we amended and restated our existing $225.0 million senior unsecured term loan and $300.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility with our syndicated bank group. The senior unsecured term loan was disaggregated into two tranches, $125.0 million and $100.0 million, with maturity dates of April 8, 2020 and April 8, 2017, respectively. The senior unsecured revolving credit facility's commitment was increased to $400.0 million with a maturity date of April 8, 2019.\nOn December 10, 2015, we entered into a $200.0 million variable rate senior unsecured term loan which matures on December 10, 2022. On December 11, 2015, we entered into a pay-fixed, receive-floating interest rate swap which effectively fixes the interest rate on the term loan at 3.31% through maturity, however, there is no floor on the variable interest rate of the swap whereas the current variable-rate debt is subject to a 0.0% floor. In the event that US LIBOR is negative, the Company would make payments to the hedge counterparty equal to the spread between US LIBOR and zero. We primarily used the proceeds to pay down the senior unsecured revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes.\nDebt Retirement\nDuring October 2015, we paid-off a $50.9 million note at par maturing in February 2016 using proceeds from the Company's senior unsecured revolving credit facility.\nLine of Credit\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $70.0 million outstanding and $326.5 million available under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility, net of one letter of credit totaling $3.5 million. As of December 31, 2014, we had $37.0 million outstanding and $243.5 million available under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility, net of three letters of credit totaling $19.5 million.\nThe senior unsecured revolving credit facility agreement contains various covenants with which we were in compliance as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nDebt Maturities\nThe following table presents the scheduled maturities of our debt and regularly scheduled principal amortization, excluding unamortized premiums, discounts and deferred loan costs, as of December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 267: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Senior\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Bank Unsecured\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Unsecured Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Mortgage Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Credit Facilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 99,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 105,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100,000\n</td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 192,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 81,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,747\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 88,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 46,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 70,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 167,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 71,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 125,000\n</td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 246,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 532,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 200,000\n</td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 761,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 860,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 206,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 495,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,561,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 268: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> The term loan facilities are presented in Senior unsecured notes\u201d in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table reflects our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015, specifically our obligations under long-term debt agreements, operating lease agreements and ground lease agreements (in thousands):\nTable 269: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2017 -

As used herein, the terms Company,\u201d we,\u201d our\u201d and us\u201d refer to DCT Industrial Trust Inc. and its subsidiaries, including its operating partnership, DCT Industrial Operating Partnership LP. When we use the term DCT\u201d or DCT Industrial,\u201d we are referring to DCT Industrial Trust Inc. by itself, and not including any of its subsidiaries, and when we use the term the Operating Partnership,\u201d we are referring to DCT Industrial Operating Partnership LP by itself, and not including any of its subsidiaries.\nDCT was formed as a Maryland corporation in April 2002 and has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We are structured as an umbrella partnership REIT under which substantially all of our current and future business is, and will be, conducted through a majority owned and controlled subsidiary, DCT Industrial Operating Partnership LP, a Delaware limited partnership, for which DCT is the sole general partner. DCT owns properties through the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2015, DCT owned approximately 95.6% of the outstanding equity interests in the Operating Partnership.\nOur primary business objectives are to maximize long-term growth in Funds From Operations, or FFO, as defined on page 34, net asset value of our portfolio and total shareholder returns. In our pursuit of these long-term objectives, we seek to:\n \u25cf maximize cash flows from existing properties; \n \u25cf deploy capital into quality acquisitions and development opportunities which meet our asset, location and financial criteria; and \n \u25cf recycle capital by selling assets that no longer fit our investment criteria and reinvesting the proceeds into higher growth opportunities. \nOutlook\nWe seek to maximize long-term earnings growth and value within the context of overall economic conditions, primarily through increasing occupancy, rents and operating income at existing properties and developing and acquiring high-quality properties with attractive operating income and value growth prospects. Fundamentals for industrial real estate continue to improve in response to general improvement in the economy as well as trends that particularly favor industrial assets, including the growth of e-commerce and U.S. based manufacturing. We expect moderate economic growth to continue through 2016, which should result in continued positive demand for warehouse space as companies expand and upgrade their distribution and production platforms.\nIn response to positive net absorption and lower market vacancy levels, rental rates are increasing in most of our markets. Rental concessions, such as free rent, have also declined in all markets. Consistent with recent experience and based on current market conditions, we expect average net effective rental rates on new leases signed during 2016 to be higher than the rates on expiring leases.\nNew development has begun to increase in many markets where fundamentals have improved, however construction remains below current levels of net absorption in most markets and below historical peak levels. We expect that the operating environment will continue to be favorable for owners and developers given our favorable outlook for strong market occupancy levels and rental rate growth.\nWe expect same store net operating income to be higher in 2016 than it was in 2015, primarily as a result of higher occupancy in 2016 and the impact of increasing rental rates on leases signed in 2016 compared to expiring leases.\nIn terms of capital investment, we will pursue the selective development of new buildings and the opportunistic acquisition of buildings in markets where we perceive demand and market rental rates will provide attractive financial returns.\nWe anticipate continuing to selectively dispose of non-strategic assets to fund our investment in new development and acquisitions in an effort to enhance long-term growth in net asset value, earnings and cash flows as well as to enhance the overall quality of our portfolio.\nWe anticipate having sufficient liquidity to fund our operating expenses, including costs to maintain our properties and distributions, though we may finance investments, including acquisitions and developments, with the issuance of new common shares, proceeds from asset sales or through additional borrowings. Please see Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for additional discussion.\nInflation\nThe U.S. economy has experienced low inflation over the past several years and as a result, inflation has not had a significant impact on our business. Moreover, most of our leases require the customers to pay their share of operating expenses, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation. In addition, most of our leases expire within five years which enables us to replace existing leases with new leases at then-existing market rates. While slowing global growth has the potential to dampen demand for distribution space, we have not yet seen any indications of this reduced demand.\nSummary of Significant Transactions and Activities During 2015\nSignificant transactions for the year ended December 31, 2015\n \u25cf Acquisitions \n \u25cf During the year ended December 31, 2015, we acquired 17 buildings comprising 2.4 million square feet in the Atlanta, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Miami, Northern California, Phoenix and Seattle markets for a total purchase price of approximately $153.1 million. Weighted average occupancy upon the acquisition of the properties was 75.7%. \n \u25cf Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2015, we acquired 271.9 acres of land in the Atlanta, Baltimore/Washington D.C., Chicago, Dallas, Miami, Northern California and Orlando markets for approximately $54.9 million that are held for future development. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2015, we acquired a parking lot located in a business park where we own several buildings. \n \u25cf Development Activities \n \u25cf As of December 31, 2015, construction was shell-complete on three buildings totaling 0.5 million square feet in the Houston, Miami and Seattle markets. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, we stabilized ten buildings totaling 3.0 million square feet. Additionally, we recognized development profit, net of taxes, of approximately $2.6 million related to the sales of 8th & Vineyard C, 8th & Vineyard D and 8th & Vineyard E to third-parties. \nThe

The building is not included in the table above; however, is classified as a property under development. See pages 22 and 23 for further information. \n (4) The Projected Investment does not include any potential promote payable to our joint venture partner. \n (5) Although we contributed 100% of the initial cash equity capital required by the venture, after return of certain preferential distributions on capital invested, profits and losses are generally split 50/50. \n \u25cf Dispositions \n \u25cf During the year ended December 31, 2015, we sold 30 consolidated operating properties, totaling 5.3 million square feet, located in our Atlanta, Houston, Indianapolis, Louisville, Memphis, New Jersey and Pennsylvania markets, to third-parties for gross proceeds of approximately $243.4 million. \n \u25cf We recognized gains of approximately $77.9 million on the disposition of 28 properties and recognized impairment losses of approximately $2.3 million on the disposition of two properties. \n \u25cf Significant Activity with Unconsolidated Joint Ventures \n \u25cf During August 2015, IDI/DCT, LLC sold its last property. We received approximately $14.0 million for our share of the gross proceeds and recognized our share of the gain on sale of approximately $3.7 million, which is included in Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures, net\u201d in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. \n \u25cf During August 2015, we purchased our partner's 25.0% interest in one land parcel from the IDI/DCT Buford, LLC joint venture for approximately $1.1 million. \n \u25cf Debt Activity \n \u25cf As of December 31, 2015, we had $70.0 million outstanding and $326.5 million available under our unsecured revolving credit facility, net of one letter of credit totaling $3.5 million. \n \u25cf During 2015, we assumed two mortgage notes with aggregate outstanding balances of approximately $21.1 million in connection with property acquisitions. We recorded approximately a $1.9 million premium in connection with the assumption of these notes. \n \u25cf On April 8, 2015, we amended and restated our existing $225.0 million senior unsecured term loan and $300.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility with our syndicated bank group. The senior unsecured term loan was disaggregated into two tranches, $125.0 million and $100.0 million, with maturity dates of April 8, 2020 and April 8, 2017, respectively. The senior unsecured revolving credit facility's commitment was increased to $400.0 million with a maturity date of April 8, 2019. \n \u25cf During October 2015, we paid-off a $50.9 million mortgage note maturing February 2016. \n \u25cf On December 10, 2015, we entered into a $200.0 million variable rate senior unsecured term loan which matures on December 10, 2022. On December 11, 2015, we entered into a pay-fixed, receive-floating interest rate swap which effectively fixes the interest rate on the term loan at 3.31% through maturity. We primarily used the proceeds to paydown the senior unsecured revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. \nOther Events\nIn May 2015, we determined that we had been the victim of a criminal fraud involving the impersonation of our Chief Executive Officer resulting in our transfer of $6.1 million to third-party overseas accounts. As a result of efforts working with our bank and federal law enforcement authorities, we have recovered approximately $3.0 million of the amount transferred. In addition, we have incurred $0.3 million of other costs related to the investigation of this incident. We filed a claim with our insurance carriers related to this incident and received $0.8 million in insurance proceeds as of December 31, 2015. Accordingly, during the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded an expense of $2.6 million in General and administrative\u201d expense related to this incident and the associated internal investigation. We do not expect any additional recoveries in the future.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nGeneral\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U. S. ( GAAP\u201d) requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different or different assumptions were made, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements. Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Estimates, judgments and assumptions are based on historical experiences that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. From time to time we re-evaluate those estimates and assumptions.\nThe Company's significant accounting policies are described in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d. These policies were followed in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 and are consistent with the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe Company has identified the following significant accounting policies as critical accounting policies. These accounting policies have the most significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, subjective and/or complex estimates.\nCapitalization of Costs\nSee the Company's accounting policy for Capitalization of Costs with respect to capitalization of project costs versus the expensing of repair and maintenance costs as described in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d. As described in our policy, we capitalize costs such as personnel, office and other expenses based on an estimate of the time spent on projects that are directly related to capital projects and acquisition of leases. Capitalized costs are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in construction in progress for each specific property.\nFor all development projects, the Company uses its professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred. The Company capitalizes interest, real estate taxes, insurance and payroll and costs associated with individuals directly responsible for and who spend their time on development activities. Capitalization is ceased upon substantial completion of the project. These costs are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in construction in progress for each specific property.\nAcquisition of Investment Properties\nThe Company allocates the purchase price of real estate to identifiable tangible assets such as land, building, land improvements and tenant improvements acquired based on their fair value. In estimating the fair value of each component management considers appraisals, replacement cost, its own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties, market rental data and other related information.\nImpairment of Properties\nThe Company periodically evaluates its long-lived assets, including investments in properties, for indicators of impairment. The judgements regarding the existence of indicators of impairment are based on the operating performance, market conditions, as well as the Company's ability to hold and its intent with regard to each property. The judgements regarding whether the carrying amounts of these assets may not be recoverable are based on estimates of future undiscounted cash flows from properties which include estimates of future operating performance and market conditions.\nImpairment of Investments in and Advances to Unconsolidated Joint Ventures\nThe Company evaluates investments in and advances to unconsolidated joint ventures for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that there may be an other-than-temporary decline in value. The judgments regarding other-than-temporary declines in value are based on operating performance, market conditions, the Company's ability to and intent to hold as well as its ability to influence significant decisions of the venture.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nDerivative instruments and hedging activities require management to make judgments regarding fair value, the nature of its derivatives and their effectiveness as hedges. These judgments determine if the changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are reported in our Consolidated Statement of Operations as a component of net income or as a component of comprehensive income and as a component of equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. While management believes its judgments are reasonable, a change in a derivative's effectiveness as a hedge could materially affect expenses, net income and equity.\nRevenue Recognition\nAt the inception of a new lease arrangement, including new leases that arise from amendments, we assess the terms and conditions to determine the proper lease classification. A lease arrangement is classified as an operating lease if none of the following criteria are met: (i) transfer of ownership to the lessee, (ii) lessee has a bargain purchase option during or at the end of the lease term, (iii) the lease term is equal to 75% or more of the underlying property's economic life, or (iv) the present value of future minimum lease payments (excluding executory costs) are equal to 90% or more of the excess estimated fair value (over retained investment tax credits) of the leased building. Generally, none of our leases meet any of the above criteria and, as such, are classified as operating leases. If the assumptions utilized in the above classification assessments were different, our lease classification for accounting purposes may have been different; thus the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would have been impacted, which may be material to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe recognize rental revenues on a straight-line basis under which contractual rent increases are recognized evenly over the lease term when collectability is reasonably assured and the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of the property.\nCertain properties have leases that provide for tenant occupancy during periods where no rent is due or where minimum rent payments change during the term of the lease. Accordingly, we record receivables from tenants that we expect to collect over the remaining lease term rather than currently, which are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a straight-line rent receivable.\nIf the lease provides for tenant improvements, we determine whether the tenant improvements are owned by the tenant or us. When we are the owner of the tenant improvements, the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the physical leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially completed. When the Company is the owner of the tenant improvements, any tenant improvements funded by the tenant are treated as lease payments which are deferred and amortized into income over the lease term. When the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements, we record any tenant improvement allowance funded as a lease incentive and amortize it as a reduction of revenue over the lease term.\nAbove and below market lease values for acquired properties are recorded as the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and management's estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease and amortized over the reasonably assured lease term.\nResults of Operations\nSummary of the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014\nWe are a leading industrial real estate company specializing in the acquisition, development, leasing and management of bulk distribution and light industrial properties located in high-volume distribution markets in the U.S. As of December 31, 2015, the Company owned interests in or had under development approximately 71.1 million square feet of properties leased to approximately 900 customers, including 7.5 million square feet managed on behalf of three institutional capital management joint venture partners. Also as of December 31, 2015, we consolidated 390 operating properties, three development properties, five redevelopment properties and four consolidated operating properties classified as held for sale. As of December 31, 2014, we consolidated 393 operating properties, seven development properties and six redevelopment properties. As of December 31, 2015, we had 327 properties in same store and 75 in non-same store consisting of properties that did not meet our same store definition, which includes 67 operating properties and eight development and redevelopment properties.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2015 to the year ended December 31, 2014\nThe following table presents the changes in rental revenues, rental expenses and real estate taxes, property net operating income, other revenue and other income and other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Our same store portfolio includes all operating properties that we owned for the entirety of both the current and prior year reporting periods. Developed properties are generally included in same store properties once they are stabilized. We generally consider buildings stabilized when occupancy reaches 90%. Non-same store operating properties include properties not meeting the same store criteria and exclude development and redevelopment properties. The same store portfolio for the periods presented totaled 327 operating properties and was comprised of 49.5 million square feet. A discussion of these changes follows in the table below (in thousands):\nTable 152: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td>

of above and below market rent intangibles, tenant recovery income, other rental revenues and early lease termination fees, increased $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due to the following changes:\n \u25cf $7.7 million increase in our non-same store rental revenues primarily as a result of an increase in the number of non-same store properties. Since January 1, 2014, we acquired 43 operating properties and placed into operation 22 development and redevelopment properties. \n \u25cf $10.6 million increase in total revenue in our same store portfolio primarily due to the following: \n \u25cf $10.0 million increase in base rent primarily resulting from increased rental rates, reduction of free rent concessions and a 100 basis point increase in average occupancy period over period; \n \u25cf $3.4 million increase in operating expense recoveries related to higher average occupancy and higher recovery of tenant improvement reimbursements; and \n \u25cf $1.4 million increase in other income from tenants due to move-out repairs, lease termination income and other rents; which was partially offset by \n \u25cf $3.9 million decrease in straight-line rental revenue; and \n \u25cf $0.4 million decrease in below market rent adjustments. \nThe following table presents the components of our consolidated rental revenues (in

and \n \u25cf $0.7 million decrease in rental expenses and real estate taxes related to our non-same store properties primarily due to a $1.7 million decrease in repairs and maintenance, other common area expenses and non-recoverable expenses, offset in part by a $1.0 million increase in real estate taxes. \nOther Revenue and Other Income\nTotal other revenue and other income increased $37.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due the following:\n \u25cf $38.2 million increase in gain on dispositions of real estate interests primarily related to gains of $77.9 million recognized on the disposition of 28 properties in the Atlanta, Houston, Indianapolis, Louisville, New Jersey and Pennsylvania markets during 2015, which was partially offset by a $0.9 million gain on the sale of our interest in the TRT-DCT Venture I and gains of $38.8 million from the sale of 32 properties during 2014; \n \u25cf $0.8 million increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures, net primarily related to $3.7 million of gain recognized on the sale of one property in the IDI/DCT, LLC joint venture during 2015, which was partially offset by lower equity in earnings due to the disposition of all of the properties in the TRT-DCT Venture I, our disposition of our unconsolidated interest in TRT-DCT Venture II and disposition of one property in the IDI/DCT, LLC Venture during 2014; and \n \u25cf $0.6 million increase in development profit, net of taxes, related to $2.6 million recognized from the completion and sale of three development projects totaling 156,000 square feet during 2015, which was offset by $2.0 million recognized from the sale and completion of two development projects totaling 229,000 square feet during 2014; which was partially offset by \n \u25cf $1.6 million decrease in interest and other income (expense) primarily related to a settlement on roof damages on several properties located in our Houston market during 2014; and \n \u25cf $1.0 million decrease in gain on business combination related to obtaining control through the purchase of our partner's 50.0% interest in one property from the IDI/DCT, LLC joint venture during 2014. \nOther Expenses\nOther expenses increased $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due to the following:\n \u25cf $7.0 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense resulting from a $20.9 million increase related to real estate acquisitions, developments placed in service and capital additions; partially offset by $11.5 million related to real estate dispositions and $2.4 million related to same store tenant improvements that were fully amortized during 2015; \n \u25cf $5.5 million increase in general and administrative expense due to the following: \n o $3.6 million in severance costs; \n o $2.9 million in increased personnel costs; and \n o $2.6 million increase resulting from criminal fraud and the investigation, see discussion under Significant Transactions and Activities - Other Events\u201d; which was offset in part by \n o $2.4 million increase in capitalized overhead as a result of increased development, leasing and other capital projects; \n o $1.1 million decrease in pre-acquisition costs due to 17 acquisitions during 2015 compared to 36 acquisitions during 2014; and \n o $0.1 million decrease in professional service costs; and \n \u25cf $1.0 million increase in income tax (benefit) expense as a result of increased income from properties within our TRS during 2015; which was partially offset by \n \u25cf $9.2 million decrease in interest expense as a result of a $6.8 million increase in capitalized interest in 2015 related to increased development activities, the repayment of a $43.3 million mortgage note in November 2014, the repayment of a $40.0 million 5 year private placement note in June 2015, the repayment of a $50.9 million mortgage note in October 2015 and an overall lower weighted average effective interest rate; and \n \u25cf $3.3 million decrease in impairment due to $5.6 million recognized on five properties sold or held for sale during 2014 compared to $2.3 million recognized on two properties sold during 2015. \nIncome from Discontinued Operations\nIncome from discontinued operations decreased by $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014. This decrease is primarily related to the classification of fewer assets as discontinued operations for the year period ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. See the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d for additional information related to the early adoption of the discontinued operations accounting standard update.\nSummary of the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013\nAs of December 31, 2014, we consolidated 393 operating properties, seven development properties and six redevelopment properties. As of December 31, 2013, we consolidated 395 operating properties, two development properties, two redevelopment properties and one property which was held for sale. As of December 31, 2014, we had 286 properties in same store and 120 in non-same store consisting of properties that did not meet our same store definition, which includes 116 operating properties and four development and redevelopment properties.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2014 to the year ended December 31, 2013\nThe following table presents the changes in rental revenues, rental expenses and real estate taxes, property net operating income, other revenue and other income and other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Our same store portfolio includes all operating properties that we owned for the entirety of both the current and prior year reporting periods. Developed properties are generally included in same store properties once they are stabilized. We generally consider buildings stabilized when occupancy reaches 90%. Non-same store operating properties include properties not meeting the same store criteria and exclude development and redevelopment properties. The same store portfolio for the periods presented totaled 286 operating properties and was comprised of 41.9 million square feet.

tenant recovery income, other rental revenues and early lease termination fees, increased $48.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013, primarily due to the following changes:\n \u25cf $41.4 million increase in our non-same store rental revenues primarily as a result of the increase in the number of non-same store properties. During the period January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2014 we acquired 67 operating properties and placed into operation 13 development and redevelopment properties. \n \u25cf $7.2 million increase in total revenue in our same store portfolio primarily due to the following: \n \u25cf $2.5 million increase in base rent primarily resulting from increased rental rates and increased average occupancy period over period; \n \u25cf $3.6 million increase in operating expense recoveries related to higher average occupancy and higher property operating expense; \n \u25cf $0.9 million increase in straight-line rental revenue; and \n \u25cf $0.3 million increase in other income from tenants due to move-out repairs, lease termination income and other rents. \nThe following table presents the

For the year ended December 31, 2014 fewer assets were classified as discontinued operations, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d for additional information related to the early adoption of the discontinued operations accounting standard update; and \n \u25cf $1.3 million increase in interest and other income primarily related to a settlement on roof damages on several properties located in our Houston market; which was partially offset by \n \u25cf $1.0 million decrease in institutional capital management and other fees primarily related to the sale of all properties in TRT-DCT Venture I and TRT-DCT Venture II. \nOther Expenses\nOther expenses increased $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013, primarily due to the following:\n \u25cf $19.0 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense resulting from a $11.9 million increase related to real estate acquisitions, developments placed into service and capital additions, and a $10.3 million increase related to same store properties, which was partially offset by $3.2 million related to real estate dispositions; \n \u25cf $5.6 million impairment losses recognized on five of our properties that were sold or held for sale during 2014; and \n \u25cf $1.1 million increase in general and administrative expenses due to the following: \n o $2.6 million in increased personnel costs; which was partially offset by \n o $1.5 million increase in capitalized overhead as a result of increased development, leasing and other capital activities. \nIncome from Discontinued Operations\nIncome from discontinued operations decreased by $21.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013. This decrease is primarily related to the classification of fewer assets as discontinued operations for the year period ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.

We expect to utilize the same sources of capital to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements.\nCash Flows\nYear ended December 31, 2015 compared to year ended December 31, 2014\nCash and cash equivalents\u201d were $18.4 million and $19.6 million as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $30.5 million to $200.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $170.0 million during the same period in 2014. This change was primarily due to an increase in property net operating income attributable to acquired properties and operating performance at existing properties.\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased $41.1 million to $218.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $259.6 million during the same period in 2014. This change was primarily due to a decrease of $176.5 million in cash outflows from acquisitions; partially offset by an increase of $47.9 million in cash outflows related to capital expenditures and development activities, as reflected in the table below, a decrease of $40.9 million in cash inflows from dispositions, a decrease of $37.2 million in cash inflows related to timing of 1031 proceeds received from dispositions and a decrease of $11.4 million in cash inflows from distributions of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures.\nWe pursue the acquisition of buildings and land and consider selective development of new buildings in markets where we perceive that demand and market rental rates will provide attractive financial returns. The amount of cash used related to acquisitions and development and redevelopment investments will vary from period to period based on a number of factors, including, among others, current and anticipated future market conditions impacting the desirability of investments, leasing results with respect to our existing development and redevelopment projects and our ability to locate attractive opportunities.

The Plan permits stockholders to acquire additional shares with quarterly dividends and to make additional cash investments to buy shares directly through our third party transfer agent. Shares of common stock may be purchased in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions.\nDistributions\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our board of directors declared distributions to stockholders and unitholders totaling approximately $105.0 million and $99.7 million, respectively. Existing cash balances, cash provided from operations and borrowings under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and dispositions were used to pay distributions during 2015 and 2014.\nThe payment of quarterly distributions is determined by our board of directors and may be adjusted at its discretion at any time. During February 2016, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.29 per share, payable on April 13, 2016 to stockholders of record as of April 2016.\nOutstanding Indebtedness\nAs of December 31, 2015, our outstanding indebtedness of approximately $1.6 billion consisted of mortgage notes, senior unsecured notes and bank unsecured credit facilities, excluding approximately $35.7 million representing our proportionate share of non-recourse debt associated with unconsolidated joint ventures. As of December 31, 2014, our outstanding indebtedness of approximately $1.4 billion consisted of mortgage notes, senior unsecured notes and bank unsecured credit facilities, excluding approximately $42.5 million representing our proportionate share of debt associated with unconsolidated joint ventures.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the gross book value of our consolidated properties was approximately $4.1 billion and the gross book value of all properties securing our mortgage debt was approximately $0.6 billion. As of December 31, 2014, the total gross book value of our consolidated properties was approximately $4.0 billion and the gross book value of all properties securing our mortgage debt was approximately $0.6 billion. Our debt has various covenants with which we were in compliance as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nOur debt instruments require monthly, quarterly or semiannual payments of interest and mortgages generally require monthly or quarterly repayments of principal. Currently, cash flows from our operations are sufficient to satisfy these debt service requirements and we anticipate that cash flows from operations will continue to be sufficient to satisfy our debt service excluding principal maturities, which we plan to fund from refinancing and/or new debt.\nAll of our senior unsecured notes contain certain cross-default provisions which may be triggered in the event that any material indebtedness is in default. These cross-default provisions may require us to repay such senior unsecured debt. We are not in default and do not have any unsecured debt maturities through April 2016.\nWe have certain non-recourse, secured loans which are cross-collateralized by multiple properties. In the event of a default, we may then be required to repay such indebtedness, together with applicable prepayment charges, to avoid foreclosure on all cross collateralized properties within the applicable pool. We generally have broad substitution rights that afford DCT the opportunity to replace encumbered properties with replacement properties. We are not in default and do not have any cross-collateralized debt maturing through April 2017.\nIn the event of default or foreclosure, or if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or meet our payment obligations, the amount of our distributable cash flows and our financial condition would be adversely affected.\nFinancing Strategy\nWe do not have a formal policy limiting the amount of debt we incur, although we currently intend to operate so that our financial metrics are generally consistent with investment grade peers in the real estate industry. We continually evaluate our secured and unsecured leverage and among other relevant metrics, our fixed charge coverage. Our charter and our bylaws do not limit the indebtedness that we may incur. We are, however, subject to certain covenants which may limit our outstanding indebtedness.\nDebt Issuances\nDuring 2015, we assumed two mortgage notes with aggregate outstanding balances of approximately $21.1 million in connection with property acquisitions. We recorded approximately a $1.9 million premium in connection with the assumption of these notes.\nOn April 8, 2015, we amended and restated our existing $225.0 million senior unsecured term loan and $300.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility with our syndicated bank group. The senior unsecured term loan was disaggregated into two tranches, $125.0 million and $100.0 million, with maturity dates of April 8, 2020 and April 8, 2017, respectively. The senior unsecured revolving credit facility's commitment was increased to $400.0 million with a maturity date of April 8, 2019.\nOn December 10, 2015, we entered into a $200.0 million variable rate senior unsecured term loan which matures on December 10, 2022. On December 11, 2015, we entered into a pay-fixed, receive-floating interest rate swap which effectively fixes the interest rate on the term loan at 3.31% through maturity, however, there is no floor on the variable interest rate of the swap whereas the current variable-rate debt is subject to a 0.0% floor. In the event that US LIBOR is negative, the Company would make payments to the hedge counterparty equal to the spread between US LIBOR and zero. We primarily used the proceeds to pay down the senior unsecured revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes.\nDebt Retirement\nDuring October 2015, we paid-off a $50.9 million note at par maturing in February 2016 using proceeds from the Company's senior unsecured revolving credit facility.\nLine of Credit\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $70.0 million outstanding and $326.5 million available under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility, net of one letter of credit totaling $3.5 million. As of December 31, 2014, we had $37.0 million outstanding and $243.5 million available under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility, net of three letters of credit totaling $19.5 million.\nThe senior unsecured revolving credit facility agreement contains various covenants with which we were in compliance as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nDebt Maturities\nThe following table presents the scheduled maturities of our debt and regularly scheduled principal amortization, excluding unamortized premiums, discounts and deferred loan costs, as of December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 267: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Senior\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Bank Unsecured\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Unsecured Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Mortgage Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Credit Facilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 99,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 105,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100,000\n</td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 192,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 81,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,747\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 88,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 46,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 70,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 167,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 71,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 125,000\n</td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 246,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 532,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 200,000\n</td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 761,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 860,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 206,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 495,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,561,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) The term loan facilities are presented in Senior unsecured notes\u201d in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. \nContractual Obligations\nThe following table reflects our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015, specifically our obligations under long-term debt agreements, operating lease agreements and ground lease agreements (in thousands):\nTable 269: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2017 -

As used herein, the terms Company,\u201d we,\u201d our\u201d and us\u201d refer to DCT Industrial Trust Inc. and its subsidiaries, including its operating partnership, DCT Industrial Operating Partnership LP. When we use the term DCT\u201d or DCT Industrial,\u201d we are referring to DCT Industrial Trust Inc. by itself, and not including any of its subsidiaries, and when we use the term the Operating Partnership,\u201d we are referring to DCT Industrial Operating Partnership LP by itself, and not including any of its subsidiaries.\nDCT was formed as a Maryland corporation in April 2002 and has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We are structured as an umbrella partnership REIT under which substantially all of our current and future business is, and will be, conducted through a majority owned and controlled subsidiary, DCT Industrial Operating Partnership LP, a Delaware limited partnership, for which DCT is the sole general partner. DCT owns properties through the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2015, DCT owned approximately 95.6% of the outstanding equity interests in the Operating Partnership.\nOur primary business objectives are to maximize long-term growth in Funds From Operations, or FFO, as defined on page 34, net asset value of our portfolio and total shareholder returns. In our pursuit of these long-term objectives, we seek to:\n \u25cf maximize cash flows from existing properties; \n \u25cf deploy capital into quality acquisitions and development opportunities which meet our asset, location and financial criteria; and \n \u25cf recycle capital by selling assets that no longer fit our investment criteria and reinvesting the proceeds into higher growth opportunities. \nOutlook\nWe seek to maximize long-term earnings growth and value within the context of overall economic conditions, primarily through increasing occupancy, rents and operating income at existing properties and developing and acquiring high-quality properties with attractive operating income and value growth prospects. Fundamentals for industrial real estate continue to improve in response to general improvement in the economy as well as trends that particularly favor industrial assets, including the growth of e-commerce and U.S. based manufacturing. We expect moderate economic growth to continue through 2016, which should result in continued positive demand for warehouse space as companies expand and upgrade their distribution and production platforms.\nIn response to positive net absorption and lower market vacancy levels, rental rates are increasing in most of our markets. Rental concessions, such as free rent, have also declined in all markets. Consistent with recent experience and based on current market conditions, we expect average net effective rental rates on new leases signed during 2016 to be higher than the rates on expiring leases.\nNew development has begun to increase in many markets where fundamentals have improved, however construction remains below current levels of net absorption in most markets and below historical peak levels. We expect that the operating environment will continue to be favorable for owners and developers given our favorable outlook for strong market occupancy levels and rental rate growth.\nWe expect same store net operating income to be higher in 2016 than it was in 2015, primarily as a result of higher occupancy in 2016 and the impact of increasing rental rates on leases signed in 2016 compared to expiring leases.\nIn terms of capital investment, we will pursue the selective development of new buildings and the opportunistic acquisition of buildings in markets where we perceive demand and market rental rates will provide attractive financial returns.\nWe anticipate continuing to selectively dispose of non-strategic assets to fund our investment in new development and acquisitions in an effort to enhance long-term growth in net asset value, earnings and cash flows as well as to enhance the overall quality of our portfolio.\nWe anticipate having sufficient liquidity to fund our operating expenses, including costs to maintain our properties and distributions, though we may finance investments, including acquisitions and developments, with the issuance of new common shares, proceeds from asset sales or through additional borrowings. Please see Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for additional discussion.\nInflation\nThe U.S. economy has experienced low inflation over the past several years and as a result, inflation has not had a significant impact on our business. Moreover, most of our leases require the customers to pay their share of operating expenses, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation. In addition, most of our leases expire within five years which enables us to replace existing leases with new leases at then-existing market rates. While slowing global growth has the potential to dampen demand for distribution space, we have not yet seen any indications of this reduced demand.\nSummary of Significant Transactions and Activities During 2015\nSignificant transactions for the year ended December 31, 2015\n \u25cf Acquisitions \n \u25cf During the year ended December 31, 2015, we acquired 17 buildings comprising 2.4 million square feet in the Atlanta, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Miami, Northern California, Phoenix and Seattle markets for a total purchase price of approximately $153.1 million. Weighted average occupancy upon the acquisition of the properties was 75.7%. \n \u25cf Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2015, we acquired 271.9 acres of land in the Atlanta, Baltimore/Washington D.C., Chicago, Dallas, Miami, Northern California and Orlando markets for approximately $54.9 million that are held for future development. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2015, we acquired a parking lot located in a business park where we own several buildings. \n \u25cf Development Activities \n \u25cf As of December 31, 2015, construction was shell-complete on three buildings totaling 0.5 million square feet in the Houston, Miami and Seattle markets. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, we stabilized ten buildings totaling 3.0 million square feet. Additionally, we recognized development profit, net of taxes, of approximately $2.6 million related to the sales of 8th & Vineyard C, 8th & Vineyard D and 8th & Vineyard E to third-parties. \nThe table below reflects a summary of development activities as of December 31, 2015:\n\n (1) The completion date represents the date of building shell-completion or estimated date of shell-completion. \n (2) Percentage leased is computed as of the date the financial statements were available to be issued. \n (3) During November 2015, DCT acquired one building totaling 54,000 square feet in Miami that was shell-complete. The building is not included in the table above; however, is classified as a property under development. See pages 22 and 23 for further information. \n (4) The Projected Investment does not include any potential promote payable to our joint venture partner. \n (5) Although we contributed 100% of the initial cash equity capital required by the venture, after return of certain preferential distributions on capital invested, profits and losses are generally split 50/50. \n \u25cf Dispositions \n \u25cf During the year ended December 31, 2015, we sold 30 consolidated operating properties, totaling 5.3 million square feet, located in our Atlanta, Houston, Indianapolis, Louisville, Memphis, New Jersey and Pennsylvania markets, to third-parties for gross proceeds of approximately $243.4 million. \n \u25cf We recognized gains of approximately $77.9 million on the disposition of 28 properties and recognized impairment losses of approximately $2.3 million on the disposition of two properties. \n \u25cf Significant Activity with Unconsolidated Joint Ventures \n \u25cf During August 2015, IDI/DCT, LLC sold its last property. We received approximately $14.0 million for our share of the gross proceeds and recognized our share of the gain on sale of approximately $3.7 million, which is included in Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures, net\u201d in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. \n \u25cf During August 2015, we purchased our partner's 25.0% interest in one land parcel from the IDI/DCT Buford, LLC joint venture for approximately $1.1 million. \n \u25cf Debt Activity \n \u25cf As of December 31, 2015, we had $70.0 million outstanding and $326.5 million available under our unsecured revolving credit facility, net of one letter of credit totaling $3.5 million. \n \u25cf During 2015, we assumed two mortgage notes with aggregate outstanding balances of approximately $21.1 million in connection with property acquisitions. We recorded approximately a $1.9 million premium in connection with the assumption of these notes. \n \u25cf On April 8, 2015, we amended and restated our existing $225.0 million senior unsecured term loan and $300.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility with our syndicated bank group. The senior unsecured term loan was disaggregated into two tranches, $125.0 million and $100.0 million, with maturity dates of April 8, 2020 and April 8, 2017, respectively. The senior unsecured revolving credit facility's commitment was increased to $400.0 million with a maturity date of April 8, 2019. \n \u25cf During October 2015, we paid-off a $50.9 million mortgage note maturing February 2016. \n \u25cf On December 10, 2015, we entered into a $200.0 million variable rate senior unsecured term loan which matures on December 10, 2022. On December 11, 2015, we entered into a pay-fixed, receive-floating interest rate swap which effectively fixes the interest rate on the term loan at 3.31% through maturity. We primarily used the proceeds to paydown the senior unsecured revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. \nOther Events\nIn May 2015, we determined that we had been the victim of a criminal fraud involving the impersonation of our Chief Executive Officer resulting in our transfer of $6.1 million to third-party overseas accounts. As a result of efforts working with our bank and federal law enforcement authorities, we have recovered approximately $3.0 million of the amount transferred. In addition, we have incurred $0.3 million of other costs related to the investigation of this incident. We filed a claim with our insurance carriers related to this incident and received $0.8 million in insurance proceeds as of December 31, 2015. Accordingly, during the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded an expense of $2.6 million in General and administrative\u201d expense related to this incident and the associated internal investigation. We do not expect any additional recoveries in the future.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nGeneral\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U. S. ( GAAP\u201d) requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different or different assumptions were made, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements. Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Estimates, judgments and assumptions are based on historical experiences that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. From time to time we re-evaluate those estimates and assumptions.\nThe Company's significant accounting policies are described in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d. These policies were followed in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 and are consistent with the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe Company has identified the following significant accounting policies as critical accounting policies. These accounting policies have the most significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, subjective and/or complex estimates.\nCapitalization of Costs\nSee the Company's accounting policy for Capitalization of Costs with respect to capitalization of project costs versus the expensing of repair and maintenance costs as described in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d. As described in our policy, we capitalize costs such as personnel, office and other expenses based on an estimate of the time spent on projects that are directly related to capital projects and acquisition of leases. Capitalized costs are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in construction in progress for each specific property.\nFor all development projects, the Company uses its professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred. The Company capitalizes interest, real estate taxes, insurance and payroll and costs associated with individuals directly responsible for and who spend their time on development activities. Capitalization is ceased upon substantial completion of the project. These costs are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in construction in progress for each specific property.\nAcquisition of Investment Properties\nThe Company allocates the purchase price of real estate to identifiable tangible assets such as land, building, land improvements and tenant improvements acquired based on their fair value. In estimating the fair value of each component management considers appraisals, replacement cost, its own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties, market rental data and other related information.\nImpairment of Properties\nThe Company periodically evaluates its long-lived assets, including investments in properties, for indicators of impairment. The judgements regarding the existence of indicators of impairment are based on the operating performance, market conditions, as well as the Company's ability to hold and its intent with regard to each property. The judgements regarding whether the carrying amounts of these assets may not be recoverable are based on estimates of future undiscounted cash flows from properties which include estimates of future operating performance and market conditions.\nImpairment of Investments in and Advances to Unconsolidated Joint Ventures\nThe Company evaluates investments in and advances to unconsolidated joint ventures for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that there may be an other-than-temporary decline in value. The judgments regarding other-than-temporary declines in value are based on operating performance, market conditions, the Company's ability to and intent to hold as well as its ability to influence significant decisions of the venture.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nDerivative instruments and hedging activities require management to make judgments regarding fair value, the nature of its derivatives and their effectiveness as hedges. These judgments determine if the changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are reported in our Consolidated Statement of Operations as a component of net income or as a component of comprehensive income and as a component of equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. While management believes its judgments are reasonable, a change in a derivative's effectiveness as a hedge could materially affect expenses, net income and equity.\nRevenue Recognition\nAt the inception of a new lease arrangement, including new leases that arise from amendments, we assess the terms and conditions to determine the proper lease classification. A lease arrangement is classified as an operating lease if none of the following criteria are met: (i) transfer of ownership to the lessee, (ii) lessee has a bargain purchase option during or at the end of the lease term, (iii) the lease term is equal to 75% or more of the underlying property's economic life, or (iv) the present value of future minimum lease payments (excluding executory costs) are equal to 90% or more of the excess estimated fair value (over retained investment tax credits) of the leased building. Generally, none of our leases meet any of the above criteria and, as such, are classified as operating leases. If the assumptions utilized in the above classification assessments were different, our lease classification for accounting purposes may have been different; thus the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would have been impacted, which may be material to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe recognize rental revenues on a straight-line basis under which contractual rent increases are recognized evenly over the lease term when collectability is reasonably assured and the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of the property.\nCertain properties have leases that provide for tenant occupancy during periods where no rent is due or where minimum rent payments change during the term of the lease. Accordingly, we record receivables from tenants that we expect to collect over the remaining lease term rather than currently, which are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a straight-line rent receivable.\nIf the lease provides for tenant improvements, we determine whether the tenant improvements are owned by the tenant or us. When we are the owner of the tenant improvements, the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the physical leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially completed. When the Company is the owner of the tenant improvements, any tenant improvements funded by the tenant are treated as lease payments which are deferred and amortized into income over the lease term. When the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements, we record any tenant improvement allowance funded as a lease incentive and amortize it as a reduction of revenue over the lease term.\nAbove and below market lease values for acquired properties are recorded as the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and management's estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease and amortized over the reasonably assured lease term.\nResults of Operations\nSummary of the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014\nWe are a leading industrial real estate company specializing in the acquisition, development, leasing and management of bulk distribution and light industrial properties located in high-volume distribution markets in the U.S. As of December 31, 2015, the Company owned interests in or had under development approximately 71.1 million square feet of properties leased to approximately 900 customers, including 7.5 million square feet managed on behalf of three institutional capital management joint venture partners. Also as of December 31, 2015, we consolidated 390 operating properties, three development properties, five redevelopment properties and four consolidated operating properties classified as held for sale. As of December 31, 2014, we consolidated 393 operating properties, seven development properties and six redevelopment properties. As of December 31, 2015, we had 327 properties in same store and 75 in non-same store consisting of properties that did not meet our same store definition, which includes 67 operating properties and eight development and redevelopment properties.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2015 to the year ended December 31, 2014\nThe following table presents the changes in rental revenues, rental expenses and real estate taxes, property net operating income, other revenue and other income and other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Our same store portfolio includes all operating properties that we owned for the entirety of both the current and prior year reporting periods. Developed properties are generally included in same store properties once they are stabilized. We generally consider buildings stabilized when occupancy reaches 90%. Non-same store operating properties include properties not meeting the same store criteria and exclude development and redevelopment properties. The same store portfolio for the periods presented totaled 327 operating properties and was comprised of 49.5 million square feet. A discussion of these changes follows in the table below (in thousands):\n\n (1) For a discussion as to why we view property net operating income to be an appropriate supplemental performance measure and a reconciliation of our property net operating income to our reported Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations,\u201d see page 34. \nRental Revenues and Leasing Activity\nRental revenues, which are comprised of base rent, straight-line rent, amortization of above and below market rent intangibles, tenant recovery income, other rental revenues and early lease termination fees, increased $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due to the following changes:\n \u25cf $7.7 million increase in our non-same store rental revenues primarily as a result of an increase in the number of non-same store properties. Since January 1, 2014, we acquired 43 operating properties and placed into operation 22 development and redevelopment properties. \n \u25cf $10.6 million increase in total revenue in our same store portfolio primarily due to the following: \n \u25cf $10.0 million increase in base rent primarily resulting from increased rental rates, reduction of free rent concessions and a 100 basis point increase in average occupancy period over period; \n \u25cf $3.4 million increase in operating expense recoveries related to higher average occupancy and higher recovery of tenant improvement reimbursements; and \n \u25cf $1.4 million increase in other income from tenants due to move-out repairs, lease termination income and other rents; which was partially offset by \n \u25cf $3.9 million decrease in straight-line rental revenue; and \n \u25cf $0.4 million decrease in below market rent adjustments. \nThe following table presents the components of our consolidated rental revenues (in thousands):\n\nThe following table provides a summary of our leasing activity for the year ended December 31, 2015:\n\n (1) Excludes month to month leases. \n (2) Net effective rent is the average base rent calculated in accordance with GAAP, over the term of the lease. \n (3) GAAP basis rent growth is an annual ratio of the change in net effective rent (including straight-line rent adjustments as required by GAAP) compared to the net effective rent of the comparable lease. Leases where there were no prior comparable leases due to materially different lease structures are excluded. \n (4) Assumes no exercise of lease renewal options, if any. \n (5) Turnover costs are comprised of the costs incurred or capitalized for improvements of vacant and renewal spaces, as well as the commissions paid and indirect costs capitalized for leasing transactions. Turnover costs per square foot represent the total turnover costs expected to be incurred on the leases signed during the period and do not reflect actual expenditures for the period. \n (6) Represents the percentage of customers renewing their respective leases weighted by average square feet. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we signed 126 leases comprising 11.6 million square feet with total concessions of $17.6 million primarily related to free rent periods.\nRental Expenses and Real Estate Taxes\nRental expenses and real estate taxes decreased by $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due to the following:\n \u25cf $1.4 million decrease in rental expenses and real estate taxes period over period in our same store portfolio, which was primarily due to a $2.7 million decrease in repairs and maintenance, insurance and non-recoverable expenses, offset in part by a $1.4 million increase in real estate taxes; and \n \u25cf $0.7 million decrease in rental expenses and real estate taxes related to our non-same store properties primarily due to a $1.7 million decrease in repairs and maintenance, other common area expenses and non-recoverable expenses, offset in part by a $1.0 million increase in real estate taxes. \nOther Revenue and Other Income\nTotal other revenue and other income increased $37.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due the following:\n \u25cf $38.2 million increase in gain on dispositions of real estate interests primarily related to gains of $77.9 million recognized on the disposition of 28 properties in the Atlanta, Houston, Indianapolis, Louisville, New Jersey and Pennsylvania markets during 2015, which was partially offset by a $0.9 million gain on the sale of our interest in the TRT-DCT Venture I and gains of $38.8 million from the sale of 32 properties during 2014; \n \u25cf $0.8 million increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures, net primarily related to $3.7 million of gain recognized on the sale of one property in the IDI/DCT, LLC joint venture during 2015, which was partially offset by lower equity in earnings due to the disposition of all of the properties in the TRT-DCT Venture I, our disposition of our unconsolidated interest in TRT-DCT Venture II and disposition of one property in the IDI/DCT, LLC Venture during 2014; and \n \u25cf $0.6 million increase in development profit, net of taxes, related to $2.6 million recognized from the completion and sale of three development projects totaling 156,000 square feet during 2015, which was offset by $2.0 million recognized from the sale and completion of two development projects totaling 229,000 square feet during 2014; which was partially offset by \n \u25cf $1.6 million decrease in interest and other income (expense) primarily related to a settlement on roof damages on several properties located in our Houston market during 2014; and \n \u25cf $1.0 million decrease in gain on business combination related to obtaining control through the purchase of our partner's 50.0% interest in one property from the IDI/DCT, LLC joint venture during 2014. \nOther Expenses\nOther expenses increased $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due to the following:\n \u25cf $7.0 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense resulting from a $20.9 million increase related to real estate acquisitions, developments placed in service and capital additions; partially offset by $11.5 million related to real estate dispositions and $2.4 million related to same store tenant improvements that were fully amortized during 2015; \n \u25cf $5.5 million increase in general and administrative expense due to the following: \n o $3.6 million in severance costs; \n o $2.9 million in increased personnel costs; and \n o $2.6 million increase resulting from criminal fraud and the investigation, see discussion under Significant Transactions and Activities - Other Events\u201d; which was offset in part by \n o $2.4 million increase in capitalized overhead as a result of increased development, leasing and other capital projects; \n o $1.1 million decrease in pre-acquisition costs due to 17 acquisitions during 2015 compared to 36 acquisitions during 2014; and \n o $0.1 million decrease in professional service costs; and \n \u25cf $1.0 million increase in income tax (benefit) expense as a result of increased income from properties within our TRS during 2015; which was partially offset by \n \u25cf $9.2 million decrease in interest expense as a result of a $6.8 million increase in capitalized interest in 2015 related to increased development activities, the repayment of a $43.3 million mortgage note in November 2014, the repayment of a $40.0 million 5 year private placement note in June 2015, the repayment of a $50.9 million mortgage note in October 2015 and an overall lower weighted average effective interest rate; and \n \u25cf $3.3 million decrease in impairment due to $5.6 million recognized on five properties sold or held for sale during 2014 compared to $2.3 million recognized on two properties sold during 2015. \nIncome from Discontinued Operations\nIncome from discontinued operations decreased by $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014. This decrease is primarily related to the classification of fewer assets as discontinued operations for the year period ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. See the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d for additional information related to the early adoption of the discontinued operations accounting standard update.\nSummary of the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013\nAs of December 31, 2014, we consolidated 393 operating properties, seven development properties and six redevelopment properties. As of December 31, 2013, we consolidated 395 operating properties, two development properties, two redevelopment properties and one property which was held for sale. As of December 31, 2014, we had 286 properties in same store and 120 in non-same store consisting of properties that did not meet our same store definition, which includes 116 operating properties and four development and redevelopment properties.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2014 to the year ended December 31, 2013\nThe following table presents the changes in rental revenues, rental expenses and real estate taxes, property net operating income, other revenue and other income and other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Our same store portfolio includes all operating properties that we owned for the entirety of both the current and prior year reporting periods. Developed properties are generally included in same store properties once they are stabilized. We generally consider buildings stabilized when occupancy reaches 90%. Non-same store operating properties include properties not meeting the same store criteria and exclude development and redevelopment properties. The same store portfolio for the periods presented totaled 286 operating properties and was comprised of 41.9 million square feet.

For the year ended December 31, 2014 fewer assets were classified as discontinued operations, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d for additional information related to the early adoption of the discontinued operations accounting standard update; and \n \u25cf $1.3 million increase in interest and other income primarily related to a settlement on roof damages on several properties located in our Houston market; which was partially offset by \n \u25cf $1.0 million decrease in institutional capital management and other fees primarily related to the sale of all properties in TRT-DCT Venture I and TRT-DCT Venture II. \nOther Expenses\nOther expenses increased $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013, primarily due to the following:\n \u25cf $19.0 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense resulting from a $11.9 million increase related to real estate acquisitions, developments placed into service and capital additions, and a $10.3 million increase related to same store properties, which was partially offset by $3.2 million related to real estate dispositions; \n \u25cf $5.6 million impairment losses recognized on five of our properties that were sold or held for sale during 2014; and \n \u25cf $1.1 million increase in general and administrative expenses due to the following: \n o $2.6 million in increased personnel costs; which was partially offset by \n o $1.5 million increase in capitalized overhead as a result of increased development, leasing and other capital activities. \nIncome from Discontinued Operations\nIncome from discontinued operations decreased by $21.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013. This decrease is primarily related to the classification of fewer assets as discontinued operations for the year period ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. See the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d for additional information related to the early adoption of the discontinued operations accounting standard update.\nSegment Summary for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013\nThe Company's segments are based on our internal reporting of operating results used to assess performance based on our properties' geographical markets. Our markets are aggregated into three reportable regions or segments, East, Central and West, which are based on the geographical locations of our properties. These regions are comprised of the markets by which management and their operating teams conduct and monitor business (see further detail on our Segments in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 11 - Segment Information\u201d). Management considers rental revenues and property net operating income aggregated by segment to be the appropriate way to analyze performance.\nThe following table presents the changes in our consolidated properties in continuing operations by segment (dollar amounts and square feet in thousands):\n\n (1) Segment assets include all assets comprising operating properties included in a segment, less non-segment cash and cash equivalents, other non-segment assets, and assets held for sale that meet the definition of a discontinued operation. The prior year segment assets are not restated for current year discontinued operations. \n (2) Segment rental revenues include revenue from operating properties and development properties. Properties classified as discontinued operations are not included in these results. \n (3) For a discussion as to why we view property net operating income to be an appropriate supplemental performance measure and a reconciliation of our property net operating income to our reported Income (loss) from Continuing Operations,\u201d see page 34. \nThe following table presents our total assets, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization, by segment (in thousands):\n\n (1) Other non-segment assets primarily consists of investments in and advances to unconsolidated joint ventures, deferred loan costs, other receivables and other assets. \n (2) Represents assets held for sale that meet the definition of a discontinued operation. \nEast Segment\n \u25cf East Segment assets increased by approximately $24.6 million in 2015 primarily due to the acquisition of four properties, completion of development or redevelopment on four operating properties and acquisition of five land parcels since December 31, 2014, partially offset by the disposition of 19 properties. \n \u25cf East Segment assets decreased by approximately $16.2 million in 2014 primarily due to depreciation and amortization expense and the disposition of 12 properties since December 31, 2013. \n \u25cf East Segment property NOI decreased approximately $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014, primarily as a result of: \n \u25cf $5.3 million decrease in rental revenues, of which $13.8 million is attributed to property dispositions, which was partially offset by a $5.8 million increase attributed to the timing of property acquisitions and a $2.7 million increase attributed to higher operating expense recoveries and increased occupancy at properties in our same store portfolio; which was partially offset by \n \u25cf $3.6 million decrease in operating expenses primarily related to lower property taxes and maintenance expense. \n \u25cf East Segment property NOI, after reclassification for discontinued operations, increased approximately $12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013, primarily as a result of: \n \u25cf $15.9 million increase in rental revenues, of which $12.0 million is attributed to real estate acquisitions and $5.4 million is attributed to increased occupancy in our same store portfolio, which was partially offset by $1.5 million of real estate dispositions; which was partially offset by \n \u25cf $3.8 million increase in operating expenses related to increased property taxes and snow removal costs incurred from severe winter storms during 2014. \nCentral Segment\n \u25cf Central Segment assets increased by approximately $24.7 million in 2015 due to the acquisition of three properties, completion of development on five properties and acquisition of five land parcels since December 31, 2014, partially offset by the disposition of 11 properties. \n \u25cf Central Segment assets increased by approximately $32.8 million in 2014 due to the acquisition of 15 properties, completion of development on four properties and acquisition of four land parcels since December 31, 2013, partially offset by the disposition of 25 properties, including the disposition of our entire Columbus portfolio. \n \u25cf Central Segment property NOI increased approximately $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014, primarily as a result of: \n \u25cf $2.2 million increase in rental revenues, of which $14.8 million is attributed to the timing of property acquisitions and the completion of developments and $3.1 million is attributed to higher operating expense recoveries at properties in our same store portfolio, which was offset in part by a $15.7 million decrease attributed to property dispositions; and \n \u25cf $2.6 million decrease in operating expenses primarily related to prior year bad debt expenses and snow removal costs incurred from severe winter storms during 2014. \n \u25cf Central Segment property NOI, after reclassification for discontinued operations, increased approximately $11.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013 primarily as a result of: \n \u25cf $17.6 million increase in rental revenues, of which $17.0 million is attributed to real estate acquisitions and leasing of developments, and $2.7 million is attributed to increased occupancy in our same store portfolio, which was partially offset by $2.1 million of real estate dispositions; which was partially offset by \n \u25cf $6.6 million increase in operating expenses primarily related to increased property taxes and snow removal costs incurred from severe winter storms during 2014. \nWest Segment\n \u25cf West Segment assets increased by approximately $119.5 million in 2015 due to the acquisition of ten properties, completion of development or redevelopment on seven properties and acquisition of one land parcel, partially offset by the disposition of one property since December 31, 2014. \n \u25cf West Segment assets increased by approximately $227.7 million in 2014 due to the acquisition of 17 properties, completion of development on eight properties and acquisition of two land parcels since December 31, 2013. \n \u25cf West Segment property NOI increased approximately $17.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014 primarily as a result of: \n \u25cf $21.4 million increase in rental revenues, of which $16.7 million is attributed to the timing of property acquisitions and the completion of developments and $4.7 million is attributed to higher operating expense recoveries at properties in our same store portfolio; which was partially offset by \n \u25cf $4.1 million increase in operating expenses primarily comprised of increased property taxes due to the completion of developments and real estate acquisitions. \n \u25cf West Segment property NOI, after reclassification for discontinued operations, increased approximately $11.2 million, for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013 primarily as a result of: \n \u25cf $15.1 million increase in rental revenues, of which $14.8 million is attributed to real estate acquisitions and leasing of developments, and $0.3 million attributed to increased occupancy in our same store portfolio; which was partially offset by \n \u25cf $3.9 million increase in operating expenses primarily comprised of increased property taxes and property insurance, driven by property acquisitions and developments placed in service. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nWe currently expect that our principal sources of working capital and funding for potential capital requirements for expansions and renovation of properties, developments, acquisitions, and debt service and distributions to shareholders will include:\n \u25cf Cash flows from operations; \n \u25cf Proceeds from dispositions; \n \u25cf Borrowings under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility; \n \u25cf Other forms of secured or unsecured financings; \n \u25cf Offerings of common stock or other securities; \n \u25cf Current cash balances; and \n \u25cf Distributions from institutional capital management and other joint ventures. \nOur sources of capital will be used to meet our liquidity requirements and capital commitments, including operating activities, debt service obligations, equity holder distributions, capital expenditures at our properties, development funding requirements and future acquisitions. We expect to utilize the same sources of capital to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements.\nCash Flows\nYear ended December 31, 2015 compared to year ended December 31, 2014\nCash and cash equivalents\u201d were $18.4 million and $19.6 million as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $30.5 million to $200.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $170.0 million during the same period in 2014. This change was primarily due to an increase in property net operating income attributable to acquired properties and operating performance at existing properties.\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased $41.1 million to $218.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $259.6 million during the same period in 2014. This change was primarily due to a decrease of $176.5 million in cash outflows from acquisitions; partially offset by an increase of $47.9 million in cash outflows related to capital expenditures and development activities, as reflected in the table below, a decrease of $40.9 million in cash inflows from dispositions, a decrease of $37.2 million in cash inflows related to timing of 1031 proceeds received from dispositions and a decrease of $11.4 million in cash inflows from distributions of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures.\nWe pursue the acquisition of buildings and land and consider selective development of new buildings in markets where we perceive that demand and market rental rates will provide attractive financial returns. The amount of cash used related to acquisitions and development and redevelopment investments will vary from period to period based on a number of factors, including, among others, current and anticipated future market conditions impacting the desirability of investments, leasing results with respect to our existing development and redevelopment projects and our ability to locate attractive opportunities. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Summary of Significant Transactions and Activities During 2015 -Development Activities\u201d for further details regarding projected investment of our current development activities as well as cumulative costs incurred as of December 31, 2015. Our total capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were comprised of the following (in thousands):\n\nWe capitalize costs directly related to the development, predevelopment, redevelopment or improvement of our investments in real estate. Building and land improvements comprise capital expenditures related to maintaining our consolidated operating activities. Due diligence capital improvements relate to acquired operating properties and are generally incurred within 12 months of the acquisition date.\nWe capitalize indirect costs such as personnel, office and administrative expenses that are directly related to our development projects, redevelopment projects and successful origination of new leases based on an estimate of the time spent on the development and leasing activities. These capitalized costs for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $11.6 million, $9.3 million and $7.8 million, respectively. In addition, we capitalize interest costs incurred associated with development and construction activities. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 total interest capitalized was $15.8 million, $9.1 million and $8.3 million, respectively.\nNet cash provided by financing activities decreased $60.2 million to $16.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $77.0 million during the same period in 2014 primarily due to the following activities:\n \u25cf $238.6 million decrease in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock; \n \u25cf $13.7 million decrease due to 7.7 million additional shares issued in 2014 under our continuous equity offering program and a public offering in November, operating partnership unit redemptions, distributions to noncontrolling interest holders and an increase in the dividend rate per share declared in October 2015 resulting in an increase in our dividends and distributions paid to common stockholders and unitholders; and \n \u25cf $4.5 million decrease primarily due to cash outflow for loan costs related to our amended and restated bank unsecured credit facilities and $200.0 million term loan during 2015; which was partially offset by \n \u25cf $160.0 million increase in proceeds from senior unsecured notes where proceeds during 2015 of $200.0 million exceeded repayments of $40.0 million; \n \u25cf $35.0 million increase in proceeds from our senior unsecured revolving credit facility as net borrowings of $33.0 million during 2015 exceeded our $2.0 million of net repayments during 2014; and \n \u25cf $1.1 million decrease in mortgage notes as principal payments of $59.6 million in 2014 exceeded principal payments of $58.6 million in 2015. \nYear ended December 31, 2014 compared to year ended December 31, 2013\nCash and cash equivalents\u201d were $19.6 million and $32.2 million as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $17.1 million to $170.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $152.9 million during the same period in 2013. This change was primarily due to an increase in property net operating income attributable to acquired properties and operating performance at existing properties.\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased $41.5 million to $259.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $301.1 million during the same period in 2013. This change was primarily due to an increase of $20.2 million of cash inflows from dispositions, an increase in distributions of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures of $19.3 million and a decrease of $39.7 million in cash outflows from acquisitions. These activities were partially offset by an increase of cash outflows related to capital expenditures of $49.7 million, as reflected in the table below, and a decrease of $7.7 million related to cash inflows from casualty and involuntary conversion proceeds.\nOur total capital expenditures for the years ended, 2014 and 2013 were comprised of the following (in thousands):\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities decreased $90.7 million to $77.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $167.7 million during the same period in 2013 primarily due to the following activities:\n \u25cf $69.0 million increase in proceeds from our senior unsecured revolving credit facility as net payments of $71.0 million during 2013 exceeded our $2.0 million of net repayments during 2014; which was partially offset by \n \u25cf $20.9 million decrease in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock; \n \u25cf $97.4 million decrease in proceeds from senior unsecured notes where proceeds in 2013 of $497.4 million exceeded repayments of $400.0 million with no corresponding activity in 2014; \n \u25cf $35.4 million decrease in mortgage notes as principal payments of $59.6 million in 2014 exceeded net principal payments of $24.2 million in 2013; and \n \u25cf $8.8 million decrease due to additional shares issued for offerings and operating partnership unit redemptions resulting in an increase in our dividends and distributions paid to common stockholders and unitholders. \nCommon Stock\nAs of December 31, 2015 approximately 88.3 million shares of common stock were issued and outstanding.\nOP Units\nLimited partners have the right to require the Company to redeem all or a portion of the OP Units held by the limited partner at a redemption price equal to and in the form of the Cash Amount (as defined in the Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement of the Operating Partnership ( Partnership Agreement\u201d)), provided that such OP Units have been outstanding for at least one year. DCT may, in its sole discretion, purchase the OP Units by paying to the limited partner either the Cash Amount or the REIT Shares Amount (generally one share of DCT's common stock for each OP Unit), as defined in the Partnership Agreement.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015 approximately 0.3 million OP Units were redeemed for approximately $4.4 million in cash and approximately 0.2 million shares of DCT common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2015, approximately 4.0 million OP Units were issued and outstanding including approximately 0.6 million vested LTIP Units issued under our Long-Term Incentive Plan.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the aggregate redemption value of the then-outstanding OP Units held by entities other than DCT was approximately $150.9 million based on the $37.37 per share closing price of DCT's common stock on December 31, 2015.\nDividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan\nWe offer shares of our common stock through our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (the Plan\u201d). The Plan permits stockholders to acquire additional shares with quarterly dividends and to make additional cash investments to buy shares directly through our third party transfer agent. Shares of common stock may be purchased in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions.\nDistributions\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our board of directors declared distributions to stockholders and unitholders totaling approximately $105.0 million and $99.7 million, respectively. Existing cash balances, cash provided from operations and borrowings under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and dispositions were used to pay distributions during 2015 and 2014.\nThe payment of quarterly distributions is determined by our board of directors and may be adjusted at its discretion at any time. During February 2016, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.29 per share, payable on April 13, 2016 to stockholders of record as of April 2016.\nOutstanding Indebtedness\nAs of December 31, 2015, our outstanding indebtedness of approximately $1.6 billion consisted of mortgage notes, senior unsecured notes and bank unsecured credit facilities, excluding approximately $35.7 million representing our proportionate share of non-recourse debt associated with unconsolidated joint ventures. As of December 31, 2014, our outstanding indebtedness of approximately $1.4 billion consisted of mortgage notes, senior unsecured notes and bank unsecured credit facilities, excluding approximately $42.5 million representing our proportionate share of debt associated with unconsolidated joint ventures.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the gross book value of our consolidated properties was approximately $4.1 billion and the gross book value of all properties securing our mortgage debt was approximately $0.6 billion. As of December 31, 2014, the total gross book value of our consolidated properties was approximately $4.0 billion and the gross book value of all properties securing our mortgage debt was approximately $0.6 billion. Our debt has various covenants with which we were in compliance as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nOur debt instruments require monthly, quarterly or semiannual payments of interest and mortgages generally require monthly or quarterly repayments of principal. Currently, cash flows from our operations are sufficient to satisfy these debt service requirements and we anticipate that cash flows from operations will continue to be sufficient to satisfy our debt service excluding principal maturities, which we plan to fund from refinancing and/or new debt.\nAll of our senior unsecured notes contain certain cross-default provisions which may be triggered in the event that any material indebtedness is in default. These cross-default provisions may require us to repay such senior unsecured debt. We are not in default and do not have any unsecured debt maturities through April 2016.\nWe have certain non-recourse, secured loans which are cross-collateralized by multiple properties. In the event of a default, we may then be required to repay such indebtedness, together with applicable prepayment charges, to avoid foreclosure on all cross collateralized properties within the applicable pool. We generally have broad substitution rights that afford DCT the opportunity to replace encumbered properties with replacement properties. We are not in default and do not have any cross-collateralized debt maturing through April 2017.\nIn the event of default or foreclosure, or if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or meet our payment obligations, the amount of our distributable cash flows and our financial condition would be adversely affected.\nFinancing Strategy\nWe do not have a formal policy limiting the amount of debt we incur, although we currently intend to operate so that our financial metrics are generally consistent with investment grade peers in the real estate industry. We continually evaluate our secured and unsecured leverage and among other relevant metrics, our fixed charge coverage. Our charter and our bylaws do not limit the indebtedness that we may incur. We are, however, subject to certain covenants which may limit our outstanding indebtedness.\nDebt Issuances\nDuring 2015, we assumed two mortgage notes with aggregate outstanding balances of approximately $21.1 million in connection with property acquisitions. We recorded approximately a $1.9 million premium in connection with the assumption of these notes.\nOn April 8, 2015, we amended and restated our existing $225.0 million senior unsecured term loan and $300.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility with our syndicated bank group. The senior unsecured term loan was disaggregated into two tranches, $125.0 million and $100.0 million, with maturity dates of April 8, 2020 and April 8, 2017, respectively. The senior unsecured revolving credit facility's commitment was increased to $400.0 million with a maturity date of April 8, 2019.\nOn December 10, 2015, we entered into a $200.0 million variable rate senior unsecured term loan which matures on December 10, 2022. On December 11, 2015, we entered into a pay-fixed, receive-floating interest rate swap which effectively fixes the interest rate on the term loan at 3.31% through maturity, however, there is no floor on the variable interest rate of the swap whereas the current variable-rate debt is subject to a 0.0% floor. In the event that US LIBOR is negative, the Company would make payments to the hedge counterparty equal to the spread between US LIBOR and zero. We primarily used the proceeds to pay down the senior unsecured revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes.\nDebt Retirement\nDuring October 2015, we paid-off a $50.9 million note at par maturing in February 2016 using proceeds from the Company's senior unsecured revolving credit facility.\nLine of Credit\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $70.0 million outstanding and $326.5 million available under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility, net of one letter of credit totaling $3.5 million. As of December 31, 2014, we had $37.0 million outstanding and $243.5 million available under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility, net of three letters of credit totaling $19.5 million.\nThe senior unsecured revolving credit facility agreement contains various covenants with which we were in compliance as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nDebt Maturities\nThe following table presents the scheduled maturities of our debt and regularly scheduled principal amortization, excluding unamortized premiums, discounts and deferred loan costs, as of December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\n\n (1) The term loan facilities are presented in Senior unsecured notes\u201d in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. \nContractual Obligations\nThe following table reflects our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015, specifically our obligations under long-term debt agreements, operating lease agreements and ground lease agreements (in thousands):\n\n (1) From time-to-time in the normal course of our business, we enter into various contracts with third parties that may obligate us to make payments, such as maintenance agreements at our properties. Such contracts, in the aggregate, do not represent material obligations, are typically short-term and cancellable within 90 days and are not included in the table above. Also, excluded from the total are our estimated construction costs to complete development and redevelopment projects of approximately $173.3 million. \n (2) Variable interest rate payments are estimated based on the LIBOR rate at December 31, 2015. \n (3) Three of our buildings comprising 0.7 million square feet reside on 38 acres of land which is leased from an airport authority. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements, other than those disclosed under contractual obligations, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors, other than items discussed herein.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our proportionate share of the total construction loans of our unconsolidated development joint ventures was $35.7 million, which is scheduled to mature during 2017. Our proportionate share of the total construction loans, including undrawn amounts, of our unconsolidated development joint ventures includes 50.0% of the construction loans associated with the SCLA joint venture which are non-recourse to the venture partners.\nIndebtedness and Other Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThere are no lines of credit or side agreements related to, or between, our unconsolidated joint ventures and us, and there are no other derivative financial instruments between our unconsolidated joint ventures and us. In addition, we do not believe we have any material exposure to financial guarantees, except as discussed above.\nWe may elect to fund additional capital to a joint venture through equity contributions (generally on a basis proportionate to our ownership interests), advances or partner loans, although such funding is not required contractually or otherwise. As of December 31, 2015, our proportionate share of non-recourse debt associated with unconsolidated joint ventures is $35.7 million. The maturities of our proportionate share of the non-recourse debt are summarized in the table below (in thousands):\n\nTable 274: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_tables": "Table 134: <table> <tr> <td>

provides an in-depth examination of DCT Industrial Trust Inc.'s financial situation and operational results. The document emphasizes that the report should be considered alongside consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes from other sections of the report.\n\nDCT Industrial Trust Inc. is a leading industrial real estate company focusing on acquiring, developing, leasing, and managing bulk distribution and light industrial properties primarily in high-volume distribution markets in the United States. The Company operates as a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) and conducts business through DCT Industrial Operating Partnership LP, which DCT controls as the sole general partner.\n\nThe Company's primary goal is to maximize Funds From Operations (FFO), the net asset value of its portfolio, and overall shareholder returns. Towards achieving these objectives, DCT intends to enhance cash flows from existing properties, invest in high-quality acquisitions and development opportunities, and recycle capital by selling non-core assets to reinvest in higher growth opportunities.\n\nLooking forward, DCT expects to see continued improvement in industrial real estate fundamentals, driven by economic growth and the expansion of e-commerce and U.S. manufacturing. In light of positive net absorption and declining market vacancy rates, DCT anticipates an increase in rental rates and fewer rental concessions in 2016. Despite an uptick in new development, construction levels are expected to remain below historical peaks.\n\nDCT's same-store net operating income is expected to rise in 2016 compared to 2015, mainly due to higher occupancy and increasing rental rates. Strategic new building development and opportunistic acquisitions will be pursued to enhance long-term growth. The Company also intends to selectively divest non-strategic assets to fund investments and improve the overall quality of its portfolio.\n\nRegarding liquidity, DCT believes it has adequate resources to cover operating costs, property maintenance, and distributions. However, investments may be financed through new common shares issuance, asset sale proceeds, or additional borrowing.\n\nFor 2015, notable activities included the acquisition of 17 buildings, totaling 2.4 million square feet, and the acquisition of 271.9 acres of land held for future development. The Company also completed various development projects and sold 30 properties totaling 5.3 million square feet.\n\nThe impact of inflation has been minimal due to low historical inflation rates, and most leases require tenants to cover their share of operating expenses, reducing DCT's exposure to inflation. Also, many leases have short durations, allowing for rate adjustments in line with the market upon renewal.\n\nCritical accounting policies and estimates involved in financial statement preparation include capitalization of costs, valuation when acquiring investment properties, accounting for potential asset impairments, judgments on derivatives and hedging, and revenue recognition, particularly in lease classifications and tenant improvement allowances.\n\nYear-on-year performance for 2015 showed a significant increase in net income attributable to common stockholders, driven by industrial real estate market improvements, profitable transactions, and effective operational management. \n\nThis detailed overview of DCT Industrial Trust Inc.'s financial condition and operational strategy outlines a consistent and strategic approach to maximize returns for shareholders through effective asset management and prudent financial planning."}
