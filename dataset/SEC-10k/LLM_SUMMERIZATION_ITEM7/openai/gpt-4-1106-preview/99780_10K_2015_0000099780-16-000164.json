Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and certain other factors that may affect our future results. Our MD&A is presented in the following sections:\n\u2022Company Overview\n\u2022Executive Summary\n\u2022Results of Operations\n\u2022Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\u2022Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\n\u2022Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\u2022Recent Accounting Pronouncements\n\u2022Forward-Looking Statements\nOur MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCompany Overview\nTrinity Industries, Inc., headquartered in Dallas, Texas, is a diversified industrial company that owns market-leading businesses providing products and services to the energy, transportation, chemical, and construction sectors. We operate in five distinct business groups which we report on a segment basis: the Rail Group, Construction Products Group, Inland Barge Group, Energy Equipment Group, and Railcar Leasing and Management Services Group. We also report the All Other segment which includes the Company's captive insurance and transportation companies; legal, environmental, and maintenance costs associated with non-operating facilities; and other peripheral businesses.\nOur Rail and Inland Barge Groups and our structural wind towers, utility structures, and storage and distribution containers businesses operate in cyclical industries. Additionally, results in our Construction Products Group are affected by seasonal fluctuations with the first quarter historically being the weakest quarter. Railcar sales from the lease fleet are the primary driver of fluctuations in results in the Railcar Leasing and Management Services Group.\nDuring the most recent year, an increased level of uncertainty in the macro-economic environment reduced the pace of new order volumes in certain of the Company's businesses. Over the last several years, many of our businesses benefitted from investment activity occurring in the upstream energy markets and a relatively high and stable price of oil. The extended downturn in the price of oil as well as other factors including, among others, the strong dollar and weakness across other commodity prices, has created uncertainty for our customers in their long-term capital planning processes. At the same time, demand fundamentals in the automotive, construction, petrochemical, and wind energy sectors are positive. As a result, the Company is experiencing a mixed demand environment. We continually assess our manufacturing capacity and are taking steps to align our production capacity with demand for our products.\nExecutive Summary\nThe Company's revenues for 2015 were $6.39 billion, representing an increase of 3.6% over last year. The increase in revenues for 2015, when compared to the previous year, resulted primarily from higher shipment volumes and higher pricing on railcars delivered by our Rail Group. Revenues in our Energy Equipment Group increased primarily due to an acquisition. Revenues increased slightly for our Inland Barge Group as a result of higher shipment volumes and product mix changes. In our Leasing Group, leasing and management revenues increased by 10.7% while revenues from railcar sales owned one year or less totaled $404.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared with $486.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Revenues in our Construction Products Group declined by 3.5% as higher acquisition-related revenues in our Aggregates business were more than offset by lower shipment volumes in our Highway Products business.\nOperating profit for 2015 increased by 15.0% to $1.44 billion compared to $1.25 billion last year. Operating margin improved to 22.5% in 2015 from 20.3% in 2014. Overall operating profit and margin grew for the year ended December 31, 2015, when compared with the prior year, primarily due to increased volumes in our Rail and Energy Equipment Groups as well as higher leasing and management revenues and higher railcar sales in our Leasing Group during the period. Selling, engineering, and administrative expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to higher legal and litigation-related expenses as well as increased compensation costs resulting from acquisitions and higher average headcount during the year. At December 31, 2015, the Company's overall headcount, including both production and non-production personnel, decreased slightly from the end of 2014.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014 our backlog of firm and noncancellable orders was as follows:\nTable 38: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rail Group\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>External Customers\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,948.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,204.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leasing Group\n</td> <td>1,452.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,010.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,401.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,214.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inland Barge Group\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>416.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>437.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wind towers\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>371.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>473.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, our rail manufacturing businesses received orders for 22,145 railcars. The change in backlog as of December 31, 2015 compared with our backlog as of December 31, 2014 reflects the value of orders taken and orders delivered during the year. The orders in our backlog from the Leasing Group are fully supported by lease commitments with external customers. The final amount dedicated to the Leasing Group may vary by the time of delivery as customers may alternatively choose to purchase railcars as external sales from the Rail Group. Approximately 51% of our railcar backlog is expected to be delivered during the twelve months ending December 31, 2016 with the remainder to be delivered from 2017 through 2020. Substantially all of our Inland Barge and structural wind towers backlog is expected to be delivered during the twelve months ending December 31, 2016. The Company does not report backlog from its utility structures business because certain contracts contain partial order cancellation provisions.\nCapital expenditures for 2015 were $1,029.8 million with $833.8 million utilized for net lease fleet additions, net of deferred profit of $259.6 million. Manufacturing and corporate capital expenditures for 2016 are projected to be between $150.0 million and $200.0 million. For 2016, we expect the annual net cash investment in new railcars in our lease fleet to be approximately $385.0 million after considering the expected proceeds received from leased railcar sales during the year.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company received proceeds from the sale of leased railcars to Element Financial Corporation (\"Element\") under the strategic alliance with Element announced in December 2013 as follows:\nTable 39: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leasing Group:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Railcars owned one year or less at the time of sale\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>228.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>446.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Railcars owned more than one year at the time of sale\n</td> <td>294.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>235.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rail Group\n</td> <td>227.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>200.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>750.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>882.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSince the inception of our alliance in December 2013, the Company has received proceeds of $1,738.5 million from the sale of leased railcars to Element. In October 2015, the Company and Element announced a $1 billion extension of the alliance through December 2019.\nIn February 2015, our Leasing Group purchased all of the railcars that previously had been leased to the Leasing Group from one of the independent owner trusts for $121.1 million, resulting in the termination of the selling trust and the Leasing Group's remaining future operating lease obligations to the selling trust totaling $105.8 million. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of lease arrangements with the independent owner trusts.\nIn March 2015, we completed the acquisition of the assets of a lightweight aggregates business in our Construction Products Group with facilities located in Louisiana, Alabama, and Arkansas for a purchase price of $46.2 million.\nIn April 2015, the TILC warehouse loan facility was increased to $1 billion and extended through April 2018. Borrowings under the facility totaled $264.3 million as of December 31, 2015. Under the renewed facility, $735.7 million was unused and available as of December 31, 2015 based on the amount of warehouse-eligible, unpledged equipment.\nIn May 2015, we renewed and extended our unsecured corporate revolving credit facility through May 2020, increasing the size of the facility from $425.0 million to $600.0 million. Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a defined index rate plus a margin and are guaranteed by certain 100%-owned subsidiaries of the Company. As of December 31, 2015, we had letters of credit issued under our revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $91.6 million, leaving $508.4 million available for borrowing.\nIn May 2015, Trinity Rail Leasing VI LLC (\"TRL VI\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company owned through TILC, repaid its Promissory Notes in full for approximately $340.0 million. The Promissory Notes were issued by TRL VI in 2008 and secured by a diversified portfolio of leased railcars and certain cash reserves. The Promissory Notes had an effective interest rate of 5.63%,\nafter consideration of interest rate hedges. Per the original terms of the Promissory Notes, the borrowing margin was scheduled to increase by 0.50% in May 2015.\nIn May 2015, the Company declared an increase in its quarterly dividend from $0.10 to $0.11 per share, reflecting a 10% increase. Additionally, at the Company's Annual Meeting of Stockholders in May 2015, the Company's stockholders approved amendments to the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, increasing the number of authorized shares of common stock from 200 million to 400 million and reducing the par value of the Company's common stock to $0.01 per share from $1.00 per share.\nIn June 2015, we sold the assets of our galvanizing business for $51.3 million which included six facilities in Texas, Mississippi, and Louisiana. The assets and results of operations for this divestiture were previously included in the Construction Products Group.\nIn December 2015, the Company's Board of Directors renewed its $250 million share repurchase program effective January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2017. The new program replaced the previous program which expired on December 31, 2015. Under the previous program, 3,947,320 shares were repurchased during the year ended December 31, 2015, at a cost of $115.0 million.\nA current summary of the Company's Highway Products litigation is provided in Note 18 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nResults of Operations\nYears Ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013\nOverall Summary for Continuing Operations\nRevenues\nTable 40: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent Change 2015 versus 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>External\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Intersegment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rail Group\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,236.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,225.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,461.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction Products Group\n</td> <td>520.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>532.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inland Barge Group\n</td> <td>652.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>652.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Energy Equipment Group\n</td> <td>883.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>230.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,113.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Railcar Leasing and Management Services Group\n</td> <td>1,091.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,104.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All Other\n</td> <td>7.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment Totals before Eliminations\n</td> <td>6,392.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,585.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,978.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Eliminations -

We also experienced overall higher volumes in our Inland Barge Group; and in our Energy Equipment Group, primarily as a result of an acquisition in 2014. Revenues from the Construction Products Group declined as a result of lower revenues from our Highway Products business partially offset by higher acquisition-related volumes in our Aggregates business. Our Leasing Group experienced lower revenues from external sales of railcars owned one year or less, partially offset by higher leasing and management revenues due to increased rental rates and net lease fleet additions.\nOur revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014, increased by 41.3% from the previous year. The increase resulted primarily from higher shipment volumes and pricing due to increased overall demand and a more favorable product mix in our Rail Group combined with the effects of higher volumes in our Construction Products, Inland Barge, and Energy Equipment Groups. In addition to higher volumes, revenues from our Inland Barge Group increased as a result of favorable product mix changes while an increase in revenues from our Energy Equipment Group was primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2014. Our Leasing Group experienced higher leasing and management revenues due to increased rental rates and higher utilization as well as higher external railcar sales owned one year or less.\nOperating Costs\nOperating costs are comprised of cost of revenues; selling, engineering, and administrative costs; and gains or losses on property disposals.\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rail Group\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,530.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,092.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,377.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction Products Group\n</td> <td>478.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>486.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>472.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inland Barge Group\n</td> <td>535.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>524.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>480.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Energy Equipment Group\n</td> <td>962.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>884.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>604.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Railcar Leasing and Management Services Group\n</td> <td>498.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>602.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>348.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All Other\n</td> <td>120.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>136.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment Totals before Eliminations and Corporate Expenses\n</td> <td>6,126.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,725.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,383.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate\n</td> <td>152.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Eliminations - Lease subsidiary\n</td> <td>(904.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(577.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(621.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Eliminations - Other\n</td> <td>(420.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(348.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(243.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,953.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,919.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,592.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by 1.0% over the previous year primarily due to higher shipment levels in our Rail Group as well as acquisition-related increases in our Energy Equipment Group. Operating costs in our Leasing Group declined as a result of lower railcar sales owned one year or less during the year ended December 31, 2015 over the prior year in addition to higher gains from railcar sales owned more than one year in 2015 over the prior year. Selling, engineering, and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher legal and litigation-related expenses as well as increased compensation costs resulting from acquisitions and higher average headcount during the year. For 2014, the 36.9% increase in operating costs over the previous year was primarily due to higher shipment levels in our manufacturing segments and higher railcar sales in our Leasing Group. Selling, engineering, and administrative expenses increased overall primarily due to higher performance-related compensation costs and higher average headcount in addition to increased legal and litigation-related expenses.

Rail Group operating profit also increased as a result of improved pricing and higher operating efficiencies partially offset by product mix changes. Operating profit in our Leasing Group increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 over the prior year period from higher leasing and management revenues as well as higher operating profit from railcar sales. Operating profit from railcar sales in our Leasing Group totaled $275.1 million and $228.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Operating profit in our Inland Barge Group was substantially unchanged while operating profit in the Construction Products Group decreased for the year ended December 31, 2015 when compared to the prior year, as higher volumes in our Aggregates business related to an acquisition in 2015 were more than offset by lower volumes in our Highway Products business.\nOur operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by 61.9% primarily as a result of higher shipments in our manufacturing segments as well as higher railcar sales in our Leasing Group.\nFor a further discussion of revenues, costs, and the operating results of individual segments, see Segment Discussion below.\nOther Income and Expense.

See Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further explanation of activities with respect to our partially-owned leasing subsidiaries. See Note 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of income taxes.\nIncome from continuing operations before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 was $1,241.1 million, $1,051.4 million, and $571.2 million, respectively, for U.S. operations, and $10.9 million, $12.6 million, and $19.3 million, respectively, for foreign operations, principally Mexico. The Company provides deferred income taxes on the unrepatriated earnings of its foreign operations where it results in a deferred tax liability.\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company had $30.7 million of federal consolidated net operating loss carryforwards and $5.3 million of tax-effected state loss carryforwards remaining. The federal net operating loss carryforwards were acquired as part of an acquisition of a company in 2010 and are subject to limitations on the amount that can be utilized in any one tax year. The federal net operating loss carryforwards are due to expire in 2028 and 2029. We have established a valuation allowance for federal, state, and foreign tax operating losses and credits that we have estimated may not be realizable.\nThe IRS field work for our 2006-2008 audit cycle and our 2009-2011 audit cycle have concluded and all issues have been agreed upon by us and the IRS. The issues that were a part of the mutual agreement process, previously disclosed have been agreed. As the cycles included years in which tax refunds were issued to us, the Joint Committee on Taxation is required to review the final\nrevenue agent report before the issues are effectively settled. For this reason, we cannot determine when the 2006-2008 or the 2009-2011 cycle will close and all issues formally settled.\nIncome tax payments, net of refunds, differ from the current provision primarily based on when estimated tax payments were due as compared to when the related income was earned and taxable. The Company's consolidated income tax position was a net receivable of $85.0 million and $48.3 million from federal, state, and foreign jurisdictions at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 totaled $326.8 million, $399.0 million, and $110.9 million, respectively.\nSegment Discussion\nRail

Approximately 75% of the increase in railcar revenue results from an increase in unit deliveries with the remainder due to improved pricing partially offset by product mix changes. Cost of revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 by 13.9% when compared with the prior year primarily due to an increase in unit deliveries partially offset by greater operating efficiencies.\nRevenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 by 33.1% when compared to 2013 with approximately 75% of the increase resulting from higher unit deliveries and the remainder of the increase due to improved pricing and product mix changes. Cost of revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 by 29.9% when compared with the prior year primarily due to an increase in unit deliveries.\nUnit decreases and lower prices decreased total backlog dollars by 25.1% when comparing December 31, 2015 to the prior year. The average selling price in the backlog at December 31, 2015 was 6.5% lower as compared to the previous year primarily due to product mix changes. Backlog increased when comparing 2014 versus 2013 due to unit increases and higher prices. The average selling price in the backlog at December 31, 2014 was 6.0% lower as compared to the previous year due to product mix changes. The backlog dedicated to the Leasing Group is supported by lease commitments with external customers. The final amount dedicated to the Leasing Group may vary by the time of delivery as customers may alternatively choose to purchase railcars as external sales from the Rail Group.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, railcar shipments included sales to the Leasing Group of $1,164.4 million with a deferred profit of $259.6 million, representing 8,760 railcars, compared to $710.1 million with a deferred profit of $133.1 million, representing 6,810 railcars, in the comparable period in 2014. Results for the year ended December 31, 2013, included sales to the Leasing Group of $756.5 million with a deferred profit of $135.4 million, representing 6,620 railcars. Sales to the Leasing Group and related profits are included in the operating results of the Rail Group but are eliminated in consolidation. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, railcar shipments included sales of leased railcars to third parties of $260.5 million and $243.2 million, respectively. There were no sales of leased railcars to third parties from the Rail Group during the year ended December 31, 2013.\nThe Leasing Group purchases a portion of our railcar production utilizing the Company's cash or alternatively, financing a portion of the purchase price through a non-recourse warehouse loan facility. Periodically, the Leasing Group refinances those borrowings through equipment financing transactions. In 2015, the Leasing Group purchased 25.5% of our railcar production compared to 22.5% in 2014.\nConstruction Products Group\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 versus 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014 versus 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Highway products\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>277.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>317.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>335.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aggregates\n</td> <td>192.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>152.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>62.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>532.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>551.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>525.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating costs:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenues\n</td> <td>407.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>430.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>409.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, engineering, and administrative costs\n</td> <td>81.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property disposition gains\n</td> <td>(10.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>65.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit margin\n</td> <td>10.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues decreased for the year ended December 31, 2015 by 3.5% compared to the same period in 2014.

Forty-five percent of the increase in leasing and management revenues was due to higher average rental rates on renewals and 25% was due to net fleet additions with the remainder resulting from higher utilization and other fees.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Leasing Group received proceeds from the sale of leased railcars to Element Financial Corporation (\"Element\") under the strategic alliance with Element announced in December 2013 as follows:\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Railcars owned one year or less at the time of sale\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>228.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>446.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Railcars owned more than one year at the time of sale\n</td> <td>294.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>235.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>523.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>682.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn October 2015, the Company and Element announced a $1 billion extension of the alliance through December 2019.\nOperating profit increased by 17.4% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 due to higher profit from railcar sales and higher leasing and management operating profit. Leasing and management profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased due to higher average rental rates, net fleet additions, and decreased rent expense partially offset by higher depreciation and maintenance expense. In February 2015, the Leasing Group purchased all of the railcars which previously had been leased to the Company from one of the independent owner trusts. As a result of this purchase, rent expense decreased for the year ended December 31, 2015 when compared to 2014. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of lease arrangements with the independent owner trusts.\nOperating profit increased by 74.0% for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013 due to higher profit from railcar sales. Leasing and management profits increased primarily due to higher average rental rates in our lease fleet, partially offset by increased maintenance costs resulting from higher regulatory compliance activity for the year ended December 31, 2014 when compared to 2013. Selling, engineering, and administrative costs increased to $49.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $37.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily due to increased staffing and higher performance-related compensation costs.\nThe Leasing Group generally uses its non-recourse warehouse loan facility or cash to provide initial financing for a portion of the purchase price of the railcars. In April 2015, the TILC warehouse loan facility was increased to $1 billion and extended through April 2018. After initial financing, the Leasing Group generally obtains long-term financing for the railcars in the lease fleet through non-recourse asset-backed securities; long-term non-recourse operating leases pursuant to sales/leaseback transactions; long-term recourse debt such as equipment trust certificates; or third-party equity.

The increase in operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2014 was due to higher costs of facility maintenance activities, higher costs related to commodity hedges, and higher reserves.\nCorporate\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 versus 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014 versus 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating costs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>152.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>119.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily due to higher legal and litigation-related expenses as well as performance-related compensation costs and increased staffing compared to 2014.\nThe increase in operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013 is primarily due to higher performance-related compensation costs and increased staffing, increased legal expenses and approximately $8.7 million in one-time costs related to the acquisition of Meyer Utility Structures (\"Meyer\") for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for each of the last three years:\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cash provided by (required by):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>939.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>819.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>662.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>(511.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(814.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(818.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>(530.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>454.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(101.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>459.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(144.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2015 compared with 2014\nOperating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $939.7 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $819.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Cash flow provided by operating activities increased primarily due to higher operating profits in 2015.\nReceivables at December 31, 2015 were substantially unchanged from December 31, 2014 as a higher income tax receivable was offset by lower trade receivables in our Rail, Energy Equipment, and Construction Products Groups. Raw materials inventory at December 31, 2015 decreased by $106.8 million or 18.2% since December 31, 2014 primarily attributable to lower levels in our Rail Group from improved inventory management. Finished goods inventory at December 31, 2015 increased by $56.9 million or 30.8% since December 31, 2014 primarily due to higher inventory related to scheduled shipments in early 2016 in our Rail and Energy Equipment Groups. Accounts payable decreased by $78.6 million as a result of lower inventory levels, while accrued liabilities decreased by $169.6 million from December 31, 2014 due primarily to lower customer advances outstanding. We continually review reserves related to bad debt as well as the adequacy of lower of cost or market valuations related to accounts receivable and inventory.\nInvesting Activities. Net cash required by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $511.3 million compared to $814.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $1,029.8 million, of which $833.8 million were for additions to the lease fleet. This compares to $464.6 million of capital expenditures for the same period last year, of which $245.3 million were for additions to the lease fleet. Proceeds from the sale of property, plant, and equipment and other assets totaled $522.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, including railcar sales from the lease fleet owned more than one year at the time of sale totaling $514.6 million. This compares to $288.8 million for the same period in 2014, including railcar sales from the lease fleet owned more than one year at the time of sale totaling $265.8 million. Full-year manufacturing and corporate capital expenditures for 2016 are projected to range between $150.0 million and $200.0 million. For 2016, we expect the annual net cash investment in new railcars in our lease fleet to be approximately $385.0 million after considering the expected proceeds received from leased railcar sales during the year. Net cash required related to acquisitions amounted to $46.2 million and $714.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Proceeds from business divestitures totaled $51.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Short-term marketable securities for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased $9.9 million.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash required by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 was $530.3 million compared to $454.9 million of net cash provided by financing activities for the same period in 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we retired $587.2 million in debt including $340.0 million for the full repayment of promissory notes related\nto one of our wholly-owned leasing subsidiaries.We borrowed $242.4 million, net of debt issuance costs, during the year ended December 31, 2015, from our TILC warehouse loan facility.

Also, during the year ended December 31, 2014, we received $49.6 million in equity contributions from noncontrolling interests in one of the Company's partially-owned leasing subsidiaries. Additionally, we repurchased shares of the Company's stock under a share repurchase program as described further below.

Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $819.2 million compared to $662.2 million of net cash provided by operating activities for the same period in 2013. Cash flow provided by operating activities increased primarily due to higher operating profits in 2014.\nReceivables at December 31, 2014 increased by $56.4 million or 15.1% from December 31, 2013, primarily due to an increase in income taxes receivable. Raw materials inventory at December 31, 2014 increased by $108.4 million or 22.7% since December 31, 2013 primarily attributable to higher levels in our Rail Group required to meet production demands. Finished goods inventory at December 31, 2014 increased by $48.5 million or 35.6% since December 31, 2013 primarily due to higher levels in our Rail and Energy Equipment Groups pending delivery. Accounts payable increased by $60.7 million to support higher inventory levels, while accrued liabilities increased by $82.1 million from December 31, 2013 due to higher customer advances which totaled $193.8 million at December 31, 2014.\nInvesting Activities.

In October 2015, the Company and Element announced a $1 billion extension of the alliance through December 2019.\nIn March 2015, we completed the acquisition of the assets of a lightweight aggregates business in our Construction Products Group with facilities located in Louisiana, Alabama, and Arkansas for a purchase price of $46.2 million.\nIn April 2015, the TILC warehouse loan facility was increased to $1 billion and extended through April 2018. The loan facility, established to finance railcars owned by TILC, had $264.3 million in outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2015. Under the renewed facility, $735.7 million was unused and available as of December 31, 2015 based on the amount of warehouse-eligible, unpledged equipment. The warehouse loan facility is a non-recourse obligation secured by a portfolio of railcars and operating leases, certain cash reserves, and other assets acquired and owned by the warehouse loan facility trust. The principal and interest of this indebtedness are paid from the cash flows of the underlying leases. Advances under the facility bear interest at a defined index rate plus a margin, for an all-in interest rate of 2.10% at December 31, 2015. Interest rate pricing remained unchanged under the renewed facility. Amounts outstanding at maturity, absent renewal, are payable under the renewed facility in April 2019.\nIn May 2015, TRL VI, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company owned through TILC, repaid the Promissory Notes in full for approximately $340.0 million. The Promissory Notes were issued by TRL VI in 2008 and secured by a diversified portfolio of leased railcars and certain cash reserves. The Promissory Notes had an effective interest rate of 5.63%, after consideration of interest rate hedges. Per the original terms of the Promissory Notes, the borrowing margin was scheduled to increase by 0.50% in May 2015.\nIn May 2015, we renewed and extended our unsecured corporate revolving credit facility through May 2020, increasing the size of the facility from $425.0 million to $600.0 million. As of December 31, 2015, we had letters of credit issued under our revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $91.6 million, leaving $508.4 million available for borrowing. Other than these letters of credit, there were no borrowings under our revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2015, or for the two year period then ended. Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a defined index rate plus a margin and are guaranteed by certain 100%-owned subsidiaries of the Company.\nIn December 2015, the Company's Board of Directors renewed its $250 million share repurchase program effective January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2017. The new program replaced the previous program which expired on December 31, 2015. Under the previous program, 3,947,320 shares were repurchased during the year ended December 31, 2015, at a cost of $115.0 million.\nIn May 2015, the Company declared an increase in its quarterly dividend from $0.10 to $0.11 per share, reflecting a 10% increase.\nIn June 2015, we sold the assets of our U.S. galvanizing business for $51.3 million which included six facilities in Texas, Mississippi, and Louisiana. The assets and results of operations for this divestiture were previously included in the Construction Products Group.\nDuring the most recent quarter, an increased level of uncertainty in the macro-economic environment reduced the pace of new order volumes in certain of the Company's businesses. Over the last several years, many of our businesses benefitted from investment activity occurring in the upstream energy markets and a relatively high and stable price of oil. The extended downturn in the price of oil as well as other factors including, among others, the strong dollar and weakness across other commodity prices, has created uncertainty for our customers in their long-term capital planning processes. At the same time, demand fundamentals in the automotive, construction, petrochemical, and wind energy sectors are positive. As a result, the Company is experiencing a mixed demand environment. We continually assess our manufacturing capacity and are taking steps to align our production capacity with demand for our products.\nEquity Investment\nSee Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about the Company's investment in partially-owned leasing subsidiaries.\nFuture Operating Requirements\nWe expect to finance future operating requirements with cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities; cash flows from operations; and, depending on market conditions, short-term debt, long-term debt, and equity. Debt instruments that the Company has utilized include its revolving credit facility, the TILC warehouse facility, senior notes, convertible subordinated notes, asset-backed securities, and sale-leaseback transactions. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities balances of $870.9 million, and $508.4 million available under its revolving credit facility. In April 2015, the TILC warehouse facility was increased to $1 billion and extended through April 2018. Under the renewed facility, $735.7 million was unused and available as of December 31, 2015 based on the amount of warehouse-eligible, unpledged equipment. The Company believes it has access to adequate capital resources to fund operating requirements and is an active participant in the capital markets.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had letters of credit issued under our revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $91.6 million, of which $90.3 million is expected to expire in 2016 and the remainder in 2017. The majority of our letters of credit obligations support the Company's various insurance programs and generally renew each year. See Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our corporate revolving credit facility.\nAs described further in Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company posted a supersedeas bond in the amount of $686.0 million related to its Highway Products litigation. The Company obtained the supersedeas bond on an unsecured basis for an initial annual premium of $3.9 million. Additionally, at December 31, 2015 the Company has outstanding surety bonds in the amount of $66.1 million issued to support our operations and, as required under the terms of certain customer agreements, to guarantee our performance.\nSee Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about off balance sheet arrangements with regard to our Leasing Group.\nDerivative Instruments\nWe may use derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates, both in anticipation of future debt issuances and to offset interest rate variability of certain floating rate debt issuances outstanding. We also may use derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of changes in natural gas and diesel fuel prices and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For derivative instruments designated as hedges, the Company formally documents the relationship between the derivative instrument and the hedged item, as well as the risk management objective and strategy for the use of the derivative instrument. This documentation includes linking the derivatives that are designated as fair value or cash flow hedges to specific assets or liabilities on the balance sheet, commitments, or forecasted transactions. At the time a derivative instrument is entered into, and at least quarterly thereafter, the Company assesses whether the derivative instrument is effective in offsetting the changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. Any change in fair value resulting in ineffectiveness, as defined by accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\"), is recognized in current period earnings. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss (\"AOCL\") as a separate component of stockholders' equity and reclassified into earnings in the period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Trinity monitors its derivative positions and the credit ratings of its counterparties and does not anticipate losses due to counterparties' non-performance. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of how the Company valued its commodity hedges and interest rate swaps at December 31, 2015. See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company's debt instruments.\nInterest rate hedges\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Included in accompanying balance sheet\nat December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Notional\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Interest\nRate(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Liability\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>AOCL -\nloss/\n(income)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Noncontrolling\nInterest\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions, except %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expired hedges:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2006 secured railcar equipment notes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>200.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.87\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>TRIP Holdings warehouse loan\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>788.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.60\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Open hedges:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>TRIP Master Funding secured railcar equipment notes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.62\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 59: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Weighted average fixed interest rate\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Effect on interest expense-increase/(decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Expected effect during next twelve months(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expired hedges:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2006 secured railcar equipment notes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Promissory notes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>TRIP Holdings warehouse loan\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Open hedges:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>TRIP Master Funding secured railcar equipment notes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Promissory notes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Based on the fair value of open hedges as of December 31, 2015\nDuring 2005 and 2006, we entered into interest rate swap derivatives in anticipation of issuing our 2006 Secured Railcar Equipment Notes. These derivative instruments, with a notional amount of $200.0 million, were settled in 2006 and fixed the interest rate on a portion of the related debt issuance. These derivative instrument transactions are being accounted for as cash flow hedges with changes in the fair value of the instruments of $4.5 million in income recorded in AOCL through the date the related debt issuance closed in 2006. The balance is being amortized over the term of the related debt. The effect on interest expense is due to amortization of the AOCL balance.\nDuring 2006 and 2007, we entered into interest rate swap derivatives in anticipation of issuing our Promissory Notes. These derivative instruments, with a notional amount of $370.0 million, were settled in 2008 and fixed the interest rate on a portion of\nthe related debt issuance. These derivative instrument transactions were being accounted for as cash flow hedges with changes in the fair value of the instruments of $24.5 million recorded as a loss in AOCL through the date the related debt issuance closed in 2008. The balance was being amortized over the term of the related debt. These derivative instruments were fully amortized in May 2015. The effect on interest expense is due to amortization of the AOCL balance.\nIn 2008, we entered into an interest rate swap derivative instrument to fix the variable Libor component of the Promissory Notes. This derivative instrument expired in May 2015 and was being accounted for as a cash flow hedge. The effect on interest expense is primarily from a result of monthly interest settlements.\nBetween 2007 and 2009, TRIP Holdings, as required by the TRIP Warehouse Loan, entered into interest rate swap derivatives, all of which qualified as cash flow hedges, to reduce the effect of changes in variable interest rates in the TRIP Warehouse Loan. In July 2011, these interest rate hedges were terminated in connection with the refinancing of the TRIP Warehouse Loan. Balances included in AOCL at the date the hedges were terminated are being amortized over the expected life of the new debt with $4.8 million of additional interest expense expected to be recognized during the twelve months following December 31, 2015. Also in July 2011, TRIP Holdings' wholly-owned subsidiary, TRIP Master Funding, entered into an interest rate swap derivative instrument, expiring in 2021, with an initial notional amount of $94.1 million to reduce the effect of changes in variable interest rates associated with the Class A-1b notes of the TRIP Master Funding secured railcar equipment notes. The effect on interest expense is primarily a result of monthly interest settlements.\nSee Note 11 Debt regarding the related debt instruments.\nOther Derivatives\nNatural gas and diesel fuel\nWe maintain a program to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in the price of natural gas and diesel fuel. The intent of the program is to protect our operating profit from adverse price changes by entering into derivative instruments. For those instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, any changes in their valuation are recorded directly to the consolidated statement of operations. The amount recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 for these instruments was a liability of $0.8 million. The effect of these hedges was to increase cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 by $1.1 million and $2.3 million, respectively. The effect on operating income for the year ended December 31, 2013 was not significant.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe have a stock-based compensation plan covering our employees and our Board of Directors. See Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nEmployee Retirement Plans\nAs disclosed in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the projected benefit obligations of the employee retirement plans exceeded the plans' assets by $22.5 million and $39.4 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The change was primarily due to a 46 basis point increase in the obligation discount rate assumption partially offset by a lower return on assets. We continue to sponsor an employee savings plan under the existing 401(k) plan that covers substantially all employees and includes both a company matching contribution and an annual retirement contribution of up to 3% each of eligible compensation based on our performance, as well as a Supplemental Profit Sharing Plan. Both the annual retirement contribution and the company matching contribution are discretionary, requiring board approval, and made annually with the investment of the funds directed by the participants. Finally, with the acquisition of Meyer, the Company contributes to a multiemployer defined benefit pension plan under the terms of a collective-bargaining agreement that covers certain union-represented employees at one of Meyer's facilities.\nEmployer contributions for the year ending December 31, 2016 are expected to be $8.8 million for the defined benefit plans compared to $16.2 million contributed during 2015. Employer contributions to the 401(k) plans and the Supplemental Profit Sharing Plan for the year ending December 31, 2016 are expected to be $18.5 million compared to $16.3 million contributed during 2015. Employer contributions for the year ending December 31, 2016 are expected to be $2.4 million for the multiemployer plan compared to $2.5 million contributed during 2015.\nContractual Obligation and Commercial Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had the following contractual obligations and commercial commitments: Table 61: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 Year\nor Less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2-3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4-5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt and capital lease obligations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Parent and wholly-owned subsidiaries, excluding unamortized debt discount\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,793.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>103.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>335.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,302.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Partially-owned subsidiaries\n</td> <td>1,446.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>141.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,126.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>35.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest\n</td> <td>852.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>148.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>273.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>209.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>221.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>4,129.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>266.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>526.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>686.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,650.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leasing Group\n</td> <td>361.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>165.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>25.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Obligations for purchase of goods and services1\n</td> <td>874.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>866.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,394.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,186.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>624.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>764.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,819.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n1 Includes $744.5 million in purchase obligations for raw materials and components principally by the Rail, Inland Barge, and Energy Equipment Groups.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had $77.7 million and $73.9 million, respectively, of tax liabilities, including interest and penalties, related to uncertain tax positions. Because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with these liabilities, we are unable to estimate the years in which settlement will occur with the respective taxing authorities. See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to bad debts, inventories, property, plant, and equipment, goodwill, income taxes, warranty obligations, insurance, restructuring costs, contingencies, and litigation. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nInventory\nWe state all our inventories at the lower of cost or market. Our policy related to excess and obsolete inventory requires an analysis of inventory at the business unit level on a quarterly basis and the recording of any required adjustments. In assessing the ultimate realization of inventories, we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with the current or committed inventory levels. It is possible that changes in required inventory reserves may occur in the future due to then current market conditions.\nLong-lived Assets\nWe periodically evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used for potential impairment. The carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used is considered impaired only when the carrying value is not recoverable through undiscounted future cash flows and the fair value of the assets is less than their carrying value. Fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks involved or market quotes as available. Impairment losses on long-lived assets held for sale are determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced by the estimated cost to dispose of the assets.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually, or on an interim basis, whenever events or circumstances change, indicating that the carrying amount of the goodwill might be impaired. The quantitative goodwill impairment test is a two-step process with step one requiring the comparison of the reporting unit's estimated fair value with the carrying amount of its net assets. If necessary, step two of the impairment test determines the amount of goodwill impairment to be recorded when the reporting unit's recorded net assets exceed its fair value. Impairment is assessed at the reporting unit\u201d level by applying a fair value-based test for each unit with recorded goodwill. The estimates and judgments that most significantly affect the fair value calculations are assumptions, consisting of level three inputs, related to revenue and operating profit growth, discount rates and exit multiples. Based on the Company's annual goodwill impairment test, performed at the reporting unit level as of December 31, 2015, the Company concluded that no impairment charges were determined to be necessary and that none of the reporting units evaluated was at risk of failing the first step of the goodwill impairment test. A reporting unit is considered to be at risk if its estimated fair value does not exceed the carrying value of its net assets by 10% or more. See Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further explanation.\nGiven the uncertainties of the economy and its potential impact on our businesses, there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions regarding the fair value of our reporting units, made for the purposes of the long-lived asset and goodwill impairment tests, will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. If our assumptions regarding forecasted cash flows are not achieved, it is possible that impairments of remaining goodwill and long-lived assets may be required.\nWarranties\nThe Company provides warranties against materials and manufacturing defects generally ranging from one to five years depending on the product. The warranty costs are estimated using a two-step approach. First, an engineering estimate is made for the cost of all claims that have been asserted by customers. Second, based on historical claims experience, a cost is accrued for all products still within a warranty period for which no claims have been filed. The Company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized related to products covered by warranties and assesses the adequacy of the resulting reserves on a quarterly basis. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInsurance\nWe are effectively self-insured for workers' compensation claims. A third-party administrator processes all such claims. We accrue our workers' compensation liability based upon independent actuarial studies. To the extent actuarial assumptions change and claims experience rates differ from historical rates, our liability may change.\nContingencies and Litigation\nThe Company is involved in claims and lawsuits incidental to our business. Based on information currently available with respect to such claims and lawsuits, including information on claims and lawsuits as to which the Company is aware but for which the Company has not been served with legal process, it is management's opinion that the ultimate outcome of all such claims and litigation, including settlements, in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's overall financial condition for purposes of financial reporting. However, resolution of certain claims or lawsuits by settlement or otherwise, could impact the operating results of the reporting period in which such resolution occurs. See Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further explanation.\nEnvironmental\nWe are involved in various proceedings related to environmental matters. We have provided reserves to cover probable and estimable liabilities with respect to such proceedings, taking into account currently available information and our contractual rights of indemnification. However, estimates of future response costs are necessarily imprecise. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will not become involved in future litigation or other proceedings or, if we were found to be responsible or liable in any litigation or proceeding, that such costs would not be material to us.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by ASC 740. See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and other tax attributes using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the provision for income taxes in the period that includes the enactment date. Management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted law and tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. The Company assesses whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses; a forecast of future profitability; the duration of statutory carryback and carryforward periods; the Company's experience with tax attributes expiring unused; and tax planning alternatives.\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company had $30.7 million of federal consolidated net operating loss carryforwards and $5.3 million of tax-effected state loss carryforwards remaining. The federal net operating loss carryforwards were acquired as part of an acquisition of a company in 2010 and are subject to limitations on the amount that can be utilized in any one tax year. The federal net operating loss carryforwards are due to expire in 2028 and 2029. We have established a valuation allowance for federal, state, and foreign tax operating losses and credits which we have estimated may not be realizable. We believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize the remaining deferred tax assets.\nAt times, we may claim tax benefits that may be challenged by a tax authority. We recognize tax benefits only for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement. A liability for unrecognized tax benefits\u201d is recorded for any tax benefits claimed in our tax returns that do not meet these recognition and measurement standards.\nPensions\nThe Company sponsors defined benefit plans which provide retirement income and death benefits for certain eligible employees. The Company's pension costs and liabilities are primarily determined using actuarial assumptions regarding the long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used to determine the present value of future benefit obligations. The compensation increase rate assumption pertains solely to the pension plan of the Company's Inland Barge segment which was closed to new participants in 2014. The accrued benefits of the Company's remaining pension plans were frozen in 2009.\nPension assumptions are reviewed annually by outside actuaries and the Company's management. These actuarial assumptions are summarized in the following table:\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at the annual measurement date were:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Obligation discount rate\n</td> <td>4.79\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.33\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.22\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Compensation increase rate\n</td> <td>4.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit costs were:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Obligation discount rate\n</td> <td>4.33\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.22\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term rate of return on plan assets\n</td> <td>7.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.75\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.75\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Compensation increase rate\n</td> <td>4.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe obligation discount rate assumption is determined by deriving a single discount rate from a theoretical settlement portfolio of high quality corporate bonds sufficient to provide for the plans' projected benefit payments. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is an assumption reflecting the anticipated weighted average rate of earnings on the portfolio over the long-term. To arrive at this rate, estimates were developed based upon the anticipated performance of the plans' assets. The effect of a change in either of these assumptions on the net retirement cost for the year ended December 31, 2015 and on the projected benefit obligations at December 31, 2015 is summarized as follows:\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Effect on Net Retirement Cost for the Year Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Effect on Projected Benefit Obligations at December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assumptions:\n</td> <td>Increase/(decrease)\n(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Obligation discount rate:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase of 50 basis points\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(27.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease of 50 basis points\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term rate of return on plan assets:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase of 50 basis points\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease of 50 basis points\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about recent accounting pronouncements.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis annual report on Form 10-K (or statements otherwise made by the Company or on the Company's behalf from time to time in other reports, filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d), news releases, conferences, World Wide Web postings or otherwise) contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

We operate in five distinct business groups which we report on a segment basis: the Rail Group, Construction Products Group, Inland Barge Group, Energy Equipment Group, and Railcar Leasing and Management Services Group. We also report the All Other segment which includes the Company's captive insurance and transportation companies; legal, environmental, and maintenance costs associated with non-operating facilities; and other peripheral businesses.\nOur Rail and Inland Barge Groups and our structural wind towers, utility structures, and storage and distribution containers businesses operate in cyclical industries. Additionally, results in our Construction Products Group are affected by seasonal fluctuations with the first quarter historically being the weakest quarter. Railcar sales from the lease fleet are the primary driver of fluctuations in results in the Railcar Leasing and Management Services Group.\nDuring the most recent year, an increased level of uncertainty in the macro-economic environment reduced the pace of new order volumes in certain of the Company's businesses. Over the last several years, many of our businesses benefitted from investment activity occurring in the upstream energy markets and a relatively high and stable price of oil. The extended downturn in the price of oil as well as other factors including, among others, the strong dollar and weakness across other commodity prices, has created uncertainty for our customers in their long-term capital planning processes. At the same time, demand fundamentals in the automotive, construction, petrochemical, and wind energy sectors are positive. As a result, the Company is experiencing a mixed demand environment. We continually assess our manufacturing capacity and are taking steps to align our production capacity with demand for our products.\nExecutive Summary\nThe Company's revenues for 2015 were $6.39 billion, representing an increase of 3.6% over last year. The increase in revenues for 2015, when compared to the previous year, resulted primarily from higher shipment volumes and higher pricing on railcars delivered by our Rail Group. Revenues in our Energy Equipment Group increased primarily due to an acquisition. Revenues increased slightly for our Inland Barge Group as a result of higher shipment volumes and product mix changes. In our Leasing Group, leasing and management revenues increased by 10.7% while revenues from railcar sales owned one year or less totaled $404.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared with $486.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Revenues in our Construction Products Group declined by 3.5% as higher acquisition-related revenues in our Aggregates business were more than offset by lower shipment volumes in our Highway Products business.\nOperating profit for 2015 increased by 15.0% to $1.44 billion compared to $1.25 billion last year. Operating margin improved to 22.5% in 2015 from 20.3% in 2014. Overall operating profit and margin grew for the year ended December 31, 2015, when compared with the prior year, primarily due to increased volumes in our Rail and Energy Equipment Groups as well as higher leasing and management revenues and higher railcar sales in our Leasing Group during the period. Selling, engineering, and administrative expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to higher legal and litigation-related expenses as well as increased compensation costs resulting from acquisitions and higher average headcount during the year. At December 31, 2015, the Company's overall headcount, including both production and non-production personnel, decreased slightly from the end of 2014.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014 our backlog of firm and noncancellable orders was as follows:\nTable 38: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rail Group\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>External Customers\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,948.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,204.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leasing Group\n</td> <td>1,452.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,010.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,401.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,214.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inland Barge Group\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>416.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>437.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wind towers\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>371.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>473.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, our rail manufacturing businesses received orders for 22,145 railcars. The change in backlog as of December 31, 2015 compared with our backlog as of December 31, 2014 reflects the value of orders taken and orders delivered during the year. The orders in our backlog from the Leasing Group are fully supported by lease commitments with external customers. The final amount dedicated to the Leasing Group may vary by the time of delivery as customers may alternatively choose to purchase railcars as external sales from the Rail Group. Approximately 51% of our railcar backlog is expected to be delivered during the twelve months ending December 31, 2016 with the remainder to be delivered from 2017 through 2020. Substantially all of our Inland Barge and structural wind towers backlog is expected to be delivered during the twelve months ending December 31, 2016. The Company does not report backlog from its utility structures business because certain contracts contain partial order cancellation provisions.\nCapital expenditures for 2015 were $1,029.8 million with $833.8 million utilized for net lease fleet additions, net of deferred profit of $259.6 million. Manufacturing and corporate capital expenditures for 2016 are projected to be between $150.0 million and $200.0 million. For 2016, we expect the annual net cash investment in new railcars in our lease fleet to be approximately $385.0 million after considering the expected proceeds received from leased railcar sales during the year.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company received proceeds from the sale of leased railcars to Element Financial Corporation (\"Element\") under the strategic alliance with Element announced in December 2013 as follows:\nTable 39: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leasing Group:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Railcars owned one year or less at the time of sale\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>228.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>446.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Railcars owned more than one year at the time of sale\n</td> <td>294.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>235.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rail Group\n</td> <td>227.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>200.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>750.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>882.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSince the inception of our alliance in December 2013, the Company has received proceeds of $1,738.5 million from the sale of leased railcars to Element. In October 2015, the Company and Element announced a $1 billion extension of the alliance through December 2019.\nIn February 2015, our Leasing Group purchased all of the railcars that previously had been leased to the Leasing Group from one of the independent owner trusts for $121.1 million, resulting in the termination of the selling trust and the Leasing Group's remaining future operating lease obligations to the selling trust totaling $105.8 million. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of lease arrangements with the independent owner trusts.\nIn March 2015, we completed the acquisition of the assets of a lightweight aggregates business in our Construction Products Group with facilities located in Louisiana, Alabama, and Arkansas for a purchase price of $46.2 million.\nIn April 2015, the TILC warehouse loan facility was increased to $1 billion and extended through April 2018. Borrowings under the facility totaled $264.3 million as of December 31, 2015. Under the renewed facility, $735.7 million was unused and available as of December 31, 2015 based on the amount of warehouse-eligible, unpledged equipment.\nIn May 2015, we renewed and extended our unsecured corporate revolving credit facility through May 2020, increasing the size of the facility from $425.0 million to $600.0 million. Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a defined index rate plus a margin and are guaranteed by certain 100%-owned subsidiaries of the Company. As of December 31, 2015, we had letters of credit issued under our revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $91.6 million, leaving $508.4 million available for borrowing.\nIn May 2015, Trinity Rail Leasing VI LLC (\"TRL VI\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company owned through TILC, repaid its Promissory Notes in full for approximately $340.0 million. The Promissory Notes were issued by TRL VI in 2008 and secured by a diversified portfolio of leased railcars and certain cash reserves. The Promissory Notes had an effective interest rate of 5.63%,\nafter consideration of interest rate hedges. Per the original terms of the Promissory Notes, the borrowing margin was scheduled to increase by 0.50% in May 2015.\nIn May 2015, the Company declared an increase in its quarterly dividend from $0.10 to $0.11 per share, reflecting a 10% increase. Additionally, at the Company's Annual Meeting of Stockholders in May 2015, the Company's stockholders approved amendments to the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, increasing the number of authorized shares of common stock from 200 million to 400 million and reducing the par value of the Company's common stock to $0.01 per share from $1.00 per share.\nIn June 2015, we sold the assets of our galvanizing business for $51.3 million which included six facilities in Texas, Mississippi, and Louisiana. The assets and results of operations for this divestiture were previously included in the Construction Products Group.\nIn December 2015, the Company's Board of Directors renewed its $250 million share repurchase program effective January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2017. The new program replaced the previous program which expired on December 31, 2015. Under the previous program, 3,947,320 shares were repurchased during the year ended December 31, 2015, at a cost of $115.0 million.\nA current summary of the Company's Highway Products litigation is provided in Note 18 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nResults of Operations\nYears Ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013\nOverall Summary for Continuing Operations\nRevenues\nTable 40: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent Change 2015 versus 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>External\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Intersegment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rail Group\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,236.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,225.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,461.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction Products Group\n</td> <td>520.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>532.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inland Barge Group\n</td> <td>652.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>652.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Energy Equipment Group\n</td> <td>883.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>230.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,113.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Railcar Leasing and Management Services Group\n</td> <td>1,091.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,104.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All Other\n</td> <td>7.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment Totals before Eliminations\n</td> <td>6,392.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,585.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,978.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Eliminations -

We also experienced overall higher volumes in our Inland Barge Group; and in our Energy Equipment Group, primarily as a result of an acquisition in 2014. Revenues from the Construction Products Group declined as a result of lower revenues from our Highway Products business partially offset by higher acquisition-related volumes in our Aggregates business. Our Leasing Group experienced lower revenues from external sales of railcars owned one year or less, partially offset by higher leasing and management revenues due to increased rental rates and net lease fleet additions.\nOur revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014, increased by 41.3% from the previous year. The increase resulted primarily from higher shipment volumes and pricing due to increased overall demand and a more favorable product mix in our Rail Group combined with the effects of higher volumes in our Construction Products, Inland Barge, and Energy Equipment Groups. In addition to higher volumes, revenues from our Inland Barge Group increased as a result of favorable product mix changes while an increase in revenues from our Energy Equipment Group was primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2014. Our Leasing Group experienced higher leasing and management revenues due to increased rental rates and higher utilization as well as higher external railcar sales owned one year or less.\nOperating Costs\nOperating costs are comprised of cost of revenues; selling, engineering, and administrative costs; and gains or losses on property disposals.\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rail Group\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,530.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,092.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,377.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction Products Group\n</td> <td>478.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>486.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>472.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inland Barge Group\n</td> <td>535.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>524.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>480.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Energy Equipment Group\n</td> <td>962.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>884.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>604.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Railcar Leasing and Management Services Group\n</td> <td>498.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>602.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>348.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All Other\n</td> <td>120.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>136.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment Totals before Eliminations and Corporate Expenses\n</td> <td>6,126.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,725.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,383.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate\n</td> <td>152.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Eliminations - Lease subsidiary\n</td> <td>(904.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(577.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(621.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Eliminations - Other\n</td> <td>(420.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(348.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(243.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,953.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,919.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,592.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by 1.0% over the previous year primarily due to higher shipment levels in our Rail Group as well as acquisition-related increases in our Energy Equipment Group.

Selling, engineering, and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher legal and litigation-related expenses as well as increased compensation costs resulting from acquisitions and higher average headcount during the year. For 2014, the 36.9% increase in operating costs over the previous year was primarily due to higher shipment levels in our manufacturing segments and higher railcar sales in our Leasing Group. Selling, engineering, and administrative expenses increased overall primarily due to higher performance-related compensation costs and higher average headcount in addition to increased legal and litigation-related expenses.

Operating profit in our Leasing Group increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 over the prior year period from higher leasing and management revenues as well as higher operating profit from railcar sales. Operating profit from railcar sales in our Leasing Group totaled $275.1 million and $228.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Operating profit in our Inland Barge Group was substantially unchanged while operating profit in the Construction Products Group decreased for the year ended December 31, 2015 when compared to the prior year, as higher volumes in our Aggregates business related to an acquisition in 2015 were more than offset by lower volumes in our Highway Products business.\nOur operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by 61.9% primarily as a result of higher shipments in our manufacturing segments as well as higher railcar sales in our Leasing Group.\nFor a further discussion of revenues, costs, and the operating results of individual segments, see Segment Discussion below.\nOther Income and Expense.

See Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further explanation of activities with respect to our partially-owned leasing subsidiaries. See Note 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of income taxes.\nIncome from continuing operations before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 was $1,241.1 million, $1,051.4 million, and $571.2 million, respectively, for U.S. operations, and $10.9 million, $12.6 million, and $19.3 million, respectively, for foreign operations, principally Mexico. The Company provides deferred income taxes on the unrepatriated earnings of its foreign operations where it results in a deferred tax liability.\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company had $30.7 million of federal consolidated net operating loss carryforwards and $5.3 million of tax-effected state loss carryforwards remaining. The federal net operating loss carryforwards were acquired as part of an acquisition of a company in 2010 and are subject to limitations on the amount that can be utilized in any one tax year. The federal net operating loss carryforwards are due to expire in 2028 and 2029. We have established a valuation allowance for federal, state, and foreign tax operating losses and credits that we have estimated may not be realizable.\nThe IRS field work for our 2006-2008 audit cycle and our 2009-2011 audit cycle have concluded and all issues have been agreed upon by us and the IRS. The issues that were a part of the mutual agreement process, previously disclosed have been agreed. As the cycles included years in which tax refunds were issued to us, the Joint Committee on Taxation is required to review the final\nrevenue agent report before the issues are effectively settled. For this reason, we cannot determine when the 2006-2008 or the 2009-2011 cycle will close and all issues formally settled.\nIncome tax payments, net of refunds, differ from the current provision primarily based on when estimated tax payments were due as compared to when the related income was earned and taxable. The Company's consolidated income tax position was a net receivable of $85.0 million and $48.3 million from federal, state, and foreign jurisdictions at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 totaled $326.8 million, $399.0 million, and $110.9 million, respectively.\nSegment Discussion\nRail

Approximately 75% of the increase in railcar revenue results from an increase in unit deliveries with the remainder due to improved pricing partially offset by product mix changes. Cost of revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 by 13.9% when compared with the prior year primarily due to an increase in unit deliveries partially offset by greater operating efficiencies.\nRevenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 by 33.1% when compared to 2013 with approximately 75% of the increase resulting from higher unit deliveries and the remainder of the increase due to improved pricing and product mix changes. Cost of revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 by 29.9% when compared with the prior year primarily due to an increase in unit deliveries.\nUnit decreases and lower prices decreased total backlog dollars by 25.1% when comparing December 31, 2015 to the prior year. The average selling price in the backlog at December 31, 2015 was 6.5% lower as compared to the previous year primarily due to product mix changes. Backlog increased when comparing 2014 versus 2013 due to unit increases and higher prices. The average selling price in the backlog at December 31, 2014 was 6.0% lower as compared to the previous year due to product mix changes. The backlog dedicated to the Leasing Group is supported by lease commitments with external customers. The final amount dedicated to the Leasing Group may vary by the time of delivery as customers may alternatively choose to purchase railcars as external sales from the Rail Group.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, railcar shipments included sales to the Leasing Group of $1,164.4 million with a deferred profit of $259.6 million, representing 8,760 railcars, compared to $710.1 million with a deferred profit of $133.1 million, representing 6,810 railcars, in the comparable period in 2014. Results for the year ended December 31, 2013, included sales to the Leasing Group of $756.5 million with a deferred profit of $135.4 million, representing 6,620 railcars. Sales to the Leasing Group and related profits are included in the operating results of the Rail Group but are eliminated in consolidation. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, railcar shipments included sales of leased railcars to third parties of $260.5 million and $243.2 million, respectively. There were no sales of leased railcars to third parties from the Rail Group during the year ended December 31, 2013.\nThe Leasing Group purchases a portion of our railcar production utilizing the Company's cash or alternatively, financing a portion of the purchase price through a non-recourse warehouse loan facility. Periodically, the Leasing Group refinances those borrowings through equipment financing transactions. In 2015, the Leasing Group purchased 25.5% of our railcar production compared to 22.5% in 2014.\nConstruction Products Group\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 versus 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014 versus 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Highway products\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>277.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>317.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>335.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aggregates\n</td> <td>192.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>152.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>62.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>532.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>551.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>525.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating costs:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenues\n</td> <td>407.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>430.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>409.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, engineering, and administrative costs\n</td> <td>81.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property disposition gains\n</td> <td>(10.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>65.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit margin\n</td> <td>10.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues decreased for the year ended December 31, 2015 by 3.5% compared to the same period in 2014.

Amortization of deferred profit on railcars sold from the Rail Group to the Leasing Group is included in the operating profits of the Leasing Group resulting in the recognition of depreciation expense based on the Company's original manufacturing cost of the railcars. Interest expense is not a component of operating profit and includes the effect of hedges. Intercompany interest expense is eliminated in consolidation and arises from Trinity's previous ownership of a portion of TRIP Holdings' Senior Secured Notes, which notes were retired in full in May 2013. See Note 11 Debt of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTotal revenues decreased by 1.2% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 due to a lower volume of railcar sales owned one year or less, partially offset by growth in leasing and management revenues. Half of the increase in leasing and management revenues was due to higher average rental rates with the remainder primarily due to net fleet additions.\nTotal revenues increased by 73.3% for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013 due to increased railcar sales. Forty-five percent of the increase in leasing and management revenues was due to higher average rental rates on renewals and 25% was due to net fleet additions with the remainder resulting from higher utilization and other fees.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Leasing Group received proceeds from the sale of leased railcars to Element Financial Corporation (\"Element\") under the strategic alliance with Element announced in December 2013 as follows:\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Railcars owned one year or less at the time of sale\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>228.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>446.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Railcars owned more than one year at the time of sale\n</td> <td>294.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>235.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>523.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>682.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn October 2015, the Company and Element announced a $1 billion extension of the alliance through December 2019.\nOperating profit increased by 17.4% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 due to higher profit from railcar sales and higher leasing and management operating profit. Leasing and management profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased due to higher average rental rates, net fleet additions, and decreased rent expense partially offset by higher depreciation and maintenance expense. In February 2015, the Leasing Group purchased all of the railcars which previously had been leased to the Company from one of the independent owner trusts. As a result of this purchase, rent expense decreased for the year ended December 31, 2015 when compared to 2014. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of lease arrangements with the independent owner trusts.\nOperating profit increased by 74.0% for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013 due to higher profit from railcar sales. Leasing and management profits increased primarily due to higher average rental rates in our lease fleet, partially offset by increased maintenance costs resulting from higher regulatory compliance activity for the year ended December 31, 2014 when compared to 2013. Selling, engineering, and administrative costs increased to $49.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $37.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily due to increased staffing and higher performance-related compensation costs.\nThe Leasing Group generally uses its non-recourse warehouse loan facility or cash to provide initial financing for a portion of the purchase price of the railcars. In April 2015, the TILC warehouse loan facility was increased to $1 billion and extended through April 2018. After initial financing, the Leasing Group generally obtains long-term financing for the railcars in the lease fleet through non-recourse asset-backed securities; long-term non-recourse operating leases pursuant to sales/leaseback transactions; long-term recourse debt such as equipment trust certificates; or third-party equity.

Cash flow provided by operating activities increased primarily due to higher operating profits in 2015.\nReceivables at December 31, 2015 were substantially unchanged from December 31, 2014 as a higher income tax receivable was offset by lower trade receivables in our Rail, Energy Equipment, and Construction Products Groups. Raw materials inventory at December 31, 2015 decreased by $106.8 million or 18.2% since December 31, 2014 primarily attributable to lower levels in our Rail Group from improved inventory management. Finished goods inventory at December 31, 2015 increased by $56.9 million or 30.8% since December 31, 2014 primarily due to higher inventory related to scheduled shipments in early 2016 in our Rail and Energy Equipment Groups. Accounts payable decreased by $78.6 million as a result of lower inventory levels, while accrued liabilities decreased by $169.6 million from December 31, 2014 due primarily to lower customer advances outstanding. We continually review reserves related to bad debt as well as the adequacy of lower of cost or market valuations related to accounts receivable and inventory.\nInvesting Activities. Net cash required by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $511.3 million compared to $814.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $1,029.8 million, of which $833.8 million were for additions to the lease fleet. This compares to $464.6 million of capital expenditures for the same period last year, of which $245.3 million were for additions to the lease fleet. Proceeds from the sale of property, plant, and equipment and other assets totaled $522.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, including railcar sales from the lease fleet owned more than one year at the time of sale totaling $514.6 million. This compares to $288.8 million for the same period in 2014, including railcar sales from the lease fleet owned more than one year at the time of sale totaling $265.8 million. Full-year manufacturing and corporate capital expenditures for 2016 are projected to range between $150.0 million and $200.0 million. For 2016, we expect the annual net cash investment in new railcars in our lease fleet to be approximately $385.0 million after considering the expected proceeds received from leased railcar sales during the year. Net cash required related to acquisitions amounted to $46.2 million and $714.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Proceeds from business divestitures totaled $51.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Additionally, we repurchased shares of the Company's stock under a share repurchase program as described further below.\nOther Investing and Financing Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company received proceeds from the sale of leased railcars to Element under the strategic alliance with Element announced in December 2013 as follows:\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leasing Group:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Railcars owned one year or less at the time of sale\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>228.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>446.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Railcars owned more than one year at the time of sale\n</td> <td>294.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>235.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rail Group\n</td> <td>227.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>200.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>750.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>882.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSince the inception of our alliance, the Company has received proceeds of $1,738.5 million from the sale of leased railcars to Element. In October 2015, the Company and Element announced a $1 billion extension of the alliance through December 2019.\nIn March 2015, we completed the acquisition of the assets of a lightweight aggregates business in our Construction Products Group with facilities located in Louisiana, Alabama, and Arkansas for a purchase price of $46.2 million.\nIn April 2015, the TILC warehouse loan facility was increased to $1 billion and extended through April 2018. The loan facility, established to finance railcars owned by TILC, had $264.3 million in outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2015. Under the renewed facility, $735.7 million was unused and available as of December 31, 2015 based on the amount of warehouse-eligible, unpledged equipment. The warehouse loan facility is a non-recourse obligation secured by a portfolio of railcars and operating leases, certain cash reserves, and other assets acquired and owned by the warehouse loan facility trust. The principal and interest of this indebtedness are paid from the cash flows of the underlying leases. Advances under the facility bear interest at a defined index rate plus a margin, for an all-in interest rate of 2.10% at December 31, 2015. Interest rate pricing remained unchanged under the renewed facility. Amounts outstanding at maturity, absent renewal, are payable under the renewed facility in April 2019.\nIn May 2015, TRL VI, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company owned through TILC, repaid the Promissory Notes in full for approximately $340.0 million. The Promissory Notes were issued by TRL VI in 2008 and secured by a diversified portfolio of leased railcars and certain cash reserves. The Promissory Notes had an effective interest rate of 5.63%, after consideration of interest rate hedges. Per the original terms of the Promissory Notes, the borrowing margin was scheduled to increase by 0.50% in May 2015.\nIn May 2015, we renewed and extended our unsecured corporate revolving credit facility through May 2020, increasing the size of the facility from $425.0 million to $600.0 million. As of December 31, 2015, we had letters of credit issued under our revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $91.6 million, leaving $508.4 million available for borrowing. Other than these letters of credit, there were no borrowings under our revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2015, or for the two year period then ended. Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a defined index rate plus a margin and are guaranteed by certain 100%-owned subsidiaries of the Company.\nIn December 2015, the Company's Board of Directors renewed its $250 million share repurchase program effective January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2017. The new program replaced the previous program which expired on December 31, 2015. Under the previous program, 3,947,320 shares were repurchased during the year ended December 31, 2015, at a cost of $115.0 million.\nIn May 2015, the Company declared an increase in its quarterly dividend from $0.10 to $0.11 per share, reflecting a 10% increase.\nIn June 2015, we sold the assets of our U.S. galvanizing business for $51.3 million which included six facilities in Texas, Mississippi, and Louisiana. The assets and results of operations for this divestiture were previously included in the Construction Products Group.\nDuring the most recent quarter, an increased level of uncertainty in the macro-economic environment reduced the pace of new order volumes in certain of the Company's businesses. Over the last several years, many of our businesses benefitted from investment activity occurring in the upstream energy markets and a relatively high and stable price of oil. The extended downturn in the price of oil as well as other factors including, among others, the strong dollar and weakness across other commodity prices, has created uncertainty for our customers in their long-term capital planning processes. At the same time, demand fundamentals in the automotive, construction, petrochemical, and wind energy sectors are positive. As a result, the Company is experiencing a mixed demand environment. We continually assess our manufacturing capacity and are taking steps to align our production capacity with demand for our products.\nEquity Investment\nSee Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about the Company's investment in partially-owned leasing subsidiaries.\nFuture Operating Requirements\nWe expect to finance future operating requirements with cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities; cash flows from operations; and, depending on market conditions, short-term debt, long-term debt, and equity. Debt instruments that the Company has utilized include its revolving credit facility, the TILC warehouse facility, senior notes, convertible subordinated notes, asset-backed securities, and sale-leaseback transactions. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities balances of $870.9 million, and $508.4 million available under its revolving credit facility. In April 2015, the TILC warehouse facility was increased to $1 billion and extended through April 2018. Under the renewed facility, $735.7 million was unused and available as of December 31, 2015 based on the amount of warehouse-eligible, unpledged equipment. The Company believes it has access to adequate capital resources to fund operating requirements and is an active participant in the capital markets.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had letters of credit issued under our revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $91.6 million, of which $90.3 million is expected to expire in 2016 and the remainder in 2017. The majority of our letters of credit obligations support the Company's various insurance programs and generally renew each year. See Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our corporate revolving credit facility.\nAs described further in Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company posted a supersedeas bond in the amount of $686.0 million related to its Highway Products litigation. The Company obtained the supersedeas bond on an unsecured basis for an initial annual premium of $3.9 million. Additionally, at December 31, 2015 the Company has outstanding surety bonds in the amount of $66.1 million issued to support our operations and, as required under the terms of certain customer agreements, to guarantee our performance.\nSee Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about off balance sheet arrangements with regard to our Leasing Group.\nDerivative Instruments\nWe may use derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates, both in anticipation of future debt issuances and to offset interest rate variability of certain floating rate debt issuances outstanding. We also may use derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of changes in natural gas and diesel fuel prices and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For derivative instruments designated as hedges, the Company formally documents the relationship between the derivative instrument and the hedged item, as well as the risk management objective and strategy for the use of the derivative instrument. This documentation includes linking the derivatives that are designated as fair value or cash flow hedges to specific assets or liabilities on the balance sheet, commitments, or forecasted transactions. At the time a derivative instrument is entered into, and at least quarterly thereafter, the Company assesses whether the derivative instrument is effective in offsetting the changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. Any change in fair value resulting in ineffectiveness, as defined by accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\"), is recognized in current period earnings. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss (\"AOCL\") as a separate component of stockholders' equity and reclassified into earnings in the period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Trinity monitors its derivative positions and the credit ratings of its counterparties and does not anticipate losses due to counterparties' non-performance. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of how the Company valued its commodity hedges and interest rate swaps at December 31, 2015. See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company's debt instruments.\nInterest rate hedges\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Included in accompanying balance sheet\nat December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Notional\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Interest\nRate(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Liability\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>AOCL -\nloss/\n(income)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Noncontrolling\nInterest\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions, except %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expired hedges:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2006 secured railcar equipment notes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>200.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.87\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>TRIP Holdings warehouse loan\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>788.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.60\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Open hedges:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>TRIP Master Funding secured railcar equipment notes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.62\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Weighted average fixed interest rate \nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Effect on interest expense-increase/(decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Expected effect during next twelve months(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expired hedges:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2006 secured railcar equipment notes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Promissory notes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>TRIP Holdings warehouse loan\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Open hedges:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>TRIP Master Funding secured railcar equipment notes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Promissory notes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Based on the fair value of open hedges as of December 31, 2015\nDuring 2005 and 2006, we entered into interest rate swap derivatives in anticipation of issuing our 2006 Secured Railcar Equipment Notes. These derivative instruments, with a notional amount of $200.0 million, were settled in 2006 and fixed the interest rate on a portion of the related debt issuance. These derivative instrument transactions are being accounted for as cash flow hedges with changes in the fair value of the instruments of $4.5 million in income recorded in AOCL through the date the related debt issuance closed in 2006. The balance is being amortized over the term of the related debt. The effect on interest expense is due to amortization of the AOCL balance.\nDuring 2006 and 2007, we entered into interest rate swap derivatives in anticipation of issuing our Promissory Notes. These derivative instruments, with a notional amount of $370.0 million, were settled in 2008 and fixed the interest rate on a portion of\nthe related debt issuance. These derivative instrument transactions were being accounted for as cash flow hedges with changes in the fair value of the instruments of $24.5 million recorded as a loss in AOCL through the date the related debt issuance closed in 2008. The balance was being amortized over the term of the related debt. These derivative instruments were fully amortized in May 2015. The effect on interest expense is due to amortization of the AOCL balance.\nIn 2008, we entered into an interest rate swap derivative instrument to fix the variable Libor component of the Promissory Notes. This derivative instrument expired in May 2015 and was being accounted for as a cash flow hedge. The effect on interest expense is primarily from a result of monthly interest settlements.\nBetween 2007 and 2009, TRIP Holdings, as required by the TRIP Warehouse Loan, entered into interest rate swap derivatives, all of which qualified as cash flow hedges, to reduce the effect of changes in variable interest rates in the TRIP Warehouse Loan. In July 2011, these interest rate hedges were terminated in connection with the refinancing of the TRIP Warehouse Loan. Balances included in AOCL at the date the hedges were terminated are being amortized over the expected life of the new debt with $4.8 million of additional interest expense expected to be recognized during the twelve months following December 31, 2015. Also in July 2011, TRIP Holdings' wholly-owned subsidiary, TRIP Master Funding, entered into an interest rate swap derivative instrument, expiring in 2021, with an initial notional amount of $94.1 million to reduce the effect of changes in variable interest rates associated with the Class A-1b notes of the TRIP Master Funding secured railcar equipment notes. The effect on interest expense is primarily a result of monthly interest settlements.\nSee Note 11 Debt regarding the related debt instruments.\nOther Derivatives\nNatural gas and diesel fuel\nWe maintain a program to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in the price of natural gas and diesel fuel. The intent of the program is to protect our operating profit from adverse price changes by entering into derivative instruments. For those instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, any changes in their valuation are recorded directly to the consolidated statement of operations. The amount recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 for these instruments was a liability of $0.8 million. The effect of these hedges was to increase cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 by $1.1 million and $2.3 million, respectively. The effect on operating income for the year ended December 31, 2013 was not significant.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe have a stock-based compensation plan covering our employees and our Board of Directors. See Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nEmployee Retirement Plans\nAs disclosed in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the projected benefit obligations of the employee retirement plans exceeded the plans' assets by $22.5 million and $39.4 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The change was primarily due to a 46 basis point increase in the obligation discount rate assumption partially offset by a lower return on assets. We continue to sponsor an employee savings plan under the existing 401(k) plan that covers substantially all employees and includes both a company matching contribution and an annual retirement contribution of up to 3% each of eligible compensation based on our performance, as well as a Supplemental Profit Sharing Plan. Both the annual retirement contribution and the company matching contribution are discretionary, requiring board approval, and made annually with the investment of the funds directed by the participants. Finally, with the acquisition of Meyer, the Company contributes to a multiemployer defined benefit pension plan under the terms of a collective-bargaining agreement that covers certain union-represented employees at one of Meyer's facilities.\nEmployer contributions for the year ending December 31, 2016 are expected to be $8.8 million for the defined benefit plans compared to $16.2 million contributed during 2015. Employer contributions to the 401(k) plans and the Supplemental Profit Sharing Plan for the year ending December 31, 2016 are expected to be $18.5 million compared to $16.3 million contributed during 2015. Employer contributions for the year ending December 31, 2016 are expected to be $2.4 million for the multiemployer plan compared to $2.5 million contributed during 2015.\nContractual Obligation and Commercial Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had the following contractual obligations and commercial commitments: Table 61: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 Year\nor Less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2-3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4-5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt and capital lease obligations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Parent and wholly-owned subsidiaries, excluding unamortized debt discount\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,793.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>103.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>335.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,302.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Partially-owned subsidiaries\n</td> <td>1,446.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>141.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,126.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>35.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest\n</td> <td>852.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>148.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>273.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>209.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>221.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>4,129.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>266.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>526.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>686.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,650.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leasing Group\n</td> <td>361.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>165.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>25.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Obligations for purchase of goods and services1\n</td> <td>874.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>866.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,394.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,186.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>624.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>764.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,819.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n1 Includes $744.5 million in purchase obligations for raw materials and components principally by the Rail, Inland Barge, and Energy Equipment Groups.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had $77.7 million and $73.9 million, respectively, of tax liabilities, including interest and penalties, related to uncertain tax positions. Because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with these liabilities, we are unable to estimate the years in which settlement will occur with the respective taxing authorities. See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to bad debts, inventories, property, plant, and equipment, goodwill, income taxes, warranty obligations, insurance, restructuring costs, contingencies, and litigation. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nInventory\nWe state all our inventories at the lower of cost or market. Our policy related to excess and obsolete inventory requires an analysis of inventory at the business unit level on a quarterly basis and the recording of any required adjustments. In assessing the ultimate realization of inventories, we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with the current or committed inventory levels. It is possible that changes in required inventory reserves may occur in the future due to then current market conditions.\nLong-lived Assets\nWe periodically evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used for potential impairment. The carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used is considered impaired only when the carrying value is not recoverable through undiscounted future cash flows and the fair value of the assets is less than their carrying value. Fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks involved or market quotes as available. Impairment losses on long-lived assets held for sale are determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced by the estimated cost to dispose of the assets.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually, or on an interim basis, whenever events or circumstances change, indicating that the carrying amount of the goodwill might be impaired. The quantitative goodwill impairment test is a two-step process with step one requiring the comparison of the reporting unit's estimated fair value with the carrying amount of its net assets. If necessary, step two of the impairment test determines the amount of goodwill impairment to be recorded when the reporting unit's recorded net assets exceed its fair value. Impairment is assessed at the reporting unit\u201d level by applying a fair value-based test for each unit with recorded goodwill. The estimates and judgments that most significantly affect the fair value calculations are assumptions, consisting of level three inputs, related to revenue and operating profit growth, discount rates and exit multiples. Based on the Company's annual goodwill impairment test, performed at the reporting unit level as of December 31, 2015, the Company concluded that no impairment charges were determined to be necessary and that none of the reporting units evaluated was at risk of failing the first step of the goodwill impairment test. A reporting unit is considered to be at risk if its estimated fair value does not exceed the carrying value of its net assets by 10% or more. See Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further explanation.\nGiven the uncertainties of the economy and its potential impact on our businesses, there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions regarding the fair value of our reporting units, made for the purposes of the long-lived asset and goodwill impairment tests, will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. If our assumptions regarding forecasted cash flows are not achieved, it is possible that impairments of remaining goodwill and long-lived assets may be required.\nWarranties\nThe Company provides warranties against materials and manufacturing defects generally ranging from one to five years depending on the product. The warranty costs are estimated using a two-step approach. First, an engineering estimate is made for the cost of all claims that have been asserted by customers. Second, based on historical claims experience, a cost is accrued for all products still within a warranty period for which no claims have been filed. The Company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized related to products covered by warranties and assesses the adequacy of the resulting reserves on a quarterly basis. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInsurance\nWe are effectively self-insured for workers' compensation claims. A third-party administrator processes all such claims. We accrue our workers' compensation liability based upon independent actuarial studies. To the extent actuarial assumptions change and claims experience rates differ from historical rates, our liability may change.\nContingencies and Litigation\nThe Company is involved in claims and lawsuits incidental to our business. Based on information currently available with respect to such claims and lawsuits, including information on claims and lawsuits as to which the Company is aware but for which the Company has not been served with legal process, it is management's opinion that the ultimate outcome of all such claims and litigation, including settlements, in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's overall financial condition for purposes of financial reporting. However, resolution of certain claims or lawsuits by settlement or otherwise, could impact the operating results of the reporting period in which such resolution occurs. See Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further explanation.\nEnvironmental\nWe are involved in various proceedings related to environmental matters. We have provided reserves to cover probable and estimable liabilities with respect to such proceedings, taking into account currently available information and our contractual rights of indemnification. However, estimates of future response costs are necessarily imprecise. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will not become involved in future litigation or other proceedings or, if we were found to be responsible or liable in any litigation or proceeding, that such costs would not be material to us.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by ASC 740. See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and other tax attributes using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the provision for income taxes in the period that includes the enactment date. Management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted law and tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. The Company assesses whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses; a forecast of future profitability; the duration of statutory carryback and carryforward periods; the Company's experience with tax attributes expiring unused; and tax planning alternatives.\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company had $30.7 million of federal consolidated net operating loss carryforwards and $5.3 million of tax-effected state loss carryforwards remaining. The federal net operating loss carryforwards were acquired as part of an acquisition of a company in 2010 and are subject to limitations on the amount that can be utilized in any one tax year. The federal net operating loss carryforwards are due to expire in 2028 and 2029. We have established a valuation allowance for federal, state, and foreign tax operating losses and credits which we have estimated may not be realizable. We believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize the remaining deferred tax assets.\nAt times, we may claim tax benefits that may be challenged by a tax authority. We recognize tax benefits only for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement. A liability for unrecognized tax benefits\u201d is recorded for any tax benefits claimed in our tax returns that do not meet these recognition and measurement standards.\nPensions\nThe Company sponsors defined benefit plans which provide retirement income and death benefits for certain eligible employees. The Company's pension costs and liabilities are primarily determined using actuarial assumptions regarding the long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used to determine the present value of future benefit obligations. The compensation increase rate assumption pertains solely to the pension plan of the Company's Inland Barge segment which was closed to new participants in 2014. The accrued benefits of the Company's remaining pension plans were frozen in 2009.\nPension assumptions are reviewed annually by outside actuaries and the Company's management. These actuarial assumptions are summarized in the following table:\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at the annual measurement date were:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Obligation discount rate\n</td> <td>4.79\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.33\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.22\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Compensation increase rate\n</td> <td>4.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit costs were:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Obligation discount rate\n</td> <td>4.33\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.22\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term rate of return on plan assets\n</td> <td>7.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.75\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.75\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Compensation increase rate\n</td> <td>4.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe obligation discount rate assumption is determined by deriving a single discount rate from a theoretical settlement portfolio of high quality corporate bonds sufficient to provide for the plans' projected benefit payments. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is an assumption reflecting the anticipated weighted average rate of earnings on the portfolio over the long-term. To arrive at this rate, estimates were developed based upon the anticipated performance of the plans' assets. The effect of a change in either of these assumptions on the net retirement cost for the year ended December 31, 2015 and on the projected benefit obligations at December 31, 2015 is summarized as follows:\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Effect on Net Retirement Cost for the Year Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Effect on Projected Benefit Obligations at December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assumptions:\n</td> <td>Increase/(decrease)\n(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Obligation discount rate:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase of 50 basis points\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(27.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease of 50 basis points\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term rate of return on plan assets:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase of 50 basis points\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease of 50 basis points\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about recent accounting pronouncements.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis annual report on Form 10-K (or statements otherwise made by the Company or on the Company's behalf from time to time in other reports, filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d), news releases, conferences, World Wide Web postings or otherwise) contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and certain other factors that may affect our future results. Our MD&A is presented in the following sections:\n\u2022Company Overview\n\u2022Executive Summary\n\u2022Results of Operations\n\u2022Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\u2022Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\n\u2022Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\u2022Recent Accounting Pronouncements\n\u2022Forward-Looking Statements\nOur MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCompany Overview\nTrinity Industries, Inc., headquartered in Dallas, Texas, is a diversified industrial company that owns market-leading businesses providing products and services to the energy, transportation, chemical, and construction sectors. We operate in five distinct business groups which we report on a segment basis: the Rail Group, Construction Products Group, Inland Barge Group, Energy Equipment Group, and Railcar Leasing and Management Services Group. We also report the All Other segment which includes the Company's captive insurance and transportation companies; legal, environmental, and maintenance costs associated with non-operating facilities; and other peripheral businesses.\nOur Rail and Inland Barge Groups and our structural wind towers, utility structures, and storage and distribution containers businesses operate in cyclical industries. Additionally, results in our Construction Products Group are affected by seasonal fluctuations with the first quarter historically being the weakest quarter. Railcar sales from the lease fleet are the primary driver of fluctuations in results in the Railcar Leasing and Management Services Group.\nDuring the most recent year, an increased level of uncertainty in the macro-economic environment reduced the pace of new order volumes in certain of the Company's businesses. Over the last several years, many of our businesses benefitted from investment activity occurring in the upstream energy markets and a relatively high and stable price of oil. The extended downturn in the price of oil as well as other factors including, among others, the strong dollar and weakness across other commodity prices, has created uncertainty for our customers in their long-term capital planning processes. At the same time, demand fundamentals in the automotive, construction, petrochemical, and wind energy sectors are positive. As a result, the Company is experiencing a mixed demand environment. We continually assess our manufacturing capacity and are taking steps to align our production capacity with demand for our products.\nExecutive Summary\nThe Company's revenues for 2015 were $6.39 billion, representing an increase of 3.6% over last year. The increase in revenues for 2015, when compared to the previous year, resulted primarily from higher shipment volumes and higher pricing on railcars delivered by our Rail Group. Revenues in our Energy Equipment Group increased primarily due to an acquisition. Revenues increased slightly for our Inland Barge Group as a result of higher shipment volumes and product mix changes. In our Leasing Group, leasing and management revenues increased by 10.7% while revenues from railcar sales owned one year or less totaled $404.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared with $486.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Revenues in our Construction Products Group declined by 3.5% as higher acquisition-related revenues in our Aggregates business were more than offset by lower shipment volumes in our Highway Products business.\nOperating profit for 2015 increased by 15.0% to $1.44 billion compared to $1.25 billion last year. Operating margin improved to 22.5% in 2015 from 20.3% in 2014. Overall operating profit and margin grew for the year ended December 31, 2015, when compared with the prior year, primarily due to increased volumes in our Rail and Energy Equipment Groups as well as higher leasing and management revenues and higher railcar sales in our Leasing Group during the period. Selling, engineering, and administrative expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to higher legal and litigation-related expenses as well as increased compensation costs resulting from acquisitions and higher average headcount during the year. At December 31, 2015, the Company's overall headcount, including both production and non-production personnel, decreased slightly from the end of 2014.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014 our backlog of firm and noncancellable orders was as follows:\n\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, our rail manufacturing businesses received orders for 22,145 railcars. The change in backlog as of December 31, 2015 compared with our backlog as of December 31, 2014 reflects the value of orders taken and orders delivered during the year. The orders in our backlog from the Leasing Group are fully supported by lease commitments with external customers. The final amount dedicated to the Leasing Group may vary by the time of delivery as customers may alternatively choose to purchase railcars as external sales from the Rail Group. Approximately 51% of our railcar backlog is expected to be delivered during the twelve months ending December 31, 2016 with the remainder to be delivered from 2017 through 2020. Substantially all of our Inland Barge and structural wind towers backlog is expected to be delivered during the twelve months ending December 31, 2016. The Company does not report backlog from its utility structures business because certain contracts contain partial order cancellation provisions.\nCapital expenditures for 2015 were $1,029.8 million with $833.8 million utilized for net lease fleet additions, net of deferred profit of $259.6 million. Manufacturing and corporate capital expenditures for 2016 are projected to be between $150.0 million and $200.0 million. For 2016, we expect the annual net cash investment in new railcars in our lease fleet to be approximately $385.0 million after considering the expected proceeds received from leased railcar sales during the year.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company received proceeds from the sale of leased railcars to Element Financial Corporation (\"Element\") under the strategic alliance with Element announced in December 2013 as follows:\n\nSince the inception of our alliance in December 2013, the Company has received proceeds of $1,738.5 million from the sale of leased railcars to Element. In October 2015, the Company and Element announced a $1 billion extension of the alliance through December 2019.\nIn February 2015, our Leasing Group purchased all of the railcars that previously had been leased to the Leasing Group from one of the independent owner trusts for $121.1 million, resulting in the termination of the selling trust and the Leasing Group's remaining future operating lease obligations to the selling trust totaling $105.8 million. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of lease arrangements with the independent owner trusts.\nIn March 2015, we completed the acquisition of the assets of a lightweight aggregates business in our Construction Products Group with facilities located in Louisiana, Alabama, and Arkansas for a purchase price of $46.2 million.\nIn April 2015, the TILC warehouse loan facility was increased to $1 billion and extended through April 2018. Borrowings under the facility totaled $264.3 million as of December 31, 2015. Under the renewed facility, $735.7 million was unused and available as of December 31, 2015 based on the amount of warehouse-eligible, unpledged equipment.\nIn May 2015, we renewed and extended our unsecured corporate revolving credit facility through May 2020, increasing the size of the facility from $425.0 million to $600.0 million. Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a defined index rate plus a margin and are guaranteed by certain 100%-owned subsidiaries of the Company. As of December 31, 2015, we had letters of credit issued under our revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $91.6 million, leaving $508.4 million available for borrowing.\nIn May 2015, Trinity Rail Leasing VI LLC (\"TRL VI\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company owned through TILC, repaid its Promissory Notes in full for approximately $340.0 million. The Promissory Notes were issued by TRL VI in 2008 and secured by a diversified portfolio of leased railcars and certain cash reserves. The Promissory Notes had an effective interest rate of 5.63%,\nafter consideration of interest rate hedges. Per the original terms of the Promissory Notes, the borrowing margin was scheduled to increase by 0.50% in May 2015.\nIn May 2015, the Company declared an increase in its quarterly dividend from $0.10 to $0.11 per share, reflecting a 10% increase. Additionally, at the Company's Annual Meeting of Stockholders in May 2015, the Company's stockholders approved amendments to the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, increasing the number of authorized shares of common stock from 200 million to 400 million and reducing the par value of the Company's common stock to $0.01 per share from $1.00 per share.\nIn June 2015, we sold the assets of our galvanizing business for $51.3 million which included six facilities in Texas, Mississippi, and Louisiana. The assets and results of operations for this divestiture were previously included in the Construction Products Group.\nIn December 2015, the Company's Board of Directors renewed its $250 million share repurchase program effective January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2017. The new program replaced the previous program which expired on December 31, 2015. Under the previous program, 3,947,320 shares were repurchased during the year ended December 31, 2015, at a cost of $115.0 million.\nA current summary of the Company's Highway Products litigation is provided in Note 18 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nResults of Operations\nYears Ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013\nOverall Summary for Continuing Operations\nRevenues\n\nOur revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, increased by 3.6% from the previous year primarily as a result of higher shipment volumes and pricing in our Rail Group partially offset by product mix changes. We also experienced overall higher volumes in our Inland Barge Group; and in our Energy Equipment Group, primarily as a result of an acquisition in 2014. Revenues from the Construction Products Group declined as a result of lower revenues from our Highway Products business partially offset by higher acquisition-related volumes in our Aggregates business. Our Leasing Group experienced lower revenues from external sales of railcars owned one year or less, partially offset by higher leasing and management revenues due to increased rental rates and net lease fleet additions.\nOur revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014, increased by 41.3% from the previous year. The increase resulted primarily from higher shipment volumes and pricing due to increased overall demand and a more favorable product mix in our Rail Group combined with the effects of higher volumes in our Construction Products, Inland Barge, and Energy Equipment Groups. In addition to higher volumes, revenues from our Inland Barge Group increased as a result of favorable product mix changes while an increase in revenues from our Energy Equipment Group was primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2014. Our Leasing Group experienced higher leasing and management revenues due to increased rental rates and higher utilization as well as higher external railcar sales owned one year or less.\nOperating Costs\nOperating costs are comprised of cost of revenues; selling, engineering, and administrative costs; and gains or losses on property disposals.\n\nOperating costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by 1.0% over the previous year primarily due to higher shipment levels in our Rail Group as well as acquisition-related increases in our Energy Equipment Group. Operating costs in our Leasing Group declined as a result of lower railcar sales owned one year or less during the year ended December 31, 2015 over the prior year in addition to higher gains from railcar sales owned more than one year in 2015 over the prior year. Selling, engineering, and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher legal and litigation-related expenses as well as increased compensation costs resulting from acquisitions and higher average headcount during the year. For 2014, the 36.9% increase in operating costs over the previous year was primarily due to higher shipment levels in our manufacturing segments and higher railcar sales in our Leasing Group. Selling, engineering, and administrative expenses increased overall primarily due to higher performance-related compensation costs and higher average headcount in addition to increased legal and litigation-related expenses. As a percentage of revenue, our selling, engineering, and administrative expenses were 7.5% for 2015 as compared to 6.5% for 2014 and 6.7% for 2013.\nOperating Profit (Loss)\n\nOur operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by 15.0% primarily as a result of higher shipment volumes in our Rail Group and acquisition-related improvements in our Energy Equipment Group. Rail Group operating profit also increased as a result of improved pricing and higher operating efficiencies partially offset by product mix changes. Operating profit in our Leasing Group increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 over the prior year period from higher leasing and management revenues as well as higher operating profit from railcar sales. Operating profit from railcar sales in our Leasing Group totaled $275.1 million and $228.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Operating profit in our Inland Barge Group was substantially unchanged while operating profit in the Construction Products Group decreased for the year ended December 31, 2015 when compared to the prior year, as higher volumes in our Aggregates business related to an acquisition in 2015 were more than offset by lower volumes in our Highway Products business.\nOur operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by 61.9% primarily as a result of higher shipments in our manufacturing segments as well as higher railcar sales in our Leasing Group.\nFor a further discussion of revenues, costs, and the operating results of individual segments, see Segment Discussion below.\nOther Income and Expense. Other income and expense is summarized in the following table:\n\nInterest expense in 2015 increased $1.3 million over the prior year primarily due to the issuance of the Company's Senior Notes in September 2014, partially offset by the repayment in full of the TRL VI Promissory Notes in May 2015. Interest expense in 2014 increased $6.1 million over the prior year primarily due to the issuance of the Company's Senior Notes in September 2014.\nIncome Taxes. The provision for income taxes results in effective tax rates that differ from the statutory rates. The following is a reconciliation between the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate and the Company's effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations:\n\nOur effective tax rate reflects the Company's estimate for 2015 of its state income tax expense, the current tax benefit available for U.S. manufacturing activities, and income attributable to the noncontrolling interests in partially-owned leasing subsidiaries for which no income tax expense is provided. See Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further explanation of activities with respect to our partially-owned leasing subsidiaries. See Note 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of income taxes.\nIncome from continuing operations before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 was $1,241.1 million, $1,051.4 million, and $571.2 million, respectively, for U.S. operations, and $10.9 million, $12.6 million, and $19.3 million, respectively, for foreign operations, principally Mexico. The Company provides deferred income taxes on the unrepatriated earnings of its foreign operations where it results in a deferred tax liability.\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company had $30.7 million of federal consolidated net operating loss carryforwards and $5.3 million of tax-effected state loss carryforwards remaining. The federal net operating loss carryforwards were acquired as part of an acquisition of a company in 2010 and are subject to limitations on the amount that can be utilized in any one tax year. The federal net operating loss carryforwards are due to expire in 2028 and 2029. We have established a valuation allowance for federal, state, and foreign tax operating losses and credits that we have estimated may not be realizable.\nThe IRS field work for our 2006-2008 audit cycle and our 2009-2011 audit cycle have concluded and all issues have been agreed upon by us and the IRS. The issues that were a part of the mutual agreement process, previously disclosed have been agreed. As the cycles included years in which tax refunds were issued to us, the Joint Committee on Taxation is required to review the final\nrevenue agent report before the issues are effectively settled. For this reason, we cannot determine when the 2006-2008 or the 2009-2011 cycle will close and all issues formally settled.\nIncome tax payments, net of refunds, differ from the current provision primarily based on when estimated tax payments were due as compared to when the related income was earned and taxable. The Company's consolidated income tax position was a net receivable of $85.0 million and $48.3 million from federal, state, and foreign jurisdictions at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 totaled $326.8 million, $399.0 million, and $110.9 million, respectively.\nSegment Discussion\nRail Group\n\nAs of December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 our Rail Group backlog of railcars was as follows:\n\nThe changes in the number of railcars in the Rail Group backlog are as follows:\n\nRevenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 by 16.9% when compared to the prior year. Approximately 75% of the increase in railcar revenue results from an increase in unit deliveries with the remainder due to improved pricing partially offset by product mix changes. Cost of revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 by 13.9% when compared with the prior year primarily due to an increase in unit deliveries partially offset by greater operating efficiencies.\nRevenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 by 33.1% when compared to 2013 with approximately 75% of the increase resulting from higher unit deliveries and the remainder of the increase due to improved pricing and product mix changes. Cost of revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 by 29.9% when compared with the prior year primarily due to an increase in unit deliveries.\nUnit decreases and lower prices decreased total backlog dollars by 25.1% when comparing December 31, 2015 to the prior year. The average selling price in the backlog at December 31, 2015 was 6.5% lower as compared to the previous year primarily due to product mix changes. Backlog increased when comparing 2014 versus 2013 due to unit increases and higher prices. The average selling price in the backlog at December 31, 2014 was 6.0% lower as compared to the previous year due to product mix changes. The backlog dedicated to the Leasing Group is supported by lease commitments with external customers. The final amount dedicated to the Leasing Group may vary by the time of delivery as customers may alternatively choose to purchase railcars as external sales from the Rail Group.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, railcar shipments included sales to the Leasing Group of $1,164.4 million with a deferred profit of $259.6 million, representing 8,760 railcars, compared to $710.1 million with a deferred profit of $133.1 million, representing 6,810 railcars, in the comparable period in 2014. Results for the year ended December 31, 2013, included sales to the Leasing Group of $756.5 million with a deferred profit of $135.4 million, representing 6,620 railcars. Sales to the Leasing Group and related profits are included in the operating results of the Rail Group but are eliminated in consolidation. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, railcar shipments included sales of leased railcars to third parties of $260.5 million and $243.2 million, respectively. There were no sales of leased railcars to third parties from the Rail Group during the year ended December 31, 2013.\nThe Leasing Group purchases a portion of our railcar production utilizing the Company's cash or alternatively, financing a portion of the purchase price through a non-recourse warehouse loan facility. Periodically, the Leasing Group refinances those borrowings through equipment financing transactions. In 2015, the Leasing Group purchased 25.5% of our railcar production compared to 22.5% in 2014.\nConstruction Products Group\n\nRevenues decreased for the year ended December 31, 2015 by 3.5% compared to the same period in 2014. Higher revenues in our Aggregates business primarily related to an acquisition were more than offset by lower volumes in our Highway Products and other businesses including lower volumes from the sale of assets of our galvanizing business in June 2015. Similarly, cost of revenues decreased by 5.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the same period in 2014 as the effects of our Aggregates acquisition were more than offset by lower volumes in our Highway Products and other businesses. Additionally, cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014, included a $2.6 million gain from the settlement of certain liabilities related to Aggregates acquisitions in 2013. Selling, engineering, and administrative costs increased by 19.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 primarily due to higher legal expenses and compensation costs. The property disposition gains for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily related to the sale of assets of our galvanizing business.\nRevenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 by 5.1% compared to the same period in 2013. During the year ended December 31, 2014, slightly more than half of the 35.0% increase in revenues in our Aggregates business was due to the timing of acquisitions and the remainder was due to increased sales volume. The 5.4% decrease in Highway Products revenue resulted from lower sales volumes. Cost of revenues increased by 5.2% for the year ended December 31, 2014 when compared to the prior year due to higher volumes in our Aggregates business partially offset by a $2.6 million gain from the settlement of certain liabilities related to Aggregates acquisitions in 2013. Selling, engineering, and administrative costs increased by 7.1% for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 primarily due to higher compensation expenses. The property disposition gains for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily related to the sale of certain land held by our Aggregates business.\nInland Barge Group\n\nRevenues and cost of revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 by 2.3% compared to the same period in 2014 primarily from higher delivery volumes of hopper barges, partially offset by lower delivery volumes of tank barges. Selling, engineering, and administrative costs increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 due to higher compensation and consulting costs.\nRevenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 by 10.7% compared to the same period in 2013 with two-thirds of the increase resulting from higher delivery volumes and the remainder due to product mix changes. Cost of revenues increased at a lower rate than the increase in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 when compared to the same period in the prior year due to product mix changes. Selling, engineering, and administrative costs decreased for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 due to a legal reserve regarding a matter originating over ten years ago involving a foreign subsidiary recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2013 as well as decreased employee-related and consulting costs.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the backlog for the Inland Barge Group was $416.0 million compared to $437.9 million as of December 31, 2014. Deliveries for multi-year barge agreements are included in the backlog when specific production quantities for future years have been determined.\nEnergy Equipment Group\n\nRevenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by 12.2% compared to the same period in 2014. Revenues from our wind towers and utility structures product lines increased by 34.6% primarily due to an acquisition in 2014. Revenues from other product lines for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by 6.7% when compared to 2014 primarily as a result of changes in shipment volumes. Other revenues include results primarily from our storage and distribution containers and tank heads product lines. Cost of revenues increased by 8.6% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 while selling, engineering, and administrative costs increased by 11.0%. Substantially all of the increase in operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 was due to an acquisition.\nRevenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by 49.1% compared to the same period in 2013 with revenue from acquisitions completed during 2014 totaling $186.1 million and the remainder of the increase due to higher volumes. Revenues from our wind towers and utility structures product lines increased by 62.3% while other revenues increased by 39.6% for the year ended December 31, 2014. Cost of revenues increased by 45.0% for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013. Slightly less than two-thirds of the increase was due to acquisitions while the remainder of the increase was due to higher volumes. Selling, engineering, and administrative costs increased by 66.2% for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to acquisitions.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the backlog for wind towers was $371.3 million compared to $473.5 million as of December 31, 2014. The Company does not report backlog from its utility structures business because certain contracts contain partial order cancellation provisions.\nRailcar Leasing and Management Services Group\n\n* Not meaningful\n(1) Depreciation, maintenance, and rent expense are components of operating profit. Amortization of deferred profit on railcars sold from the Rail Group to the Leasing Group is included in the operating profits of the Leasing Group resulting in the recognition of depreciation expense based on the Company's original manufacturing cost of the railcars. Interest expense is not a component of operating profit and includes the effect of hedges. Intercompany interest expense is eliminated in consolidation and arises from Trinity's previous ownership of a portion of TRIP Holdings' Senior Secured Notes, which notes were retired in full in May 2013. See Note 11 Debt of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTotal revenues decreased by 1.2% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 due to a lower volume of railcar sales owned one year or less, partially offset by growth in leasing and management revenues. Half of the increase in leasing and management revenues was due to higher average rental rates with the remainder primarily due to net fleet additions.\nTotal revenues increased by 73.3% for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013 due to increased railcar sales. Forty-five percent of the increase in leasing and management revenues was due to higher average rental rates on renewals and 25% was due to net fleet additions with the remainder resulting from higher utilization and other fees.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Leasing Group received proceeds from the sale of leased railcars to Element Financial Corporation (\"Element\") under the strategic alliance with Element announced in December 2013 as follows:\n\nIn October 2015, the Company and Element announced a $1 billion extension of the alliance through December 2019.\nOperating profit increased by 17.4% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 due to higher profit from railcar sales and higher leasing and management operating profit. Leasing and management profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased due to higher average rental rates, net fleet additions, and decreased rent expense partially offset by higher depreciation and maintenance expense. In February 2015, the Leasing Group purchased all of the railcars which previously had been leased to the Company from one of the independent owner trusts. As a result of this purchase, rent expense decreased for the year ended December 31, 2015 when compared to 2014. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of lease arrangements with the independent owner trusts.\nOperating profit increased by 74.0% for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013 due to higher profit from railcar sales. Leasing and management profits increased primarily due to higher average rental rates in our lease fleet, partially offset by increased maintenance costs resulting from higher regulatory compliance activity for the year ended December 31, 2014 when compared to 2013. Selling, engineering, and administrative costs increased to $49.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $37.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily due to increased staffing and higher performance-related compensation costs.\nThe Leasing Group generally uses its non-recourse warehouse loan facility or cash to provide initial financing for a portion of the purchase price of the railcars. In April 2015, the TILC warehouse loan facility was increased to $1 billion and extended through April 2018. After initial financing, the Leasing Group generally obtains long-term financing for the railcars in the lease fleet through non-recourse asset-backed securities; long-term non-recourse operating leases pursuant to sales/leaseback transactions; long-term recourse debt such as equipment trust certificates; or third-party equity. See Other Investing and Financing Activities.\nInformation regarding the Leasing Group's lease fleet, owned through its wholly-owned and partially-owned subsidiaries, follows:\n\nAll Other\n\nRevenues were substantially unchanged for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease in operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 was due to overall improved efficiency from internal logistics operations, certain reserves recorded in 2014, and gains from certain property dispositions.\nRevenues increased by 27.5% for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013 due to increased revenues from our transportation company resulting from higher internal shipments. The increase in operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2014 was due to higher costs of facility maintenance activities, higher costs related to commodity hedges, and higher reserves.\nCorporate\n\nThe increase in operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily due to higher legal and litigation-related expenses as well as performance-related compensation costs and increased staffing compared to 2014.\nThe increase in operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013 is primarily due to higher performance-related compensation costs and increased staffing, increased legal expenses and approximately $8.7 million in one-time costs related to the acquisition of Meyer Utility Structures (\"Meyer\") for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for each of the last three years:\n\n2015 compared with 2014\nOperating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $939.7 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $819.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Cash flow provided by operating activities increased primarily due to higher operating profits in 2015.\nReceivables at December 31, 2015 were substantially unchanged from December 31, 2014 as a higher income tax receivable was offset by lower trade receivables in our Rail, Energy Equipment, and Construction Products Groups. Raw materials inventory at December 31, 2015 decreased by $106.8 million or 18.2% since December 31, 2014 primarily attributable to lower levels in our Rail Group from improved inventory management. Finished goods inventory at December 31, 2015 increased by $56.9 million or 30.8% since December 31, 2014 primarily due to higher inventory related to scheduled shipments in early 2016 in our Rail and Energy Equipment Groups. Accounts payable decreased by $78.6 million as a result of lower inventory levels, while accrued liabilities decreased by $169.6 million from December 31, 2014 due primarily to lower customer advances outstanding. We continually review reserves related to bad debt as well as the adequacy of lower of cost or market valuations related to accounts receivable and inventory.\nInvesting Activities. Net cash required by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $511.3 million compared to $814.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $1,029.8 million, of which $833.8 million were for additions to the lease fleet. This compares to $464.6 million of capital expenditures for the same period last year, of which $245.3 million were for additions to the lease fleet. Proceeds from the sale of property, plant, and equipment and other assets totaled $522.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, including railcar sales from the lease fleet owned more than one year at the time of sale totaling $514.6 million. This compares to $288.8 million for the same period in 2014, including railcar sales from the lease fleet owned more than one year at the time of sale totaling $265.8 million. Full-year manufacturing and corporate capital expenditures for 2016 are projected to range between $150.0 million and $200.0 million. For 2016, we expect the annual net cash investment in new railcars in our lease fleet to be approximately $385.0 million after considering the expected proceeds received from leased railcar sales during the year. Net cash required related to acquisitions amounted to $46.2 million and $714.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Proceeds from business divestitures totaled $51.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Short-term marketable securities for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased $9.9 million.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash required by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 was $530.3 million compared to $454.9 million of net cash provided by financing activities for the same period in 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we retired $587.2 million in debt including $340.0 million for the full repayment of promissory notes related\nto one of our wholly-owned leasing subsidiaries.We borrowed $242.4 million, net of debt issuance costs, during the year ended December 31, 2015, from our TILC warehouse loan facility. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we retired $186.6 million in debt as scheduled. We borrowed $727.3 million, net of debt issuance costs, during the year ended December 31, 2014, from the issuance of $400.0 million in senior notes and, the issuance by a wholly-owned subsidiary of TRIP Holdings of $335.7 million in secured equipment notes. Also, during the year ended December 31, 2014, we received $49.6 million in equity contributions from noncontrolling interests in one of the Company's partially-owned leasing subsidiaries. Additionally, we repurchased shares of the Company's stock under a share repurchase program as described further below. We intend to use our cash and committed credit facilities to fund the operations, expansions, and growth initiatives of the Company.\n2014 compared with 2013\nOperating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $819.2 million compared to $662.2 million of net cash provided by operating activities for the same period in 2013. Cash flow provided by operating activities increased primarily due to higher operating profits in 2014.\nReceivables at December 31, 2014 increased by $56.4 million or 15.1% from December 31, 2013, primarily due to an increase in income taxes receivable. Raw materials inventory at December 31, 2014 increased by $108.4 million or 22.7% since December 31, 2013 primarily attributable to higher levels in our Rail Group required to meet production demands. Finished goods inventory at December 31, 2014 increased by $48.5 million or 35.6% since December 31, 2013 primarily due to higher levels in our Rail and Energy Equipment Groups pending delivery. Accounts payable increased by $60.7 million to support higher inventory levels, while accrued liabilities increased by $82.1 million from December 31, 2013 due to higher customer advances which totaled $193.8 million at December 31, 2014.\nInvesting Activities. Net cash required by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $814.7 million compared to $818.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $464.6 million, of which $245.3 million were for additions to the lease fleet. This compares to $731.0 million of capital expenditures for the same period in 2013, of which $581.1 million were for additions to the lease fleet. Proceeds from the sale of property, plant, and equipment and other assets totaled $288.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, including railcar sales from the lease fleet owned more than one year at the time of sale totaling $265.8 million. This compares to $135.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, including railcar sales from the lease fleet owned more than one year at the time of sale totaling $131.6 million. Net cash required related to acquisitions amounted to $714.4 million and $73.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Short-term marketable securities for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased $74.7 million.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2014 was $454.9 million compared to $11.3 million of net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we retired $186.6 million in debt as scheduled. We borrowed $727.3 million, net of debt issuance costs, during the year ended December 31, 2014, from the issuance of $400 million in senior notes and the issuance by a wholly-owned subsidiary of TRIP Holdings of $335.7 million in secured equipment notes. Also, during the year ended December 31, 2014, we received $49.6 million in equity contributions from noncontrolling interests in one of the Company's partially-owned leasing subsidiaries. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we retired $262.1 million in debt principally consisting of the repayment of the Leasing Group term loan and the TRIP Holdings senior secured notes. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we borrowed $175.0 million, net of debt issuance costs, primarily from the issuance by TRL 2012 of its 2013-1 Secured Railcar Equipment Notes. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we received proceeds of $296.7 million related to the sale of equity interests in certain partially-owned leasing subsidiaries and we received $50.0 million in equity contributions from noncontrolling interests in one of the Company's partially-owned leasing subsidiaries. During 2013, TRIP Holdings repurchased the equity interests of certain equity investors for $84.0 million. Additionally, we repurchased shares of the Company's stock under a share repurchase program as described further below.\nOther Investing and Financing Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company received proceeds from the sale of leased railcars to Element under the strategic alliance with Element announced in December 2013 as follows:\n\nSince the inception of our alliance, the Company has received proceeds of $1,738.5 million from the sale of leased railcars to Element. In October 2015, the Company and Element announced a $1 billion extension of the alliance through December 2019.\nIn March 2015, we completed the acquisition of the assets of a lightweight aggregates business in our Construction Products Group with facilities located in Louisiana, Alabama, and Arkansas for a purchase price of $46.2 million.\nIn April 2015, the TILC warehouse loan facility was increased to $1 billion and extended through April 2018. The loan facility, established to finance railcars owned by TILC, had $264.3 million in outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2015. Under the renewed facility, $735.7 million was unused and available as of December 31, 2015 based on the amount of warehouse-eligible, unpledged equipment. The warehouse loan facility is a non-recourse obligation secured by a portfolio of railcars and operating leases, certain cash reserves, and other assets acquired and owned by the warehouse loan facility trust. The principal and interest of this indebtedness are paid from the cash flows of the underlying leases. Advances under the facility bear interest at a defined index rate plus a margin, for an all-in interest rate of 2.10% at December 31, 2015. Interest rate pricing remained unchanged under the renewed facility. Amounts outstanding at maturity, absent renewal, are payable under the renewed facility in April 2019.\nIn May 2015, TRL VI, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company owned through TILC, repaid the Promissory Notes in full for approximately $340.0 million. The Promissory Notes were issued by TRL VI in 2008 and secured by a diversified portfolio of leased railcars and certain cash reserves. The Promissory Notes had an effective interest rate of 5.63%, after consideration of interest rate hedges. Per the original terms of the Promissory Notes, the borrowing margin was scheduled to increase by 0.50% in May 2015.\nIn May 2015, we renewed and extended our unsecured corporate revolving credit facility through May 2020, increasing the size of the facility from $425.0 million to $600.0 million. As of December 31, 2015, we had letters of credit issued under our revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $91.6 million, leaving $508.4 million available for borrowing. Other than these letters of credit, there were no borrowings under our revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2015, or for the two year period then ended. Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a defined index rate plus a margin and are guaranteed by certain 100%-owned subsidiaries of the Company.\nIn December 2015, the Company's Board of Directors renewed its $250 million share repurchase program effective January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2017. The new program replaced the previous program which expired on December 31, 2015. Under the previous program, 3,947,320 shares were repurchased during the year ended December 31, 2015, at a cost of $115.0 million.\nIn May 2015, the Company declared an increase in its quarterly dividend from $0.10 to $0.11 per share, reflecting a 10% increase.\nIn June 2015, we sold the assets of our U.S. galvanizing business for $51.3 million which included six facilities in Texas, Mississippi, and Louisiana. The assets and results of operations for this divestiture were previously included in the Construction Products Group.\nDuring the most recent quarter, an increased level of uncertainty in the macro-economic environment reduced the pace of new order volumes in certain of the Company's businesses. Over the last several years, many of our businesses benefitted from investment activity occurring in the upstream energy markets and a relatively high and stable price of oil. The extended downturn in the price of oil as well as other factors including, among others, the strong dollar and weakness across other commodity prices, has created uncertainty for our customers in their long-term capital planning processes. At the same time, demand fundamentals in the automotive, construction, petrochemical, and wind energy sectors are positive. As a result, the Company is experiencing a mixed demand environment. We continually assess our manufacturing capacity and are taking steps to align our production capacity with demand for our products.\nEquity Investment\nSee Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about the Company's investment in partially-owned leasing subsidiaries.\nFuture Operating Requirements\nWe expect to finance future operating requirements with cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities; cash flows from operations; and, depending on market conditions, short-term debt, long-term debt, and equity. Debt instruments that the Company has utilized include its revolving credit facility, the TILC warehouse facility, senior notes, convertible subordinated notes, asset-backed securities, and sale-leaseback transactions. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities balances of $870.9 million, and $508.4 million available under its revolving credit facility. In April 2015, the TILC warehouse facility was increased to $1 billion and extended through April 2018. Under the renewed facility, $735.7 million was unused and available as of December 31, 2015 based on the amount of warehouse-eligible, unpledged equipment. The Company believes it has access to adequate capital resources to fund operating requirements and is an active participant in the capital markets.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had letters of credit issued under our revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $91.6 million, of which $90.3 million is expected to expire in 2016 and the remainder in 2017. The majority of our letters of credit obligations support the Company's various insurance programs and generally renew each year. See Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our corporate revolving credit facility.\nAs described further in Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company posted a supersedeas bond in the amount of $686.0 million related to its Highway Products litigation. The Company obtained the supersedeas bond on an unsecured basis for an initial annual premium of $3.9 million. Additionally, at December 31, 2015 the Company has outstanding surety bonds in the amount of $66.1 million issued to support our operations and, as required under the terms of certain customer agreements, to guarantee our performance.\nSee Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about off balance sheet arrangements with regard to our Leasing Group.\nDerivative Instruments\nWe may use derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates, both in anticipation of future debt issuances and to offset interest rate variability of certain floating rate debt issuances outstanding. We also may use derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of changes in natural gas and diesel fuel prices and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For derivative instruments designated as hedges, the Company formally documents the relationship between the derivative instrument and the hedged item, as well as the risk management objective and strategy for the use of the derivative instrument. This documentation includes linking the derivatives that are designated as fair value or cash flow hedges to specific assets or liabilities on the balance sheet, commitments, or forecasted transactions. At the time a derivative instrument is entered into, and at least quarterly thereafter, the Company assesses whether the derivative instrument is effective in offsetting the changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. Any change in fair value resulting in ineffectiveness, as defined by accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\"), is recognized in current period earnings. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss (\"AOCL\") as a separate component of stockholders' equity and reclassified into earnings in the period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Trinity monitors its derivative positions and the credit ratings of its counterparties and does not anticipate losses due to counterparties' non-performance. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of how the Company valued its commodity hedges and interest rate swaps at December 31, 2015. See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company's debt instruments.\nInterest rate hedges\n\n (1) Weighted average fixed interest rate \n\n(1)Based on the fair value of open hedges as of December 31, 2015\nDuring 2005 and 2006, we entered into interest rate swap derivatives in anticipation of issuing our 2006 Secured Railcar Equipment Notes. These derivative instruments, with a notional amount of $200.0 million, were settled in 2006 and fixed the interest rate on a portion of the related debt issuance. These derivative instrument transactions are being accounted for as cash flow hedges with changes in the fair value of the instruments of $4.5 million in income recorded in AOCL through the date the related debt issuance closed in 2006. The balance is being amortized over the term of the related debt. The effect on interest expense is due to amortization of the AOCL balance.\nDuring 2006 and 2007, we entered into interest rate swap derivatives in anticipation of issuing our Promissory Notes. These derivative instruments, with a notional amount of $370.0 million, were settled in 2008 and fixed the interest rate on a portion of\nthe related debt issuance. These derivative instrument transactions were being accounted for as cash flow hedges with changes in the fair value of the instruments of $24.5 million recorded as a loss in AOCL through the date the related debt issuance closed in 2008. The balance was being amortized over the term of the related debt. These derivative instruments were fully amortized in May 2015. The effect on interest expense is due to amortization of the AOCL balance.\nIn 2008, we entered into an interest rate swap derivative instrument to fix the variable Libor component of the Promissory Notes. This derivative instrument expired in May 2015 and was being accounted for as a cash flow hedge. The effect on interest expense is primarily from a result of monthly interest settlements.\nBetween 2007 and 2009, TRIP Holdings, as required by the TRIP Warehouse Loan, entered into interest rate swap derivatives, all of which qualified as cash flow hedges, to reduce the effect of changes in variable interest rates in the TRIP Warehouse Loan. In July 2011, these interest rate hedges were terminated in connection with the refinancing of the TRIP Warehouse Loan. Balances included in AOCL at the date the hedges were terminated are being amortized over the expected life of the new debt with $4.8 million of additional interest expense expected to be recognized during the twelve months following December 31, 2015. Also in July 2011, TRIP Holdings' wholly-owned subsidiary, TRIP Master Funding, entered into an interest rate swap derivative instrument, expiring in 2021, with an initial notional amount of $94.1 million to reduce the effect of changes in variable interest rates associated with the Class A-1b notes of the TRIP Master Funding secured railcar equipment notes. The effect on interest expense is primarily a result of monthly interest settlements.\nSee Note 11 Debt regarding the related debt instruments.\nOther Derivatives\nNatural gas and diesel fuel\nWe maintain a program to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in the price of natural gas and diesel fuel. The intent of the program is to protect our operating profit from adverse price changes by entering into derivative instruments. For those instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, any changes in their valuation are recorded directly to the consolidated statement of operations. The amount recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 for these instruments was a liability of $0.8 million. The effect of these hedges was to increase cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 by $1.1 million and $2.3 million, respectively. The effect on operating income for the year ended December 31, 2013 was not significant.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe have a stock-based compensation plan covering our employees and our Board of Directors. See Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nEmployee Retirement Plans\nAs disclosed in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the projected benefit obligations of the employee retirement plans exceeded the plans' assets by $22.5 million and $39.4 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The change was primarily due to a 46 basis point increase in the obligation discount rate assumption partially offset by a lower return on assets. We continue to sponsor an employee savings plan under the existing 401(k) plan that covers substantially all employees and includes both a company matching contribution and an annual retirement contribution of up to 3% each of eligible compensation based on our performance, as well as a Supplemental Profit Sharing Plan. Both the annual retirement contribution and the company matching contribution are discretionary, requiring board approval, and made annually with the investment of the funds directed by the participants. Finally, with the acquisition of Meyer, the Company contributes to a multiemployer defined benefit pension plan under the terms of a collective-bargaining agreement that covers certain union-represented employees at one of Meyer's facilities.\nEmployer contributions for the year ending December 31, 2016 are expected to be $8.8 million for the defined benefit plans compared to $16.2 million contributed during 2015. Employer contributions to the 401(k) plans and the Supplemental Profit Sharing Plan for the year ending December 31, 2016 are expected to be $18.5 million compared to $16.3 million contributed during 2015. Employer contributions for the year ending December 31, 2016 are expected to be $2.4 million for the multiemployer plan compared to $2.5 million contributed during 2015.\nContractual Obligation and Commercial Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had the following contractual obligations and commercial commitments: \n1 Includes $744.5 million in purchase obligations for raw materials and components principally by the Rail, Inland Barge, and Energy Equipment Groups.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had $77.7 million and $73.9 million, respectively, of tax liabilities, including interest and penalties, related to uncertain tax positions. Because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with these liabilities, we are unable to estimate the years in which settlement will occur with the respective taxing authorities. See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to bad debts, inventories, property, plant, and equipment, goodwill, income taxes, warranty obligations, insurance, restructuring costs, contingencies, and litigation. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nInventory\nWe state all our inventories at the lower of cost or market. Our policy related to excess and obsolete inventory requires an analysis of inventory at the business unit level on a quarterly basis and the recording of any required adjustments. In assessing the ultimate realization of inventories, we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with the current or committed inventory levels. It is possible that changes in required inventory reserves may occur in the future due to then current market conditions.\nLong-lived Assets\nWe periodically evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used for potential impairment. The carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used is considered impaired only when the carrying value is not recoverable through undiscounted future cash flows and the fair value of the assets is less than their carrying value. Fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks involved or market quotes as available. Impairment losses on long-lived assets held for sale are determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced by the estimated cost to dispose of the assets.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually, or on an interim basis, whenever events or circumstances change, indicating that the carrying amount of the goodwill might be impaired. The quantitative goodwill impairment test is a two-step process with step one requiring the comparison of the reporting unit's estimated fair value with the carrying amount of its net assets. If necessary, step two of the impairment test determines the amount of goodwill impairment to be recorded when the reporting unit's recorded net assets exceed its fair value. Impairment is assessed at the reporting unit\u201d level by applying a fair value-based test for each unit with recorded goodwill. The estimates and judgments that most significantly affect the fair value calculations are assumptions, consisting of level three inputs, related to revenue and operating profit growth, discount rates and exit multiples. Based on the Company's annual goodwill impairment test, performed at the reporting unit level as of December 31, 2015, the Company concluded that no impairment charges were determined to be necessary and that none of the reporting units evaluated was at risk of failing the first step of the goodwill impairment test. A reporting unit is considered to be at risk if its estimated fair value does not exceed the carrying value of its net assets by 10% or more. See Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further explanation.\nGiven the uncertainties of the economy and its potential impact on our businesses, there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions regarding the fair value of our reporting units, made for the purposes of the long-lived asset and goodwill impairment tests, will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. If our assumptions regarding forecasted cash flows are not achieved, it is possible that impairments of remaining goodwill and long-lived assets may be required.\nWarranties\nThe Company provides warranties against materials and manufacturing defects generally ranging from one to five years depending on the product. The warranty costs are estimated using a two-step approach. First, an engineering estimate is made for the cost of all claims that have been asserted by customers. Second, based on historical claims experience, a cost is accrued for all products still within a warranty period for which no claims have been filed. The Company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized related to products covered by warranties and assesses the adequacy of the resulting reserves on a quarterly basis. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInsurance\nWe are effectively self-insured for workers' compensation claims. A third-party administrator processes all such claims. We accrue our workers' compensation liability based upon independent actuarial studies. To the extent actuarial assumptions change and claims experience rates differ from historical rates, our liability may change.\nContingencies and Litigation\nThe Company is involved in claims and lawsuits incidental to our business. Based on information currently available with respect to such claims and lawsuits, including information on claims and lawsuits as to which the Company is aware but for which the Company has not been served with legal process, it is management's opinion that the ultimate outcome of all such claims and litigation, including settlements, in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's overall financial condition for purposes of financial reporting. However, resolution of certain claims or lawsuits by settlement or otherwise, could impact the operating results of the reporting period in which such resolution occurs. See Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further explanation.\nEnvironmental\nWe are involved in various proceedings related to environmental matters. We have provided reserves to cover probable and estimable liabilities with respect to such proceedings, taking into account currently available information and our contractual rights of indemnification. However, estimates of future response costs are necessarily imprecise. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will not become involved in future litigation or other proceedings or, if we were found to be responsible or liable in any litigation or proceeding, that such costs would not be material to us.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by ASC 740. See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and other tax attributes using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the provision for income taxes in the period that includes the enactment date. Management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted law and tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. The Company assesses whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses; a forecast of future profitability; the duration of statutory carryback and carryforward periods; the Company's experience with tax attributes expiring unused; and tax planning alternatives.\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company had $30.7 million of federal consolidated net operating loss carryforwards and $5.3 million of tax-effected state loss carryforwards remaining. The federal net operating loss carryforwards were acquired as part of an acquisition of a company in 2010 and are subject to limitations on the amount that can be utilized in any one tax year. The federal net operating loss carryforwards are due to expire in 2028 and 2029. We have established a valuation allowance for federal, state, and foreign tax operating losses and credits which we have estimated may not be realizable. We believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize the remaining deferred tax assets.\nAt times, we may claim tax benefits that may be challenged by a tax authority. We recognize tax benefits only for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement. A liability for unrecognized tax benefits\u201d is recorded for any tax benefits claimed in our tax returns that do not meet these recognition and measurement standards.\nPensions\nThe Company sponsors defined benefit plans which provide retirement income and death benefits for certain eligible employees. The Company's pension costs and liabilities are primarily determined using actuarial assumptions regarding the long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used to determine the present value of future benefit obligations. The compensation increase rate assumption pertains solely to the pension plan of the Company's Inland Barge segment which was closed to new participants in 2014. The accrued benefits of the Company's remaining pension plans were frozen in 2009.\nPension assumptions are reviewed annually by outside actuaries and the Company's management. These actuarial assumptions are summarized in the following table:\n\nThe obligation discount rate assumption is determined by deriving a single discount rate from a theoretical settlement portfolio of high quality corporate bonds sufficient to provide for the plans' projected benefit payments. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is an assumption reflecting the anticipated weighted average rate of earnings on the portfolio over the long-term. To arrive at this rate, estimates were developed based upon the anticipated performance of the plans' assets. The effect of a change in either of these assumptions on the net retirement cost for the year ended December 31, 2015 and on the projected benefit obligations at December 31, 2015 is summarized as follows:\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about recent accounting pronouncements.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis annual report on Form 10-K (or statements otherwise made by the Company or on the Company's behalf from time to time in other reports, filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d), news releases, conferences, World Wide Web postings or otherwise) contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
