This MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe acquire, own, and manage primarily single-tenant commercial real estate properties that are net leased on a long-term basis to a diversified group of tenants. Since our inception in 2007, we have selectively invested in net leased assets in the industrial, healthcare, restaurant, office, and retail property types, and as of December 31, 2019, our portfolio has grown to 645 properties in 41 U.S. states and one property in Canada.\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from rents received from single tenants of each of our net leased properties in our portfolio. We typically lease our properties pursuant to long-term net leases with initial terms of 10 years or more that often have renewal options. As of December 31, 2019, leases contributing approximately 98.4% of our ABR provided for periodic rent escalations, generally ranging from 1.5% to 2.5% annually, with an ABR weighted average minimum increase of 2.1%. As of December 31, 2019, our properties were occupied by approximately 186 different commercial tenants who operate 169 different brands that are diversified across 54 differing industries, with no single tenant accounting for more than 2.8% of our ABR.\nIn order to benefit from increasing economies of scale as we continue to grow, our board of directors made the decision to internalize our management structure, which was completed on February 7, 2020. In connection with the Internalization, we terminated our management agreements with BRE, entered into employment agreements with each of our named executive officers, and began directly employing 71 former employees of BRE. Our historical results of operations through December 31, 2019, include the payment of management fees that we will no longer pay following the Internalization and do not include the direct compensation expense associated with our 71 employees, or certain professional fees, consulting, portfolio servicing costs, and other general and administrative expenses not previously incurred based upon our externally managed structure. No amounts were payable to BRE under the termination provisions of the management agreements related to the Internalization.\nFactors that Affect Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nOur results of operations and financial condition are affected by numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. Key factors that impact our results of operations and financial condition include rental rates, lease renewals and occupancy, acquisition volume, net lease terms, financing arrangements and leverage, property dispositions, general and administrative expenses, inflation, and tenant bankruptcies.\nRental Rates\nOur ability to grow rental revenue from our existing portfolio will depend on our ability to realize the rental escalations built into our leases. As of December 31, 2019, leases contributing approximately 98.4% of our ABR provided for increases in future annual base rent, generally ranging from 1.5% to 2.5% annually, with an ABR weighted average minimum increase of 2.1% of base rent. Generally, our rent escalators increase rent on specified dates by a fixed percentage. Approximately 15.9% of our rent escalators are based on an increase in the CPI over a specified period and 1.6% of our leases are flat leases, meaning they do not provide for rent increases during their terms. During periods of low inflation, small increases in the CPI will result in limited increases in rental revenue from our leases that contain rent escalators based on CPI increases. However, when the CPI decreases or does not change over the relevant period, our rental revenue from such leases is not reduced and will remain the same.\nProperty Dispositions\nFrom time to time, we will strategically dispose of properties, primarily where we believe the risk profile has changed and become misaligned with our then current risk-adjusted return objectives. The resulting gains or losses on\ndispositions may materially impact our operating results. The recognition of a gain or loss on the sale of real estate varies from transaction to transaction based on fluctuations in asset prices and demand in the real estate market at the time a property is listed for sale.\nLease Renewals and Occupancy\nAs of December 31, 2019, the ABR weighted average remaining term of our leases was approximately 11.5 years, excluding renewal options. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 8.6% of our leases (based on ABR) will expire prior to January 1, 2025. See Item 1. Business, Our Leases\u201d. The stability of the rental revenue generated by our properties depends principally on our tenants' ability to pay rent and our ability to collect rents, renew expiring leases or re-lease space upon the expiration or other termination of leases, lease currently vacant properties, and maintain or increase rental rates at our leased properties. To the extent our properties become vacant, we would forego rental income while remaining responsible for the payment of property taxes and maintaining the property until it is re-leased, which could negatively impact our operating results. However, given our historically strong occupancy rates (since our inception, occupancy has generally been above 99%), we do not anticipate that such impact will be significant.\nAcquisition Volume\nOur historical growth in revenues and earnings has been achieved through rent escalations associated with existing in-place leases, coupled with rental income generated from accretive property acquisitions. Our ability to grow revenue will depend, to a significant degree, on our ability to acquire additional properties. Our ability to grow requires us to identify and complete acquisitions that meet our investment criteria. Changes in capitalization rates, interest rates, or other factors may impact our acquisition opportunities in the future. Market conditions may also impact the total returns we can achieve on our investments. Our acquisition volume also depends on our ability to access third-party debt and equity financing to fund our capital needs.\nNet Lease Terms\nSubstantially all of our leases are net leases pursuant to which our tenant generally is obligated to pay all expenses associated with the leased property including real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance, repairs, and capital costs. A limited number of leases require us to pay some or all of the property expenses such as the cost of environmental liabilities, roof and structure repairs, real estate taxes, insurance, or certain non-structural repairs and maintenance. An increase in the number of leases in which we are responsible for some or all of these expenses could negatively influence our operating results. Additionally, we seek to use master lease structures where it fits market practice in the particular property type, pursuant to which we seek to lease multiple properties to a single tenant on an all or none basis. Master leases strengthen our ability to preserve rental revenue and prevent costs associated with vacancies for underperforming properties. We believe the master lease structure is most prevalent and applicable to leases in our restaurant and retail property types, while less relevant to our other property types, such as healthcare and industrial. As of December 31, 2019, master leases contributed approximately 36.0% of our overall ABR (our largest master lease by ABR related to 24 properties and contributed 2.5% of our ABR, and our smallest master lease by ABR related to two properties and contributed 0.1% of our ABR), 74.1% of our restaurant property ABR (166 of our 249 restaurant properties), and 67.2% of our retail property ABR (85 of our 129 properties).\nInterest Expense\nWe anticipate that we will continue to incur debt in the future in order to fund future acquisition activity, which will increase the amount of interest expense we incur. In addition, although we attempt to limit our total floating-rate debt exposure, changes in the interest rate environment could either increase or decrease our weighted average interest rate in the future. Any changes to our debt structure or debt financing associated with property acquisitions, could materially influence our operating results depending on the terms of any such debt.\nProperty Management and Asset Management Fees\nFollowing completion of the Internalization, in February 2020, we will no longer pay property management and asset management fees, which had historically increased in correlation to the size of our portfolio.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nFollowing completion of the Internalization, our general and administrative expenses will include direct employee compensation costs for our 71 employees. In addition, our general and administrative expenses include certain professional fees, consulting, portfolio servicing costs, and other general and administrative expenses not previously incurred based upon our externally managed structure. Given our current team and structure, we expect that as our portfolio grows, we will experience limited increases in general and administrative expenses in the next few years after 2020, as those expenses are expected to grow at a significantly slower rate than the overall portfolio and corresponding lease revenues.\nImpact of Inflation\nOur rental revenues may be impacted by inflation. Many of our leases contain rent escalators that increase rent at a fixed amount and may not be sufficient during periods of high inflation. Leases that contributed approximately 15.9% of our ABR as of December 31, 2019, contained rent escalators based on increases in CPI and the associated increases in rental revenue may be limited during periods of low inflation. The impact of inflation on our property and operating expenses is limited since substantially all of our leases are net leases, and property-level expenses are generally paid by our tenants. To the extent we bear the cost of such expense, we attempt to limit our exposure to inflation through the use of warranties and other remedies that reduce the likelihood of a significant capital outlay. Inflation and increased costs may also have an adverse impact to our tenants and their creditworthiness if the increase in property-level expenses is greater than their increase in revenues.\nTenant Bankruptcies\nAdverse economic conditions, particularly those that affect the markets in which our properties are located, or downturns in our tenants' industries could impair our tenants' ability to meet their lease obligations to us and our ability to renew expiring leases or re-lease space. In particular, the bankruptcy of one or more of our tenants could adversely affect our ability to collect rents from such tenant and maintain our portfolio's occupancy. We have historically experienced only a limited number of tenant bankruptcies, which have not been material to our historical results.\nResults of Operations\nOur historical results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, discussed below, include the payment of asset and property management fees that we will no longer pay following the Internalization, and do not include the expected direct compensation expense associated with 71 employees employed by us following the Internalization or incremental general and administrative expenses.\nDiscussion of our Results of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 was previously filed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d under the heading Results of Operations-Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017.\u201d\nOverview\nAs of December 31, 2019, our real estate investment portfolio had a net book value of $3.5 billion, consisting of investments in 645 commercial real estate properties with locations in 41 states and one real estate property located in British Columbia, Canada, and leased to tenants in various industries. All but four of our properties were subject to a lease as of December 31, 2019, and substantially all of our leasing activity related to our real estate acquisitions.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\nLease revenues\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase/(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual rental amounts billed for operating leases\nand straight-line rent adjustments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 279,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 222,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 57,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage rent income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >100\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustments to revenue recognized for uncollectible\nrental amounts billed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (441\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (441\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (>100\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses billed to/reimbursed from tenants\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income from real estate transactions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >100\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total lease revenues from operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 294,797\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 233,538\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 61,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Earned income from direct financing leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total lease revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 298,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 237,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 61,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in lease revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily attributable to the growth in our real estate portfolio, which was achieved through rent escalations associated with our same property portfolio, coupled with rental revenue generated from accretive property acquisitions and continued strong portfolio operating performance. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we acquired 74 new properties for $1.0 billion, excluding capitalized acquisition costs. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we experienced greater than 99% rent collection and occupancy (based on rentable square footage). As of December 31, 2019, the ABR weighted average annual rent increases on our portfolio was 2.1%.\nOperating Expenses\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase/(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 108,818\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 83,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,824\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asset management fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,690\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Property management fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,529\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Property and operating expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,990\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,833\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (706\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11.5\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for impairment of investment in\nrental properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 67.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 163,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 128,076\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 35,759\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDepreciation and amortization\nThe increase in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily due to the growth in our real estate portfolio, as discussed above.\nAsset management fees\nWe paid our third-party manager a quarterly fee equal to 0.25% of the aggregate value of our equity on a fully diluted basis, based on the Determined Share Value. The increase in asset management fees during 2019, was primarily the result of an increase in our total outstanding equity on a fully diluted basis, which resulted from continued equity capital investments. As of December 31, 2019, there were 27.7 million shares of our common stock and OP Units outstanding, compared to 23.8 million as of December 31, 2018. The increase in equity capital was used to partially fund the continued growth in our real estate portfolio.\nProperty management fees\nWe paid our third-party manager a monthly fee equal to 3% of gross rentals collected from our real estate portfolio as compensation for its property management services. The increase in property management fees during the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily the result of growth in our portfolio as a result of additional property acquisitions and rent escalations.\nProperty and operating expense\nThe increase in property and operating expense was mainly attributable to the number of properties we own for which we are responsible for engaging a third-party manager to manage ongoing property maintenance, along with insurance and real estate taxes associated with those properties. We pay a majority of these expenses and are reimbursed by the tenants under the terms of the respective leases. There was a corresponding increase in operating expenses billed to tenants and included within Lease revenues.\nGeneral and administrative\nThe decrease in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019, was mainly attributable to a decrease in bad debt expense, which was approximately $1.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. As discussed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, prior to the adoption of ASC 842, provisions for doubtful accounts were recorded as bad debt expense and included in General and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Subsequent to the adoption of ASC 842 on January 1, 2019, provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded as an offset to Lease revenues, and totaled $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. As a result of the completion of the Internalization, our general and administrative expenses will include in the future direct employee compensation costs for 71 employees. In addition, our general and administrative expenses will include certain professional fees, consulting, portfolio servicing costs, and other general and administrative expenses not incurred under our previous externally managed structure. Given our current team and structure, we expect that as our portfolio grows, we will experience limited increases in general and administrative expenses in the next few years after 2020, as those expenses are expected to grow at a significantly slower rate than the overall portfolio and corresponding lease revenues.\nProvision for impairment of investment in rental properties\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized $3.5 million of impairment on our investments in rental properties. We review long-lived assets to be held and used for possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If and when such events or changes in circumstances are present, an impairment exists to the extent the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition. The impairments recognized during the year ended December 31, 2019, related to four properties whose carrying amounts we determined were not recoverable. In determining the fair value of the assets at the time of measurement, and depending on the specific property being evaluated, we utilized a capitalization rate of 14.6%, a weighted average discount rate of 8%, and a weighted average price per square foot of $226. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized $2.1 million of impairment on our investments in rental properties. The impairment related to five properties whose carrying amounts we determined were not recoverable. In determining the fair value of the assets at the time of measurement, and depending on the specific property being evaluated, we utilized capitalization rates ranging from 7.5% to 10%, and a weighted average discount rate of 8%.\nOther income (expenses)\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase/(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expenses)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Preferred distribution income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (440\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100.0\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (170\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (95.0\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (72,534\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (52,855\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,679\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (37.2\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of debt extinguishment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,176\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (101\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sale of real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,415\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (857\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,558\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sale of investment in related party\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,500\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100.0\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Internalization expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,658\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,658\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (94\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 94.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense\nThe increased interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2019, resulted primarily from an increase in average outstanding borrowings as compared to 2018, due primarily to the incurrence of indebtedness associated with the Industrial Portfolio Acquisition, partially offset by a 27 basis point decrease in our weighted average cost of debt, inclusive of our interest rate swaps. We were able to take advantage of the decreasing interest rates during the year, as our percentage of floating-rate debt increased concurrently with our funding of the Industrial Portfolio Acquisition. We also amended our 2024 Unsecured Term Loan in July 2019, to reduce the applicable margin from 1.90% to 1.25%.\nGain on sale of real estate\nOur recognition of a gain or loss on the sale of real estate varies from transaction to transaction based on fluctuations in asset prices and demand in the real estate market. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized gains of $29.9 million on the sale of 49 properties, compared to gains of $10.5 million on the sale of 20 properties during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nIncome taxes\nThe increase in income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2019, was mainly attributable to the U.S. federal and state taxes recognized on the gain on sale of certain properties held in our taxable REIT subsidiary during the fourth quarter of 2019, with no comparable activity during 2018.\nGain on sale of investment in related party\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold our investment of 100 non-voting convertible preferred units of BRE, a related party at such time, to Trident BRE LLC, another related party to BRE, for an aggregate sales price of $18.5 million. The preferred units had a carrying value of $10 million at the time of sale, resulting in a gain of $8.5 million. Prior to the sale, we received preferred distribution income on the preferred units.\nInternalization expenses\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred $3.7 million of third-party fees and consulting expenses associated with the Internalization.\nNet Income and Non-GAAP Measures (FFO and AFFO)\nOur reported results and net earnings per diluted share are presented in accordance with GAAP. We also disclose FFO and AFFO, each of which are non-GAAP measures. We believe the presentation of FFO and AFFO are useful to investors because they are widely accepted industry measures used by analysts and investors to compare the operating performance of REITs. FFO and AFFO should not be considered alternatives to net income as a performance measure or to cash flows from operations, as reported on our statement of cash flows, or as a liquidity measure, and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures.\nWe compute FFO in accordance with the standards established by the Board of Governors of Nareit, the worldwide representative voice for REITs and publicly traded real estate companies with an interest in the U.S. real estate and capital markets. Nareit defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude net gains (losses) from sales of certain depreciated real estate assets, depreciation and amortization expense from real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control, and impairment charges related to certain previously depreciated real estate assets. To derive AFFO, we modify the Nareit computation of FFO to include other adjustments to GAAP net income related to certain non-cash and non-recurring revenues and expenses, including straight-line rents, cost of debt extinguishments, amortization of lease intangibles, amortization of debt issuance costs, amortization of net mortgage premiums, (gain) loss on interest rate swaps and other non-cash interest expense, realized gains or losses on foreign currency transactions, internalization expenses, extraordinary items, and other specified non-cash items. We believe that such items are not a result of normal operations and thus we believe excluding such items assists management and investors in distinguishing whether changes in our operations are due to growth or decline of operations at our properties or from other factors.\nOur leases include cash rents that increase over the term of the lease to compensate us for anticipated increases in market rentals over time. Our leases do not include significant front-loading or back-loading of payments, or significant rent-free periods. Therefore, we find it useful to evaluate rent on a contractual basis as it allows for comparison of existing rental rates to market rental rates. We further exclude costs or gains recorded on the extinguishment of debt, non-cash interest expense and gains, the amortization of debt issuance costs, net mortgage premiums, and lease intangibles, realized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, and internalization expenses, as these items are not indicative of ongoing operational results. We use AFFO as a measure of our performance when we formulate corporate goals.\nFFO is used by management, investors, and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers, primarily because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions. We believe that AFFO is a useful supplemental measure for investors to consider because it will help them to better assess our operating performance without the distortions created by non-cash revenues or expenses. FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other REITs, and comparisons of our FFO and AFFO with the same or similar measures disclosed by other REITs may not be meaningful.\nNeither the SEC nor any other regulatory body has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments to FFO that we use to calculate AFFO. In the future, the SEC, Nareit or another regulatory body may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the REIT industry and in response to such standardization we may have to adjust our calculation and characterization of AFFO accordingly.\nThe following table presents our net income and our non-GAAP FFO and AFFO. Our measures of FFO and AFFO are computed on the basis of amounts attributable to both us and non-controlling interests. As the non-\ncontrolling interests share in our net income on a one-for-one basis, the basic and diluted per-share amounts are the same.\nTable 137: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase/(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands, except per share data)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 85,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 75,105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net earnings per diluted share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.12\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3.5\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FFO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 167,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 150,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,806\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FFO per diluted share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.51\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.88\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.37\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5.4\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AFFO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 149,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 124,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AFFO per diluted share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5.80\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5.66\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted WASO(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,910\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,806\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Weighted average number of shares of our common stock and OP Units outstanding ( WASO\u201d), computed in accordance with GAAP.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, growth in net income was primarily attributable to revenue growth, as discussed in Results of Operations - Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018, combined with a $19.4 million increase in gains on sale of real estate. These factors were partially offset by a $24.8 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense associated with a larger real estate portfolio, a $19.7 million increase in interest expense associated with incremental borrowings used to partially fund our real estate acquisitions, and $3.7 million in internalization expenses incurred in 2019. We also recognized an $8.5 million gain on the sale of an investment in a related party during 2018, with no such activity in 2019.\nGAAP net income includes items such as gain or loss on sale of real estate and provisions for impairment, among others, which can vary from quarter to quarter and impact period-to-period comparisons. These fluctuations, coupled with our ongoing equity offering, resulted in a $0.12 decrease in net earnings per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nAFFO\nThe increase in AFFO during the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, was primarily driven by revenue growth in our real estate portfolio. This resulted from rent escalations associated with our same property portfolio, accretive acquisitions and strong portfolio operating performance.\nThe $0.14 increase in AFFO per diluted share was primarily the result of accretive acquisitions during the year, coupled with the positive per share impact of funding a larger portion of our acquisitions with lower costing debt compared to equity. We are committed to maintaining an investment grade balance sheet through active management of our leverage profile and overall liquidity position.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\nThe following is a reconciliation of net income to FFO and AFFO, which are non-GAAP financial measures.

Our focus is on maximizing the risk-adjusted return to our stockholders through an appropriate balance of debt and equity in our capital structure. We are committed to maintaining an investment grade balance sheet through active management of our leverage profile and overall liquidity position. We believe our leverage model has allowed us to take advantage of the lower cost of debt while simultaneously strengthening our balance sheet, as evidenced by our investment grade credit rating. As of December 31, 2019, our leverage ratio was 45.8% of the approximate market value of our assets, compared to 41.5% as of December 31, 2018. The increase was due to incremental borrowings associated with funding the Industrial Portfolio Acquisition during the third quarter of 2019. Following the Industrial Portfolio Acquisition, we have reduced our leverage profile using a combination of proceeds from our private offering of shares of our common stock and increasing disposition activity. As a result of our announcing the Industrial Portfolio Acquisition, Moody's affirmed our investment grade credit rating and stable outlook.\nLiquidity/REIT Requirements\nLiquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including our ongoing commitments to repay debt, fund our operations, acquire properties, make distributions to our stockholders, and other general business needs. As a REIT, we are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain, on an annual basis. As a result, it is unlikely that we will be able to retain substantial cash balances to meet our liquidity needs from our annual taxable income. Instead, we expect to meet our liquidity needs primarily by relying upon external sources of capital.\nShort-term Liquidity Requirements\nOur short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for our operating expenses, including our general and administrative expenses as well as interest payments on our outstanding debt and to pay distributions. Since our portfolio has a strong occupancy level and substantially all of our leases are net leases, we do not currently anticipate making significant capital expenditures or incurring other significant property costs. We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements primarily from cash and cash equivalents balances, net cash provided by operating activities, and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.\nLong-term Liquidity Requirements\nOur long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to repay debt and invest in additional revenue generating properties. Debt capital is provided through unsecured term notes, revolving debt facilities, and senior unsecured notes.\nThe source and mix of our debt capital in the future will be impacted by market conditions as well as our continued focus on lengthening our debt maturity profile to better align with our portfolio's lease terms, staggering debt maturities to reduce the risk that a significant amount of debt will mature in any single year in the future, and managing our exposure to interest rate risk.\nWe expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements primarily from borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility, future debt and equity financings, and proceeds from limited sales of our properties. Our ability to access these capital sources may be impacted by unfavorable market conditions, particularly in the debt and equity capital markets, that are outside of our control. In addition, our success will depend on our operating performance, our borrowing restrictions, our degree of leverage, and other factors. Our acquisition growth strategy significantly depends on our ability to obtain acquisition financing on favorable terms. We seek to reduce the risk that long-term debt capital may be unavailable to us by strengthening our balance sheet by investing in real estate with creditworthy tenants and lease guarantors, and by maintaining an appropriate mix of debt and equity capitalization. We also, from time to time, obtain or assume non-recourse mortgage financing from banks and insurance companies secured by mortgages on the corresponding specific property. Mortgages, however, are not currently a strategic focus of the active management of our leverage profile. Rather, we enter into mortgages and notes payable as ancillary business transactions on an as-needed basis, most often as the result of lease assumption transactions.\nEquity Capital Resources\nEquity capital for our real estate acquisition activity has historically been provided from the proceeds of our private offering, including distributions reinvested through our DRIP. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we raised $394.4 million in equity capital to be used in our acquisition activities, of which $329.8 million was received through new cash investments and $64.6 million was raised through our DRIP. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we raised $283.7 million in equity capital, of which $215.7 million was received through new cash investments, $52.2 million was raised through our DRIP, and $15.8 million was raised in exchange for OP Units through UPREIT transactions.\nCredit Rating\nWe achieved our current investment grade credit rating of Baa3 based on our conservative leverage profile, diversified real estate investment portfolio, access to capital, and earnings stability provided by the creditworthiness of our tenants. Factors that could negatively impact our credit rating include, but are not limited to: a significant increase in our leverage on a sustained basis, a significant increase in the proportion of secured debt levels, a significant decline in our unencumbered asset base, weakening of our corporate governance structure, and a significant decline in our real estate portfolio diversification or the creditworthiness of our tenants. Factors that could positively impact our credit rating include, but are not limited to, continued growth in the portfolio, improvement in our leverage profile, lengthening of our debt maturity profile, and our Internalization. We have aligned our strategic growth priorities with these factors, as we believe the favorable debt pricing and access to multiple sources of debt capital resulting from our investment grade credit rating provides us with an advantageous cost of capital and risk-adjusted return on investment for our stockholders.\nRecent Activity\nOn February 7, 2020, we entered into a $60 million term loan agreement maturing February 28, 2022 (the 2022 Unsecured Term Loan\u201d) with JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent. The 2022 Unsecured Term Loan was fully funded at closing and used to partially repay BRE debt that had been assumed by the Company as part of the Internalization. Borrowings under the 2022 Unsecured Term Loan are subject to interest only payments at variable rates equal to LIBOR plus a margin based on our credit rating, ranging between 0.85% and 1.65% per annum. Based on our current credit rating, the applicable margin is 1.25%.\nExisting Credit Facilities\nThe following table sets forth our outstanding Revolving Credit Facility, unsecured term loans and Senior Notes as of December 31, 2019.\nTable 140: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Maturity\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands, except interest rates)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Date\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2020 Unsecured Term Loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> one-month LIBOR + 1.25%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Aug. 2020\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credit Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revolving Credit Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 197,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> one-month LIBOR + 1.20%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Jan. 2022\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2023 Unsecured Term Loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 265,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> one-month LIBOR + 1.35%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Jan. 2023\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2024 Unsecured Term Loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 190,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> one-month LIBOR + 1.25%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Jun. 2024\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 652,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2026 Unsecured Term Loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 450,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> one-month LIBOR + 1.85%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Feb. 2026\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Series A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 150,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.84%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Apr. 2027\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Series B\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 225,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.09%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Jul. 2028\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Series C\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.19%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Jul. 2030\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 475,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,877,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevolving Credit Facility\nThe Revolving Credit Facility has a maximum availability of $600 million, and includes a $35 million sublimit for swingline loans and $20 million available for issuance of letters of credit.

Borrowings under the 2024 Unsecured Term Loan are subject to interest at variable rates based on LIBOR plus a margin based on our credit rating ranging between 0.85% and 1.65% per annum. Based on our current credit rating, the applicable margin is 1.25% as of December 31, 2019.\n2026 Unsecured Term Loan\nThe 2026 Unsecured Term Loan includes an accordion feature that provides for an increase in the facility size up to a total of $550 million of available capacity. Borrowings under the 2026 Unsecured Term Loan are payable interest only on a monthly basis during the term of the loan, with the principal amount due in February 2026. Borrowings under the 2026 Unsecured Term loan bear interest equal to LIBOR plus a margin based on our credit rating ranging between 1.45% and 2.40% per annum. Based on our current grade credit rating, the applicable margin is 1.85% as of December 31, 2019.\nSenior Notes\nTo mitigate interest rate risk, we have strategically added unsecured, fixed-rate, interest-only senior promissory notes ( Senior Notes\u201d) to our capital structure. The Senior Notes were issued in three series (Series A, B, and C) as described below.\nSeries A Notes\nThe Series A Notes are payable interest only semiannually during their term, bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.84% per annum, and mature on April 18, 2027.\nSeries B and Series C Notes\nThe Series B Notes mature on July 2, 2028, and the Series C Notes mature on July 2, 2030. The Series B and Series C Notes are payable interest only semiannually during their term, and bear interest at fixed rates of 5.09% per annum and 5.19% per annum, respectively.\nDebt Covenants\nWe are subject to various covenants and financial reporting requirements pursuant to our debt facilities. The table below summarizes the applicable financial covenants, which are substantially the same across each of our debt facilities. As of December 31, 2019, we believe that we were in compliance with all of our covenants. In the event of default, either through default on payments or breach of covenants, we may be restricted from paying dividends to our stockholders in excess of dividends required to maintain our REIT qualification. For each of the previous three years, we paid dividends out of our cash flows from operations in excess of the distribution amounts required to maintain our REIT qualification.\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td> Covenants\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Required\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Actual\n(as of\nDecember 31,\n2019)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Leverage Ratio(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2264 0.60 to 1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.50\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Secured Indebtedness Ratio(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2264 0.40 to 1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.03\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unencumbered Coverage Ratio(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2265 1.75 to 1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.50\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2265 1.50 to 1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.85\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Unsecured Indebtedness to Total\nUnencumbered Eligible Property Value(5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2264 0.60 to 1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.53\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dividends and Other Restricted Payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Only applicable\nin case of default\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Not\nApplicable\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> The leverage ratio is calculated as the ratio of total indebtedness to total market value.

Borrowings pursuant to our unsecured credit facilities and the mortgage bear interest at floating rates based on LIBOR plus an applicable margin. Accordingly, fluctuations in market interest rates may increase or decrease our interest expense, which will in turn, increase or decrease our net income and cash flow.\nWe attempt to manage our interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swaps. As of December 31, 2019, we had 34 interest rate swaps outstanding in an aggregate notional amount of $909.9 million. Under these agreements, we receive monthly payments from the counterparties equal to the related variable interest rates multiplied by the outstanding notional amounts. In turn, we pay the counterparties each month an amount equal to a fixed interest rate multiplied by the related outstanding notional amounts. The intended net impact of these transactions is that we pay a fixed interest rate on our variable-rate borrowings. The interest rate swaps have been designated by us as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes and are reported at fair value. We assess, both at inception and on an ongoing basis, the effectiveness of our qualifying cash flow hedges. We have not entered, and do not intend to enter, into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes.\nCash Flows\nCash and cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled $20.3 million, $19.0 million, and $10.1 million at December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The table below shows information concerning cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017:\nTable 147: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the years ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 147,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 128,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 97,940\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (831,707\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (510,459\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (611,835\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 685,671\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 391,338\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 500,891\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents and restricted\ncash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,890\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (13,004\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in net cash provided by operating activities during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, as compared to the comparable prior periods, was mainly due to growth in our real estate portfolio.\nThe increase in net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, reflected increased outflows for the acquisition of properties, most notably the Industrial Portfolio Acquisition. In addition, during the 2018 period, we received $18.5 million from the sale of our investment in preferred units of BRE, with no such cash inflow in 2019. These factors were somewhat offset by increased proceeds from the disposal of properties as we actively manage our balance sheet following the Industrial Portfolio Acquisition. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, mainly reflected lower outflows for the acquisition of properties, combined with the cash received on the sale of the preferred units of BRE.\nThe increase in net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, mainly reflects net incremental borrowings and increased proceeds from the issuance of our common stock, which were used to fund the increased acquisition activity, partially offset by increased distributions resulting from an increase in the number of shares of common stock outstanding. The decrease in net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, mainly reflected lower net borrowings due to lower acquisition volume, combined with lower proceeds from the sale of common stock reflective of the equity cap and queue program that we instituted in November 2017 to better match fund inflows from equity investments with outflows for acquisitions.\nImpact of Inflation\nThe leases in our portfolio are long-term in nature, with a current ABR weighted average remaining lease term of 11.5 years as of December 31, 2019. Our rental revenues may be impacted by inflation. Substantially all of our leases have contractual lease escalations, with an ABR weighted average of 2.1% as of December 31, 2019. Many of our leases contain rent escalators that increase rent at a fixed amount and may not be sufficient during periods of high inflation. Leases that contributed approximately 15.9% of our ABR as of December 31, 2019, contained rent escalators based on increases in CPI and the associated increases in rental revenue may be limited during periods of low inflation. The impact of inflation on our property and operating expenses is limited since substantially all of our leases are net leases, and property-level expenses are generally paid by our tenants. To the extent we bear the cost of such expense, we attempt to limit our exposure to inflation through the use of warranties and other remedies that reduce the likelihood of a significant capital outlay. Inflation and increased costs may also have an adverse impact to our tenants and their creditworthiness if the increase in property-level expenses is greater than their increase in revenues.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2019, or December 31, 2018.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table provides information with respect to our contractual commitments and obligations as of December 31, 2019 (in thousands).\nTable 148: <table> <tr> <td> Year of\nMaturity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Term Loan\nAgreements(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Revolving Credit Facility(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Senior\nNotes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Mortgages\nand Notes\nPayable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Interest\nExpense(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Tenant\nImprovement\nAllowances(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Operating\nLeases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,210\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 74,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 380,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,028\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 68,961\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 87,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 197,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 61,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 261,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 265,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 52,708\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 326,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 190,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 240,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 450,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 475,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 77,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 116,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,411\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,121,355\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,205,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 197,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 475,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 112,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 422,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,992\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,418,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 149: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> We may extend the 2020 Unsecured Term Loan twice, each time for a six-month period, subject to certain conditions, including the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.05% of the aggregate principal amount of loans outstanding.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 150: <table> <tr> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> We may extend the Revolving Credit Facility once, for a five-month period, subject to certain conditions, including the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.0625% of the revolving commitments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 151: <table> <tr> <td> (3)\n</td> <td> Interest expense is projected based on the outstanding borrowings and interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2019.

The tax protection agreements require us to indemnify the beneficiaries in the event of a sale, exchange, transfer, or other disposal of the contributed property, or in the case of the Founding Owners' Tax Protection Agreement, the entire Company, in a taxable transaction that would cause such beneficiaries to recognize a gain that is protected under the agreements, subject to certain exceptions. Based on values as of December 31, 2019, taxable sales would trigger liability under the four tax protection agreements of approximately $22.3 million. Based on information available, we do not believe that the events resulting in damages as detailed above have occurred or are likely to occur in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, we have excluded these commitments from the contractual commitments table above.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses as well as other disclosures in the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and assumptions; however, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions, which in turn could have a material impact on our financial statements. A summary of our significant accounting policies and procedures are included in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d, contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nInvestments in Rental Property\nWe record investments in rental property accounted for under operating leases at cost. We record investments in rental property accounted for under direct financing leases at their net investment (which at the inception of the lease generally represents the cost of the property).\nWe early adopted ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business ( ASU 2017-01\u201d), on a prospective basis, effective January 1, 2017. The guidance changes the definition of a business to exclude acquisitions where substantially all of the fair value of the assets acquired are concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets, and therefore are accounted for as asset acquisitions instead of business combinations. All of our acquisitions of real estate closed subsequent to adopting ASU 2017-01 are accounted for as asset acquisitions.\nWe allocate the purchase price of investments in rental property accounted for as asset acquisitions based on the relative fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. These generally include tangible assets, consisting of land and land improvements, buildings and other improvements, and equipment, and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities, including the value of in-place leases and acquired above-market and below-market leases. Acquisition costs incurred in connection with investments in real estate accounted for as asset acquisitions are capitalized and included with the allocated purchase price. The results of operations of acquired properties are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income from the respective date of acquisition.\nWe allocate the purchase price of investments in rental property accounted for as a business combination based on the estimated fair value at the date of the acquisition of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. These generally include tangible assets, consisting of land and land improvements, buildings and other improvements, and equipment, and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities, including the value of in-place leases and acquired above-market and below-market leases. Acquisition costs incurred in connection with investments in real estate accounted for as business combinations are expensed at the time of acquisition. The results of operations of acquired properties are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income from the respective date of acquisition.\nWe use multiple sources to estimate fair value, including information obtained about each property as a result of our pre-acquisition due diligence and our marketing and leasing activities. Factors that impact our fair value determination include real estate market conditions, industry conditions that the tenant operates in, and characteristics of the real estate and/or real estate appraisals. Changes in any of these factors could impact the future purchase prices of our investments and the corresponding capitalization rates recognized. We do not believe the assumptions used to fair value the investments upon acquisition have a significant degree of estimation uncertainty.\nWe determine the fair value of tangible assets of an acquired property by valuing the property as if it were vacant. Management then allocates the as-if-vacant value to land and land improvements, buildings, and equipment based on comparable sales and other relevant information with respect to the property, as estimated by management. Specifically, the if vacant\u201d value of buildings and equipment is calculated using an income approach. Assumptions used in the income approach to value buildings include: capitalization and discount rates, lease-up time, market rents, make ready costs, land value, and land improvement value.\nThe estimated fair value of acquired in-place leases equals the costs we would have had to incur to lease the properties to the occupancy level of the properties at the date of acquisition. Such costs include the fair value of leasing commissions and other operating costs that would have been incurred to lease the properties, had they been vacant, to their acquired occupancy level. We amortize acquired in-place leases as of the date of acquisition over the remaining initial non-cancellable terms of the respective leases to amortization expense.\nWe record acquired above-market and below-market lease values based on the present value (using an interest rate that reflects the risks associated with the lease acquired) of the differences between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and management's estimate of fair market value lease rates at the time of acquisition for the corresponding in-place leases. We amortize the capitalized above-market and below-market lease values as adjustments to rental revenue over the remaining term of the respective leases.\nShould a tenant terminate its lease, we charge the unamortized portion of the in-place lease value to amortization expense and we charge the unamortized portion of above-market or below-market lease value to rental income.\nManagement estimates the fair value of assumed mortgages and notes payable based upon indications of then-current market pricing for similar types of debt with similar maturities. We record assumed mortgages and notes payable at their estimated fair value as of the assumption date, and the difference between the estimated fair value and the notes' outstanding principal balance is amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the debt.\nLong-lived Asset Impairment\nWe review long-lived assets to be held and used for possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If, and when, such events or changes in circumstances are present, an impairment exists to the extent the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition. Such cash flows include expected future operating income, as adjusted for trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition, and other factors. An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group. A significant judgment is made as to if and when impairment should be taken. If our strategy, or one or more of the assumptions described above were to change in the future, an impairment may need to be recognized.\nInputs used in establishing fair value for real estate assets generally fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, which are characterized as requiring significant judgment as little or no current market activity may be available for validation. The main indicator used to establish the classification of the inputs is current market conditions, as derived through our use of published commercial real estate market information. We determine the valuation of impaired assets using generally accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis, income capitalization, analysis of recent comparable sales transactions, actual sales negotiations, and bona fide purchase offers received from third parties. We may consider a single valuation technique or multiple valuation techniques, as appropriate, when estimating the fair value of real estate.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, we recorded impairment charges of $3.5 million, $2.1 million, and $2.6 million, respectively. Impairment indicators were identified due to concerns over each tenant's future viability, property vacancies, and changes to the overall investment strategy for the real estate assets. In determining the fair value of the real estate assets at the time of measurement, and depending on the property being evaluated, we utilized capitalization rates ranging from 7.25% to 12.0%, a weighted average discount rate of 8.0%, and a weighted average price per square foot of $226, which are Level 3 inputs. We believe the uncertainty in the future cash flows was reflected in the significant capitalization rate, and the estimates were based on the information available at the time of impairment. The properties for which an impairment charge was recorded in 2018 were subsequently sold in 2019. One of the properties for which an impairment charge was recorded in 2017 was subsequently sold in 2018. The assumptions we used in determining the amount of the impairment charges on these properties were validated upon the subsequent sales, which were at values consistent with our originally estimated impaired values. We classified the impairment charge within earnings from operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company commences revenue recognition on its leases based on a number of factors, including the initial determination that the contract is or contains a lease. Generally, all of the Company's property related contracts are or contain leases, and therefore revenue is recognized when the lessee takes possession of or controls the physical use of the leased assets. In most instances this occurs on the lease commencement date. At the time of lease assumption or at the inception of a new lease, including new leases that arise from amendments, the Company assesses the terms and conditions of the lease to determine the proper lease classification.\nCertain of the Company's leases require tenants to pay rent based upon a percentage of the property's net sales ( percentage rent\u201d) or contain rent escalators indexed to future changes in the CPI. Lease income associated with such provisions is considered variable lease income and therefore is not included in the initial measurement of the lease receivable, or in the calculation of straight-line rent revenue. Such amounts are recognized as income when the amounts are determinable.\nAs described in Recently Adopted Accounting Standards in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) and related ASUs subsequently issued (collectively, ASC 842\u201d) as of January 1, 2019.\nLeases Executed on or After Adoption of ASC 842\nA lease is classified as an operating lease if none of the following criteria are met: (i) ownership transfers to the lessee at the end of the lease term, (ii) the lessee has a purchase option that is reasonably expected to be exercised, (iii) the lease term is for a major part of the economic life of the leased property, (iv) the present value of the future lease payments and any residual value guaranteed by the lessee that is not already reflected in the lease payments equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the leased property, and (v) the leased property is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no future alternative use to the Company at the end of the lease term. If one or more of these criteria are met, the lease will generally be classified as a sales-type lease, unless the lease contains a residual value guarantee from a third party other than the lessee, in which case it would be classified as a direct financing lease under certain circumstances in accordance with ASC 842.\nASC 842 requires the Company to account for the right to use land as a separate lease component, unless the accounting effect of doing so would be insignificant. Determination of significance requires management judgment. In determining whether the accounting effect of separately reporting the land component from other components for its real estate leases is significant, the Company assesses: (i) whether separating the land component impacts the classification of any lease component, (ii) the value of the land component in the context of the overall contract, and (iii) whether the right to use the land is coterminous with the rights to use the other assets.\nLeases Executed Prior to Adoption of ASC 842\nA lease arrangement was classified as an operating lease if none of the following criteria were met: (i) ownership transferred to the lessee prior to or shortly after the end of the lease term, (ii) the lessee had a bargain purchase option during or at the end of the lease term, (iii) the lease term was greater than or equal to 75% of the underlying property's estimated useful life, or (iv) the present value of the future minimum lease payments (excluding executory costs) was greater than or equal to 90% of the fair value of the leased property. If one or more of these criteria were met, and the minimum lease payments were determined to be reasonably predictable and collectible, the lease arrangement was generally accounted for as a direct financing lease. Consistent with ASC 840, Leases, if the fair value of the land component was 25% or more of the total fair value of the leased property, the land was considered separately from the building for purposes of applying the lease term and minimum lease payments criterion in (iii) and (iv) above.\nRevenue recognition methods for operating leases, direct financing leases, and sales-type leases are described below:\nRental property accounted for under operating leases - Revenue is recognized as rents are earned on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable terms of the related leases. For leases that have fixed and measurable rent escalations, the difference between such rental income earned and the cash rent due under the provisions of the lease is recorded as Accrued rental income on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nRental property accounted for under direct financing leases - The Company utilizes the direct finance method of accounting to record direct financing lease income. The net investment in the direct financing lease represents receivables for the sum of future lease payments to be received and the estimated residual value of the leased property, less unamortized unearned income (which represents the difference between undiscounted cash flows and discounted cash flows). Unearned income is deferred and amortized into income over the lease terms so as to produce a constant periodic rate of return on the Company's net investment in the leases.\nRental property accounted for under sales-type leases - For leases accounted for as sales-type leases, the Company records selling profit arising from the lease at inception, along with the net investment in the lease. The Company leases assets through the assumption of existing leases or through sale-leaseback transactions, and records such assets at their fair value at the time of acquisition, which in most cases coincides with lease inception. As a result, the Company does not generally recognize selling profit on sales-type leases. The net investment in the sales-type lease represents receivables for the sum of future lease payments and the estimated unguaranteed residual value of the leased property, each measured at net present value. Interest income is recorded over the lease terms so as to produce a constant periodic rate of return on the Company's net investment in the leases.\nCertain of the Company's contracts contain nonlease components (e.g., charges for management fees, common area maintenance, and reimbursement of third-party maintenance expenses) in addition to lease components (i.e., monthly rental charges). Services related to nonlease components are provided over the same period of time as, and billed in the same manner as, monthly rental charges. The Company elected to apply the practical expedient available under ASC 842, for all classes of assets, not to separate the lease components from the nonlease components when accounting for operating leases. Since the lease component is the predominant component under each of these leases, combined revenues from both the lease and nonlease components are reported as Lease revenues in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\nManagement uses interest rate swap agreements to manage risks related to interest rate movements on our variable-rate debt. The interest rate swap agreements, designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges, are reported at fair value. We adopted ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting and Hedging Activities, effective January 1, 2018 on a modified retrospective basis. ASU 2017-12 amended the designation and measurement guidance for qualifying hedging transactions and the presentation of hedge results in an entity's financial statements.\nPrior to the adoption of ASU 2017-12, the gain or loss on the effective portion of the hedge was initially included as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and was subsequently reclassified into earnings when interest payments on the related debt were incurred and as the swap net settlements occurred. If and when there was ineffectiveness realized on a swap agreement, the Company recognized the ineffectiveness as a component of interest expense in the period incurred.\nASU 2017-12 removed the concept of separately measuring and reporting hedge ineffectiveness and requires a company to present the earnings effect of the hedging instrument in the same income statement line item in which the earnings effect of the hedged item is reported. In accordance with ASU 2017-12, the gain or loss on the qualifying hedges is initially included as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and is subsequently reclassified into earnings when interest payments (the forecasted transactions) on the related debt are incurred and as the swap net settlements occur.\nWhen an existing cash flow hedge is terminated, we determine the accounting treatment for the accumulated gain or loss recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, based on the probability of the hedged forecasted transaction occurring within the period the cash flow hedge was anticipated to affect earnings. If management determines that the hedged forecasted transaction is probable of occurring during the original period, the accumulated gain or loss is reclassified into earnings over the remaining life of the cash flow hedge using a straight-line method, which approximates an effective interest method. If management determines that the hedged forecasted transaction is not probable of occurring during the original period, the entire amount of accumulated gain or loss is reclassified into earnings in the period the cash flow hedge is terminated.\nManagement documents its risk management strategy and hedge effectiveness at the inception of and during the term of each hedge. Our interest rate risk management strategy is intended to stabilize cash flow requirements by maintaining interest rate swap agreements to convert certain variable-rate debt to a fixed rate.\nImpact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information on the impact of recent accounting pronouncements on our business, see the captions Recently Adopted Accounting Standards and Other Recently Issued Accounting Standards in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. This MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe acquire, own, and manage primarily single-tenant commercial real estate properties that are net leased on a long-term basis to a diversified group of tenants. Since our inception in 2007, we have selectively invested in net leased assets in the industrial, healthcare, restaurant, office, and retail property types, and as of December 31, 2019, our portfolio has grown to 645 properties in 41 U.S. states and one property in Canada.\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from rents received from single tenants of each of our net leased properties in our portfolio. We typically lease our properties pursuant to long-term net leases with initial terms of 10 years or more that often have renewal options. As of December 31, 2019, leases contributing approximately 98.4% of our ABR provided for periodic rent escalations, generally ranging from 1.5% to 2.5% annually, with an ABR weighted average minimum increase of 2.1%. As of December 31, 2019, our properties were occupied by approximately 186 different commercial tenants who operate 169 different brands that are diversified across 54 differing industries, with no single tenant accounting for more than 2.8% of our ABR.\nIn order to benefit from increasing economies of scale as we continue to grow, our board of directors made the decision to internalize our management structure, which was completed on February 7, 2020. In connection with the Internalization, we terminated our management agreements with BRE, entered into employment agreements with each of our named executive officers, and began directly employing 71 former employees of BRE. Our historical results of operations through December 31, 2019, include the payment of management fees that we will no longer pay following the Internalization and do not include the direct compensation expense associated with our 71 employees, or certain professional fees, consulting, portfolio servicing costs, and other general and administrative expenses not previously incurred based upon our externally managed structure. No amounts were payable to BRE under the termination provisions of the management agreements related to the Internalization.\nFactors that Affect Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nOur results of operations and financial condition are affected by numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. Key factors that impact our results of operations and financial condition include rental rates, lease renewals and occupancy, acquisition volume, net lease terms, financing arrangements and leverage, property dispositions, general and administrative expenses, inflation, and tenant bankruptcies.\nRental Rates\nOur ability to grow rental revenue from our existing portfolio will depend on our ability to realize the rental escalations built into our leases. As of December 31, 2019, leases contributing approximately 98.4% of our ABR provided for increases in future annual base rent, generally ranging from 1.5% to 2.5% annually, with an ABR weighted average minimum increase of 2.1% of base rent. Generally, our rent escalators increase rent on specified dates by a fixed percentage. Approximately 15.9% of our rent escalators are based on an increase in the CPI over a specified period and 1.6% of our leases are flat leases, meaning they do not provide for rent increases during their terms. During periods of low inflation, small increases in the CPI will result in limited increases in rental revenue from our leases that contain rent escalators based on CPI increases. However, when the CPI decreases or does not change over the relevant period, our rental revenue from such leases is not reduced and will remain the same.\nProperty Dispositions\nFrom time to time, we will strategically dispose of properties, primarily where we believe the risk profile has changed and become misaligned with our then current risk-adjusted return objectives. The resulting gains or losses on\ndispositions may materially impact our operating results. The recognition of a gain or loss on the sale of real estate varies from transaction to transaction based on fluctuations in asset prices and demand in the real estate market at the time a property is listed for sale.\nLease Renewals and Occupancy\nAs of December 31, 2019, the ABR weighted average remaining term of our leases was approximately 11.5 years, excluding renewal options. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 8.6% of our leases (based on ABR) will expire prior to January 1, 2025. See Item 1. Business, Our Leases\u201d. The stability of the rental revenue generated by our properties depends principally on our tenants' ability to pay rent and our ability to collect rents, renew expiring leases or re-lease space upon the expiration or other termination of leases, lease currently vacant properties, and maintain or increase rental rates at our leased properties. To the extent our properties become vacant, we would forego rental income while remaining responsible for the payment of property taxes and maintaining the property until it is re-leased, which could negatively impact our operating results. However, given our historically strong occupancy rates (since our inception, occupancy has generally been above 99%), we do not anticipate that such impact will be significant.\nAcquisition Volume\nOur historical growth in revenues and earnings has been achieved through rent escalations associated with existing in-place leases, coupled with rental income generated from accretive property acquisitions. Our ability to grow revenue will depend, to a significant degree, on our ability to acquire additional properties. Our ability to grow requires us to identify and complete acquisitions that meet our investment criteria. Changes in capitalization rates, interest rates, or other factors may impact our acquisition opportunities in the future. Market conditions may also impact the total returns we can achieve on our investments. Our acquisition volume also depends on our ability to access third-party debt and equity financing to fund our capital needs.\nNet Lease Terms\nSubstantially all of our leases are net leases pursuant to which our tenant generally is obligated to pay all expenses associated with the leased property including real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance, repairs, and capital costs. A limited number of leases require us to pay some or all of the property expenses such as the cost of environmental liabilities, roof and structure repairs, real estate taxes, insurance, or certain non-structural repairs and maintenance. An increase in the number of leases in which we are responsible for some or all of these expenses could negatively influence our operating results. Additionally, we seek to use master lease structures where it fits market practice in the particular property type, pursuant to which we seek to lease multiple properties to a single tenant on an all or none basis. Master leases strengthen our ability to preserve rental revenue and prevent costs associated with vacancies for underperforming properties. We believe the master lease structure is most prevalent and applicable to leases in our restaurant and retail property types, while less relevant to our other property types, such as healthcare and industrial. As of December 31, 2019, master leases contributed approximately 36.0% of our overall ABR (our largest master lease by ABR related to 24 properties and contributed 2.5% of our ABR, and our smallest master lease by ABR related to two properties and contributed 0.1% of our ABR), 74.1% of our restaurant property ABR (166 of our 249 restaurant properties), and 67.2% of our retail property ABR (85 of our 129 properties).\nInterest Expense\nWe anticipate that we will continue to incur debt in the future in order to fund future acquisition activity, which will increase the amount of interest expense we incur. In addition, although we attempt to limit our total floating-rate debt exposure, changes in the interest rate environment could either increase or decrease our weighted average interest rate in the future. Any changes to our debt structure or debt financing associated with property acquisitions, could materially influence our operating results depending on the terms of any such debt.\nProperty Management and Asset Management Fees\nFollowing completion of the Internalization, in February 2020, we will no longer pay property management and asset management fees, which had historically increased in correlation to the size of our portfolio.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nFollowing completion of the Internalization, our general and administrative expenses will include direct employee compensation costs for our 71 employees. In addition, our general and administrative expenses include certain professional fees, consulting, portfolio servicing costs, and other general and administrative expenses not previously incurred based upon our externally managed structure. Given our current team and structure, we expect that as our portfolio grows, we will experience limited increases in general and administrative expenses in the next few years after 2020, as those expenses are expected to grow at a significantly slower rate than the overall portfolio and corresponding lease revenues.\nImpact of Inflation\nOur rental revenues may be impacted by inflation. Many of our leases contain rent escalators that increase rent at a fixed amount and may not be sufficient during periods of high inflation. Leases that contributed approximately 15.9% of our ABR as of December 31, 2019, contained rent escalators based on increases in CPI and the associated increases in rental revenue may be limited during periods of low inflation. The impact of inflation on our property and operating expenses is limited since substantially all of our leases are net leases, and property-level expenses are generally paid by our tenants. To the extent we bear the cost of such expense, we attempt to limit our exposure to inflation through the use of warranties and other remedies that reduce the likelihood of a significant capital outlay. Inflation and increased costs may also have an adverse impact to our tenants and their creditworthiness if the increase in property-level expenses is greater than their increase in revenues.\nTenant Bankruptcies\nAdverse economic conditions, particularly those that affect the markets in which our properties are located, or downturns in our tenants' industries could impair our tenants' ability to meet their lease obligations to us and our ability to renew expiring leases or re-lease space. In particular, the bankruptcy of one or more of our tenants could adversely affect our ability to collect rents from such tenant and maintain our portfolio's occupancy. We have historically experienced only a limited number of tenant bankruptcies, which have not been material to our historical results.\nResults of Operations\nOur historical results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, discussed below, include the payment of asset and property management fees that we will no longer pay following the Internalization, and do not include the expected direct compensation expense associated with 71 employees employed by us following the Internalization or incremental general and administrative expenses.\nDiscussion of our Results of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 was previously filed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d under the heading Results of Operations-Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017.\u201d\nOverview\nAs of December 31, 2019, our real estate investment portfolio had a net book value of $3.5 billion, consisting of investments in 645 commercial real estate properties with locations in 41 states and one real estate property located in British Columbia, Canada, and leased to tenants in various industries. All but four of our properties were subject to a lease as of December 31, 2019, and substantially all of our leasing activity related to our real estate acquisitions.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\nLease revenues\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase/(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual rental amounts billed for operating leases\nand straight-line rent adjustments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 279,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 222,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 57,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage rent income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >100\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustments to revenue recognized for uncollectible\nrental amounts billed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (441\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (441\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (>100\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses billed to/reimbursed from tenants\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income from real estate transactions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >100\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total lease revenues from operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 294,797\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 233,538\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 61,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Earned income from direct financing leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total lease revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 298,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 237,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 61,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in lease revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily attributable to the growth in our real estate portfolio, which was achieved through rent escalations associated with our same property portfolio, coupled with rental revenue generated from accretive property acquisitions and continued strong portfolio operating performance. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we acquired 74 new properties for $1.0 billion, excluding capitalized acquisition costs. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we experienced greater than 99% rent collection and occupancy (based on rentable square footage). As of December 31, 2019, the ABR weighted average annual rent increases on our portfolio was 2.1%.\nOperating Expenses\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase/(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 108,818\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 83,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,824\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asset management fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,690\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Property management fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,529\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Property and operating expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,990\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,833\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (706\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11.5\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for impairment of investment in\nrental properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 67.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 163,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 128,076\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 35,759\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDepreciation and amortization\nThe increase in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily due to the growth in our real estate portfolio, as discussed above.\nAsset management fees\nWe paid our third-party manager a quarterly fee equal to 0.25% of the aggregate value of our equity on a fully diluted basis, based on the Determined Share Value. The increase in asset management fees during 2019, was primarily the result of an increase in our total outstanding equity on a fully diluted basis, which resulted from continued equity capital investments. As of December 31, 2019, there were 27.7 million shares of our common stock and OP Units outstanding, compared to 23.8 million as of December 31, 2018. The increase in equity capital was used to partially fund the continued growth in our real estate portfolio.\nProperty management fees\nWe paid our third-party manager a monthly fee equal to 3% of gross rentals collected from our real estate portfolio as compensation for its property management services. The increase in property management fees during the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily the result of growth in our portfolio as a result of additional property acquisitions and rent escalations.\nProperty and operating expense\nThe increase in property and operating expense was mainly attributable to the number of properties we own for which we are responsible for engaging a third-party manager to manage ongoing property maintenance, along with insurance and real estate taxes associated with those properties. We pay a majority of these expenses and are reimbursed by the tenants under the terms of the respective leases. There was a corresponding increase in operating expenses billed to tenants and included within Lease revenues.\nGeneral and administrative\nThe decrease in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019, was mainly attributable to a decrease in bad debt expense, which was approximately $1.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. As discussed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, prior to the adoption of ASC 842, provisions for doubtful accounts were recorded as bad debt expense and included in General and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Subsequent to the adoption of ASC 842 on January 1, 2019, provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded as an offset to Lease revenues, and totaled $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. As a result of the completion of the Internalization, our general and administrative expenses will include in the future direct employee compensation costs for 71 employees. In addition, our general and administrative expenses will include certain professional fees, consulting, portfolio servicing costs, and other general and administrative expenses not incurred under our previous externally managed structure. Given our current team and structure, we expect that as our portfolio grows, we will experience limited increases in general and administrative expenses in the next few years after 2020, as those expenses are expected to grow at a significantly slower rate than the overall portfolio and corresponding lease revenues.\nProvision for impairment of investment in rental properties\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized $3.5 million of impairment on our investments in rental properties. We review long-lived assets to be held and used for possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If and when such events or changes in circumstances are present, an impairment exists to the extent the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition. The impairments recognized during the year ended December 31, 2019, related to four properties whose carrying amounts we determined were not recoverable. In determining the fair value of the assets at the time of measurement, and depending on the specific property being evaluated, we utilized a capitalization rate of 14.6%, a weighted average discount rate of 8%, and a weighted average price per square foot of $226. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized $2.1 million of impairment on our investments in rental properties. The impairment related to five properties whose carrying amounts we determined were not recoverable. In determining the fair value of the assets at the time of measurement, and depending on the specific property being evaluated, we utilized capitalization rates ranging from 7.5% to 10%, and a weighted average discount rate of 8%.\nOther income (expenses)\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase/(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expenses)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Preferred distribution income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (440\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100.0\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (170\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (95.0\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (72,534\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (52,855\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,679\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (37.2\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of debt extinguishment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,176\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (101\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sale of real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,415\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (857\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,558\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sale of investment in related party\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,500\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100.0\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Internalization expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,658\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,658\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> >100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (94\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 94.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense\nThe increased interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2019, resulted primarily from an increase in average outstanding borrowings as compared to 2018, due primarily to the incurrence of indebtedness associated with the Industrial Portfolio Acquisition, partially offset by a 27 basis point decrease in our weighted average cost of debt, inclusive of our interest rate swaps. We were able to take advantage of the decreasing interest rates during the year, as our percentage of floating-rate debt increased concurrently with our funding of the Industrial Portfolio Acquisition. We also amended our 2024 Unsecured Term Loan in July 2019, to reduce the applicable margin from 1.90% to 1.25%.\nGain on sale of real estate\nOur recognition of a gain or loss on the sale of real estate varies from transaction to transaction based on fluctuations in asset prices and demand in the real estate market. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized gains of $29.9 million on the sale of 49 properties, compared to gains of $10.5 million on the sale of 20 properties during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nIncome taxes\nThe increase in income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2019, was mainly attributable to the U.S. federal and state taxes recognized on the gain on sale of certain properties held in our taxable REIT subsidiary during the fourth quarter of 2019, with no comparable activity during 2018.\nGain on sale of investment in related party\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold our investment of 100 non-voting convertible preferred units of BRE, a related party at such time, to Trident BRE LLC, another related party to BRE, for an aggregate sales price of $18.5 million. The preferred units had a carrying value of $10 million at the time of sale, resulting in a gain of $8.5 million. Prior to the sale, we received preferred distribution income on the preferred units.\nInternalization expenses\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred $3.7 million of third-party fees and consulting expenses associated with the Internalization.\nNet Income and Non-GAAP Measures (FFO and AFFO)\nOur reported results and net earnings per diluted share are presented in accordance with GAAP. We also disclose FFO and AFFO, each of which are non-GAAP measures. We believe the presentation of FFO and AFFO are useful to investors because they are widely accepted industry measures used by analysts and investors to compare the operating performance of REITs. FFO and AFFO should not be considered alternatives to net income as a performance measure or to cash flows from operations, as reported on our statement of cash flows, or as a liquidity measure, and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures.\nWe compute FFO in accordance with the standards established by the Board of Governors of Nareit, the worldwide representative voice for REITs and publicly traded real estate companies with an interest in the U.S. real estate and capital markets. Nareit defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude net gains (losses) from sales of certain depreciated real estate assets, depreciation and amortization expense from real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control, and impairment charges related to certain previously depreciated real estate assets. To derive AFFO, we modify the Nareit computation of FFO to include other adjustments to GAAP net income related to certain non-cash and non-recurring revenues and expenses, including straight-line rents, cost of debt extinguishments, amortization of lease intangibles, amortization of debt issuance costs, amortization of net mortgage premiums, (gain) loss on interest rate swaps and other non-cash interest expense, realized gains or losses on foreign currency transactions, internalization expenses, extraordinary items, and other specified non-cash items. We believe that such items are not a result of normal operations and thus we believe excluding such items assists management and investors in distinguishing whether changes in our operations are due to growth or decline of operations at our properties or from other factors.\nOur leases include cash rents that increase over the term of the lease to compensate us for anticipated increases in market rentals over time. Our leases do not include significant front-loading or back-loading of payments, or significant rent-free periods. Therefore, we find it useful to evaluate rent on a contractual basis as it allows for comparison of existing rental rates to market rental rates. We further exclude costs or gains recorded on the extinguishment of debt, non-cash interest expense and gains, the amortization of debt issuance costs, net mortgage premiums, and lease intangibles, realized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, and internalization expenses, as these items are not indicative of ongoing operational results. We use AFFO as a measure of our performance when we formulate corporate goals.\nFFO is used by management, investors, and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers, primarily because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions. We believe that AFFO is a useful supplemental measure for investors to consider because it will help them to better assess our operating performance without the distortions created by non-cash revenues or expenses. FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other REITs, and comparisons of our FFO and AFFO with the same or similar measures disclosed by other REITs may not be meaningful.\nNeither the SEC nor any other regulatory body has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments to FFO that we use to calculate AFFO. In the future, the SEC, Nareit or another regulatory body may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the REIT industry and in response to such standardization we may have to adjust our calculation and characterization of AFFO accordingly.\nThe following table presents our net income and our non-GAAP FFO and AFFO. Our measures of FFO and AFFO are computed on the basis of amounts attributable to both us and non-controlling interests. As the non-\ncontrolling interests share in our net income on a one-for-one basis, the basic and diluted per-share amounts are the same.\nTable 137: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase/(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands, except per share data)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 85,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 75,105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net earnings per diluted share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.12\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3.5\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FFO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 167,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 150,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,806\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FFO per diluted share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.51\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.88\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.37\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5.4\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AFFO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 149,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 124,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AFFO per diluted share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5.80\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5.66\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted WASO(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,910\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,806\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Weighted average number of shares of our common stock and OP Units outstanding ( WASO\u201d), computed in accordance with GAAP. \nNet income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, growth in net income was primarily attributable to revenue growth, as discussed in Results of Operations - Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018, combined with a $19.4 million increase in gains on sale of real estate. These factors were partially offset by a $24.8 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense associated with a larger real estate portfolio, a $19.7 million increase in interest expense associated with incremental borrowings used to partially fund our real estate acquisitions, and $3.7 million in internalization expenses incurred in 2019. We also recognized an $8.5 million gain on the sale of an investment in a related party during 2018, with no such activity in 2019.\nGAAP net income includes items such as gain or loss on sale of real estate and provisions for impairment, among others, which can vary from quarter to quarter and impact period-to-period comparisons. These fluctuations, coupled with our ongoing equity offering, resulted in a $0.12 decrease in net earnings per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nAFFO\nThe increase in AFFO during the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, was primarily driven by revenue growth in our real estate portfolio. This resulted from rent escalations associated with our same property portfolio, accretive acquisitions and strong portfolio operating performance.\nThe $0.14 increase in AFFO per diluted share was primarily the result of accretive acquisitions during the year, coupled with the positive per share impact of funding a larger portion of our acquisitions with lower costing debt compared to equity. We are committed to maintaining an investment grade balance sheet through active management of our leverage profile and overall liquidity position.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\nThe following is a reconciliation of net income to FFO and AFFO, which are non-GAAP financial measures.

Our focus is on maximizing the risk-adjusted return to our stockholders through an appropriate balance of debt and equity in our capital structure. We are committed to maintaining an investment grade balance sheet through active management of our leverage profile and overall liquidity position. We believe our leverage model has allowed us to take advantage of the lower cost of debt while simultaneously strengthening our balance sheet, as evidenced by our investment grade credit rating. As of December 31, 2019, our leverage ratio was 45.8% of the approximate market value of our assets, compared to 41.5% as of December 31, 2018. The increase was due to incremental borrowings associated with funding the Industrial Portfolio Acquisition during the third quarter of 2019. Following the Industrial Portfolio Acquisition, we have reduced our leverage profile using a combination of proceeds from our private offering of shares of our common stock and increasing disposition activity. As a result of our announcing the Industrial Portfolio Acquisition, Moody's affirmed our investment grade credit rating and stable outlook.\nLiquidity/REIT Requirements\nLiquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including our ongoing commitments to repay debt, fund our operations, acquire properties, make distributions to our stockholders, and other general business needs. As a REIT, we are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain, on an annual basis. As a result, it is unlikely that we will be able to retain substantial cash balances to meet our liquidity needs from our annual taxable income. Instead, we expect to meet our liquidity needs primarily by relying upon external sources of capital.\nShort-term Liquidity Requirements\nOur short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for our operating expenses, including our general and administrative expenses as well as interest payments on our outstanding debt and to pay distributions. Since our portfolio has a strong occupancy level and substantially all of our leases are net leases, we do not currently anticipate making significant capital expenditures or incurring other significant property costs. We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements primarily from cash and cash equivalents balances, net cash provided by operating activities, and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.\nLong-term Liquidity Requirements\nOur long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to repay debt and invest in additional revenue generating properties. Debt capital is provided through unsecured term notes, revolving debt facilities, and senior unsecured notes.\nThe source and mix of our debt capital in the future will be impacted by market conditions as well as our continued focus on lengthening our debt maturity profile to better align with our portfolio's lease terms, staggering debt maturities to reduce the risk that a significant amount of debt will mature in any single year in the future, and managing our exposure to interest rate risk.\nWe expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements primarily from borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility, future debt and equity financings, and proceeds from limited sales of our properties. Our ability to access these capital sources may be impacted by unfavorable market conditions, particularly in the debt and equity capital markets, that are outside of our control. In addition, our success will depend on our operating performance, our borrowing restrictions, our degree of leverage, and other factors. Our acquisition growth strategy significantly depends on our ability to obtain acquisition financing on favorable terms. We seek to reduce the risk that long-term debt capital may be unavailable to us by strengthening our balance sheet by investing in real estate with creditworthy tenants and lease guarantors, and by maintaining an appropriate mix of debt and equity capitalization. We also, from time to time, obtain or assume non-recourse mortgage financing from banks and insurance companies secured by mortgages on the corresponding specific property. Mortgages, however, are not currently a strategic focus of the active management of our leverage profile. Rather, we enter into mortgages and notes payable as ancillary business transactions on an as-needed basis, most often as the result of lease assumption transactions.\nEquity Capital Resources\nEquity capital for our real estate acquisition activity has historically been provided from the proceeds of our private offering, including distributions reinvested through our DRIP. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we raised $394.4 million in equity capital to be used in our acquisition activities, of which $329.8 million was received through new cash investments and $64.6 million was raised through our DRIP. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we raised $283.7 million in equity capital, of which $215.7 million was received through new cash investments, $52.2 million was raised through our DRIP, and $15.8 million was raised in exchange for OP Units through UPREIT transactions.\nCredit Rating\nWe achieved our current investment grade credit rating of Baa3 based on our conservative leverage profile, diversified real estate investment portfolio, access to capital, and earnings stability provided by the creditworthiness of our tenants. Factors that could negatively impact our credit rating include, but are not limited to: a significant increase in our leverage on a sustained basis, a significant increase in the proportion of secured debt levels, a significant decline in our unencumbered asset base, weakening of our corporate governance structure, and a significant decline in our real estate portfolio diversification or the creditworthiness of our tenants. Factors that could positively impact our credit rating include, but are not limited to, continued growth in the portfolio, improvement in our leverage profile, lengthening of our debt maturity profile, and our Internalization. We have aligned our strategic growth priorities with these factors, as we believe the favorable debt pricing and access to multiple sources of debt capital resulting from our investment grade credit rating provides us with an advantageous cost of capital and risk-adjusted return on investment for our stockholders.\nRecent Activity\nOn February 7, 2020, we entered into a $60 million term loan agreement maturing February 28, 2022 (the 2022 Unsecured Term Loan\u201d) with JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent. The 2022 Unsecured Term Loan was fully funded at closing and used to partially repay BRE debt that had been assumed by the Company as part of the Internalization. Borrowings under the 2022 Unsecured Term Loan are subject to interest only payments at variable rates equal to LIBOR plus a margin based on our credit rating, ranging between 0.85% and 1.65% per annum. Based on our current credit rating, the applicable margin is 1.25%.\nExisting Credit Facilities\nThe following table sets forth our outstanding Revolving Credit Facility, unsecured term loans and Senior Notes as of December 31, 2019.\nTable 140: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Maturity\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands, except interest rates)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Date\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2020 Unsecured Term Loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> one-month LIBOR + 1.25%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Aug. 2020\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credit Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revolving Credit Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 197,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> one-month LIBOR + 1.20%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Jan. 2022\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2023 Unsecured Term Loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 265,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> one-month LIBOR + 1.35%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Jan. 2023\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2024 Unsecured Term Loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 190,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> one-month LIBOR + 1.25%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Jun. 2024\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 652,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2026 Unsecured Term Loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 450,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> one-month LIBOR + 1.85%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Feb. 2026\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Series A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 150,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.84%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Apr. 2027\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Series B\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 225,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.09%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Jul. 2028\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Series C\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.19%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Jul. 2030\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 475,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,877,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevolving Credit Facility\nThe Revolving Credit Facility has a maximum availability of $600 million, and includes a $35 million sublimit for swingline loans and $20 million available for issuance of letters of credit. The Revolving Credit Facility has an initial maturity date of January 2022 and provides for one five-month extension, at our election, subject to certain conditions set forth in the agreement and payment of a 0.0625% fee on the revolving commitments. The Revolving Credit Facility contains an applicable facility fee ranging between 0.125% and 0.30% per annum, based on our credit rating. Based on our current credit rating of Baa3, the facility fee is 0.25% per annum as of December 31, 2019.\nBorrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at variable rates based on LIBOR plus a margin based on our credit rating ranging between 0.825% and 1.55% per annum. Based on our current credit rating, the applicable margin is 1.20% as of December 31, 2019.\n2020 Unsecured Term Loan\nThe 2020 Unsecured Term loan has an initial maturity date of August 2020. Borrowings under the 2020 Unsecured Term Loan bear interest at variable rates based on LIBOR plus a margin based on our credit rating ranging between 0.85% and 1.65% per annum.

Borrowings under the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan bear interest at variable rates based on LIBOR plus a margin based on our credit rating ranging between 0.90% and 1.75% per annum. Based on our current credit rating, the applicable margin is 1.35% as of December 31, 2019.\n2024 Unsecured Term Loan\nThe 2024 Unsecured Term Loan has an initial maturity date of June 2024. Borrowings under the 2024 Unsecured Term Loan are subject to interest at variable rates based on LIBOR plus a margin based on our credit rating ranging between 0.85% and 1.65% per annum. Based on our current credit rating, the applicable margin is 1.25% as of December 31, 2019.\n2026 Unsecured Term Loan\nThe 2026 Unsecured Term Loan includes an accordion feature that provides for an increase in the facility size up to a total of $550 million of available capacity. Borrowings under the 2026 Unsecured Term Loan are payable interest only on a monthly basis during the term of the loan, with the principal amount due in February 2026. Borrowings under the 2026 Unsecured Term loan bear interest equal to LIBOR plus a margin based on our credit rating ranging between 1.45% and 2.40% per annum. Based on our current grade credit rating, the applicable margin is 1.85% as of December 31, 2019.\nSenior Notes\nTo mitigate interest rate risk, we have strategically added unsecured, fixed-rate, interest-only senior promissory notes ( Senior Notes\u201d) to our capital structure. The Senior Notes were issued in three series (Series A, B, and C) as described below.\nSeries A Notes\nThe Series A Notes are payable interest only semiannually during their term, bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.84% per annum, and mature on April 18, 2027.\nSeries B and Series C Notes\nThe Series B Notes mature on July 2, 2028, and the Series C Notes mature on July 2, 2030. The Series B and Series C Notes are payable interest only semiannually during their term, and bear interest at fixed rates of 5.09% per annum and 5.19% per annum, respectively.\nDebt Covenants\nWe are subject to various covenants and financial reporting requirements pursuant to our debt facilities. The table below summarizes the applicable financial covenants, which are substantially the same across each of our debt facilities. As of December 31, 2019, we believe that we were in compliance with all of our covenants. In the event of default, either through default on payments or breach of covenants, we may be restricted from paying dividends to our stockholders in excess of dividends required to maintain our REIT qualification. For each of the previous three years, we paid dividends out of our cash flows from operations in excess of the distribution amounts required to maintain our REIT qualification.\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td> Covenants\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Required\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Actual\n(as of\nDecember 31,\n2019)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Leverage Ratio(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2264 0.60 to 1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.50\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Secured Indebtedness Ratio(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2264 0.40 to 1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.03\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unencumbered Coverage Ratio(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2265 1.75 to 1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.50\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2265 1.50 to 1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.85\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Unsecured Indebtedness to Total\nUnencumbered Eligible Property Value(5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2264 0.60 to 1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.53\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dividends and Other Restricted Payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Only applicable\nin case of default\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Not\nApplicable\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) The leverage ratio is calculated as the ratio of total indebtedness to total market value. For debt covenant purposes, total market value is computed on a consolidated basis as the net operating income for the most recently completed fiscal quarter on properties owned for four consecutive quarters at a capitalization rate of 7.50%, multiplied by four, plus the acquisition price of properties acquired in the last four quarters, and the GAAP book value of mortgages receivable, development property, unimproved real estate, unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, and all other tangible assets (the latter subject to a cap of 5% of total market value). For purposes of determining total market value, net operating income from properties disposed of during the immediately preceding period of four consecutive fiscal quarters are excluded. \n (2) The secured indebtedness ratio is the ratio of secured indebtedness to total market value. Secured indebtedness represents outstanding mortgage borrowings. \n (3) The unencumbered coverage ratio is the ratio of net operating income for all eligible properties to unsecured interest expense for the most recent fiscal quarter. \n (4) The fixed charge coverage ratio is the ratio of adjusted EBITDA to fixed charges for the most recent fiscal quarter. Adjusted EBITDA is computed as net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization, interest expense, income tax expense and franchise tax expense, gains and losses from the sale of properties, equity in net income of unconsolidated subsidiaries, non-cash expenses related to mark to market exposure under derivatives contracts, straight-line rent adjustments, amortization of intangibles, gains and losses on early extinguishment of debt, non-cash severance and restructuring charges, transaction costs expensed, and reserves for replacements with respect to certain properties. Fixed charges are computed as interest expense, plus scheduled principal repayments of debt, excluding balloon payments if applicable, plus preferred dividends paid or accrued, if applicable. \n (5) The ratio is calculated as the ratio of total unsecured indebtedness to unencumbered property value. \nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk arising from changes in interest rates on the floating-rate borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities and a certain mortgage. Borrowings pursuant to our unsecured credit facilities and the mortgage bear interest at floating rates based on LIBOR plus an applicable margin. Accordingly, fluctuations in market interest rates may increase or decrease our interest expense, which will in turn, increase or decrease our net income and cash flow.\nWe attempt to manage our interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swaps. As of December 31, 2019, we had 34 interest rate swaps outstanding in an aggregate notional amount of $909.9 million. Under these agreements, we receive monthly payments from the counterparties equal to the related variable interest rates multiplied by the outstanding notional amounts. In turn, we pay the counterparties each month an amount equal to a fixed interest rate multiplied by the related outstanding notional amounts. The intended net impact of these transactions is that we pay a fixed interest rate on our variable-rate borrowings. The interest rate swaps have been designated by us as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes and are reported at fair value. We assess, both at inception and on an ongoing basis, the effectiveness of our qualifying cash flow hedges. We have not entered, and do not intend to enter, into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes.\nCash Flows\nCash and cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled $20.3 million, $19.0 million, and $10.1 million at December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The table below shows information concerning cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017:\nTable 147: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the years ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 147,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 128,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 97,940\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (831,707\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (510,459\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (611,835\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 685,671\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 391,338\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 500,891\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents and restricted\ncash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,890\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (13,004\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in net cash provided by operating activities during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, as compared to the comparable prior periods, was mainly due to growth in our real estate portfolio.\nThe increase in net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, reflected increased outflows for the acquisition of properties, most notably the Industrial Portfolio Acquisition. In addition, during the 2018 period, we received $18.5 million from the sale of our investment in preferred units of BRE, with no such cash inflow in 2019. These factors were somewhat offset by increased proceeds from the disposal of properties as we actively manage our balance sheet following the Industrial Portfolio Acquisition. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, mainly reflected lower outflows for the acquisition of properties, combined with the cash received on the sale of the preferred units of BRE.\nThe increase in net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, mainly reflects net incremental borrowings and increased proceeds from the issuance of our common stock, which were used to fund the increased acquisition activity, partially offset by increased distributions resulting from an increase in the number of shares of common stock outstanding. The decrease in net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, mainly reflected lower net borrowings due to lower acquisition volume, combined with lower proceeds from the sale of common stock reflective of the equity cap and queue program that we instituted in November 2017 to better match fund inflows from equity investments with outflows for acquisitions.\nImpact of Inflation\nThe leases in our portfolio are long-term in nature, with a current ABR weighted average remaining lease term of 11.5 years as of December 31, 2019. Our rental revenues may be impacted by inflation. Substantially all of our leases have contractual lease escalations, with an ABR weighted average of 2.1% as of December 31, 2019. Many of our leases contain rent escalators that increase rent at a fixed amount and may not be sufficient during periods of high inflation. Leases that contributed approximately 15.9% of our ABR as of December 31, 2019, contained rent escalators based on increases in CPI and the associated increases in rental revenue may be limited during periods of low inflation. The impact of inflation on our property and operating expenses is limited since substantially all of our leases are net leases, and property-level expenses are generally paid by our tenants. To the extent we bear the cost of such expense, we attempt to limit our exposure to inflation through the use of warranties and other remedies that reduce the likelihood of a significant capital outlay. Inflation and increased costs may also have an adverse impact to our tenants and their creditworthiness if the increase in property-level expenses is greater than their increase in revenues.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2019, or December 31, 2018.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table provides information with respect to our contractual commitments and obligations as of December 31, 2019 (in thousands).\nTable 148: <table> <tr> <td> Year of\nMaturity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Term Loan\nAgreements(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Revolving Credit Facility(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Senior\nNotes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Mortgages\nand Notes\nPayable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Interest\nExpense(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Tenant\nImprovement\nAllowances(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Operating\nLeases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,210\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 74,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 380,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,028\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 68,961\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 87,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 197,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 61,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 261,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 265,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 52,708\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 326,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 190,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 240,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 450,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 475,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 77,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 116,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,411\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,121,355\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,205,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 197,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 475,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 112,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 422,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,992\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,418,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) We may extend the 2020 Unsecured Term Loan twice, each time for a six-month period, subject to certain conditions, including the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.05% of the aggregate principal amount of loans outstanding. \n (2) We may extend the Revolving Credit Facility once, for a five-month period, subject to certain conditions, including the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.0625% of the revolving commitments. \n (3) Interest expense is projected based on the outstanding borrowings and interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2019. This amount includes the impact of interest rate swap agreements. \n (4) We expect to pay tenant improvement allowances out of cash flows from operations or from additional borrowings. \nAt December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, investment in rental property of $178.7 million and $139.8 million, respectively, was pledged as collateral against our mortgages and notes payable.\nAdditionally, we are a party to three separate tax protection agreements with the contributing members of three distinct UPREIT transactions and we entered into the Founding Owners' Tax Protection Agreement with the Founding Owners in connection with the Internalization. The tax protection agreements require us to indemnify the beneficiaries in the event of a sale, exchange, transfer, or other disposal of the contributed property, or in the case of the Founding Owners' Tax Protection Agreement, the entire Company, in a taxable transaction that would cause such beneficiaries to recognize a gain that is protected under the agreements, subject to certain exceptions. Based on values as of December 31, 2019, taxable sales would trigger liability under the four tax protection agreements of approximately $22.3 million. Based on information available, we do not believe that the events resulting in damages as detailed above have occurred or are likely to occur in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, we have excluded these commitments from the contractual commitments table above.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses as well as other disclosures in the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and assumptions; however, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions, which in turn could have a material impact on our financial statements. A summary of our significant accounting policies and procedures are included in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d, contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nInvestments in Rental Property\nWe record investments in rental property accounted for under operating leases at cost. We record investments in rental property accounted for under direct financing leases at their net investment (which at the inception of the lease generally represents the cost of the property).\nWe early adopted ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business ( ASU 2017-01\u201d), on a prospective basis, effective January 1, 2017. The guidance changes the definition of a business to exclude acquisitions where substantially all of the fair value of the assets acquired are concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets, and therefore are accounted for as asset acquisitions instead of business combinations. All of our acquisitions of real estate closed subsequent to adopting ASU 2017-01 are accounted for as asset acquisitions.\nWe allocate the purchase price of investments in rental property accounted for as asset acquisitions based on the relative fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. These generally include tangible assets, consisting of land and land improvements, buildings and other improvements, and equipment, and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities, including the value of in-place leases and acquired above-market and below-market leases. Acquisition costs incurred in connection with investments in real estate accounted for as asset acquisitions are capitalized and included with the allocated purchase price. The results of operations of acquired properties are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income from the respective date of acquisition.\nWe allocate the purchase price of investments in rental property accounted for as a business combination based on the estimated fair value at the date of the acquisition of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. These generally include tangible assets, consisting of land and land improvements, buildings and other improvements, and equipment, and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities, including the value of in-place leases and acquired above-market and below-market leases. Acquisition costs incurred in connection with investments in real estate accounted for as business combinations are expensed at the time of acquisition. The results of operations of acquired properties are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income from the respective date of acquisition.\nWe use multiple sources to estimate fair value, including information obtained about each property as a result of our pre-acquisition due diligence and our marketing and leasing activities. Factors that impact our fair value determination include real estate market conditions, industry conditions that the tenant operates in, and characteristics of the real estate and/or real estate appraisals. Changes in any of these factors could impact the future purchase prices of our investments and the corresponding capitalization rates recognized. We do not believe the assumptions used to fair value the investments upon acquisition have a significant degree of estimation uncertainty.\nWe determine the fair value of tangible assets of an acquired property by valuing the property as if it were vacant. Management then allocates the as-if-vacant value to land and land improvements, buildings, and equipment based on comparable sales and other relevant information with respect to the property, as estimated by management. Specifically, the if vacant\u201d value of buildings and equipment is calculated using an income approach. Assumptions used in the income approach to value buildings include: capitalization and discount rates, lease-up time, market rents, make ready costs, land value, and land improvement value.\nThe estimated fair value of acquired in-place leases equals the costs we would have had to incur to lease the properties to the occupancy level of the properties at the date of acquisition. Such costs include the fair value of leasing commissions and other operating costs that would have been incurred to lease the properties, had they been vacant, to their acquired occupancy level. We amortize acquired in-place leases as of the date of acquisition over the remaining initial non-cancellable terms of the respective leases to amortization expense.\nWe record acquired above-market and below-market lease values based on the present value (using an interest rate that reflects the risks associated with the lease acquired) of the differences between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and management's estimate of fair market value lease rates at the time of acquisition for the corresponding in-place leases. We amortize the capitalized above-market and below-market lease values as adjustments to rental revenue over the remaining term of the respective leases.\nShould a tenant terminate its lease, we charge the unamortized portion of the in-place lease value to amortization expense and we charge the unamortized portion of above-market or below-market lease value to rental income.\nManagement estimates the fair value of assumed mortgages and notes payable based upon indications of then-current market pricing for similar types of debt with similar maturities. We record assumed mortgages and notes payable at their estimated fair value as of the assumption date, and the difference between the estimated fair value and the notes' outstanding principal balance is amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the debt.\nLong-lived Asset Impairment\nWe review long-lived assets to be held and used for possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If, and when, such events or changes in circumstances are present, an impairment exists to the extent the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition. Such cash flows include expected future operating income, as adjusted for trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition, and other factors. An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group. A significant judgment is made as to if and when impairment should be taken. If our strategy, or one or more of the assumptions described above were to change in the future, an impairment may need to be recognized.\nInputs used in establishing fair value for real estate assets generally fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, which are characterized as requiring significant judgment as little or no current market activity may be available for validation. The main indicator used to establish the classification of the inputs is current market conditions, as derived through our use of published commercial real estate market information. We determine the valuation of impaired assets using generally accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis, income capitalization, analysis of recent comparable sales transactions, actual sales negotiations, and bona fide purchase offers received from third parties. We may consider a single valuation technique or multiple valuation techniques, as appropriate, when estimating the fair value of real estate.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, we recorded impairment charges of $3.5 million, $2.1 million, and $2.6 million, respectively. Impairment indicators were identified due to concerns over each tenant's future viability, property vacancies, and changes to the overall investment strategy for the real estate assets. In determining the fair value of the real estate assets at the time of measurement, and depending on the property being evaluated, we utilized capitalization rates ranging from 7.25% to 12.0%, a weighted average discount rate of 8.0%, and a weighted average price per square foot of $226, which are Level 3 inputs. We believe the uncertainty in the future cash flows was reflected in the significant capitalization rate, and the estimates were based on the information available at the time of impairment. The properties for which an impairment charge was recorded in 2018 were subsequently sold in 2019. One of the properties for which an impairment charge was recorded in 2017 was subsequently sold in 2018. The assumptions we used in determining the amount of the impairment charges on these properties were validated upon the subsequent sales, which were at values consistent with our originally estimated impaired values. We classified the impairment charge within earnings from operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company commences revenue recognition on its leases based on a number of factors, including the initial determination that the contract is or contains a lease. Generally, all of the Company's property related contracts are or contain leases, and therefore revenue is recognized when the lessee takes possession of or controls the physical use of the leased assets. In most instances this occurs on the lease commencement date. At the time of lease assumption or at the inception of a new lease, including new leases that arise from amendments, the Company assesses the terms and conditions of the lease to determine the proper lease classification.\nCertain of the Company's leases require tenants to pay rent based upon a percentage of the property's net sales ( percentage rent\u201d) or contain rent escalators indexed to future changes in the CPI. Lease income associated with such provisions is considered variable lease income and therefore is not included in the initial measurement of the lease receivable, or in the calculation of straight-line rent revenue. Such amounts are recognized as income when the amounts are determinable.\nAs described in Recently Adopted Accounting Standards in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) and related ASUs subsequently issued (collectively, ASC 842\u201d) as of January 1, 2019.\nLeases Executed on or After Adoption of ASC 842\nA lease is classified as an operating lease if none of the following criteria are met: (i) ownership transfers to the lessee at the end of the lease term, (ii) the lessee has a purchase option that is reasonably expected to be exercised, (iii) the lease term is for a major part of the economic life of the leased property, (iv) the present value of the future lease payments and any residual value guaranteed by the lessee that is not already reflected in the lease payments equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the leased property, and (v) the leased property is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no future alternative use to the Company at the end of the lease term. If one or more of these criteria are met, the lease will generally be classified as a sales-type lease, unless the lease contains a residual value guarantee from a third party other than the lessee, in which case it would be classified as a direct financing lease under certain circumstances in accordance with ASC 842.\nASC 842 requires the Company to account for the right to use land as a separate lease component, unless the accounting effect of doing so would be insignificant. Determination of significance requires management judgment. In determining whether the accounting effect of separately reporting the land component from other components for its real estate leases is significant, the Company assesses: (i) whether separating the land component impacts the classification of any lease component, (ii) the value of the land component in the context of the overall contract, and (iii) whether the right to use the land is coterminous with the rights to use the other assets.\nLeases Executed Prior to Adoption of ASC 842\nA lease arrangement was classified as an operating lease if none of the following criteria were met: (i) ownership transferred to the lessee prior to or shortly after the end of the lease term, (ii) the lessee had a bargain purchase option during or at the end of the lease term, (iii) the lease term was greater than or equal to 75% of the underlying property's estimated useful life, or (iv) the present value of the future minimum lease payments (excluding executory costs) was greater than or equal to 90% of the fair value of the leased property. If one or more of these criteria were met, and the minimum lease payments were determined to be reasonably predictable and collectible, the lease arrangement was generally accounted for as a direct financing lease. Consistent with ASC 840, Leases, if the fair value of the land component was 25% or more of the total fair value of the leased property, the land was considered separately from the building for purposes of applying the lease term and minimum lease payments criterion in (iii) and (iv) above.\nRevenue recognition methods for operating leases, direct financing leases, and sales-type leases are described below:\nRental property accounted for under operating leases - Revenue is recognized as rents are earned on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable terms of the related leases. For leases that have fixed and measurable rent escalations, the difference between such rental income earned and the cash rent due under the provisions of the lease is recorded as Accrued rental income on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nRental property accounted for under direct financing leases - The Company utilizes the direct finance method of accounting to record direct financing lease income. The net investment in the direct financing lease represents receivables for the sum of future lease payments to be received and the estimated residual value of the leased property, less unamortized unearned income (which represents the difference between undiscounted cash flows and discounted cash flows). Unearned income is deferred and amortized into income over the lease terms so as to produce a constant periodic rate of return on the Company's net investment in the leases.\nRental property accounted for under sales-type leases - For leases accounted for as sales-type leases, the Company records selling profit arising from the lease at inception, along with the net investment in the lease. The Company leases assets through the assumption of existing leases or through sale-leaseback transactions, and records such assets at their fair value at the time of acquisition, which in most cases coincides with lease inception. As a result, the Company does not generally recognize selling profit on sales-type leases. The net investment in the sales-type lease represents receivables for the sum of future lease payments and the estimated unguaranteed residual value of the leased property, each measured at net present value. Interest income is recorded over the lease terms so as to produce a constant periodic rate of return on the Company's net investment in the leases.\nCertain of the Company's contracts contain nonlease components (e.g., charges for management fees, common area maintenance, and reimbursement of third-party maintenance expenses) in addition to lease components (i.e., monthly rental charges). Services related to nonlease components are provided over the same period of time as, and billed in the same manner as, monthly rental charges. The Company elected to apply the practical expedient available under ASC 842, for all classes of assets, not to separate the lease components from the nonlease components when accounting for operating leases. Since the lease component is the predominant component under each of these leases, combined revenues from both the lease and nonlease components are reported as Lease revenues in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\nManagement uses interest rate swap agreements to manage risks related to interest rate movements on our variable-rate debt. The interest rate swap agreements, designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges, are reported at fair value. We adopted ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting and Hedging Activities, effective January 1, 2018 on a modified retrospective basis. ASU 2017-12 amended the designation and measurement guidance for qualifying hedging transactions and the presentation of hedge results in an entity's financial statements.\nPrior to the adoption of ASU 2017-12, the gain or loss on the effective portion of the hedge was initially included as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and was subsequently reclassified into earnings when interest payments on the related debt were incurred and as the swap net settlements occurred. If and when there was ineffectiveness realized on a swap agreement, the Company recognized the ineffectiveness as a component of interest expense in the period incurred.\nASU 2017-12 removed the concept of separately measuring and reporting hedge ineffectiveness and requires a company to present the earnings effect of the hedging instrument in the same income statement line item in which the earnings effect of the hedged item is reported. In accordance with ASU 2017-12, the gain or loss on the qualifying hedges is initially included as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and is subsequently reclassified into earnings when interest payments (the forecasted transactions) on the related debt are incurred and as the swap net settlements occur.\nWhen an existing cash flow hedge is terminated, we determine the accounting treatment for the accumulated gain or loss recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, based on the probability of the hedged forecasted transaction occurring within the period the cash flow hedge was anticipated to affect earnings. If management determines that the hedged forecasted transaction is probable of occurring during the original period, the accumulated gain or loss is reclassified into earnings over the remaining life of the cash flow hedge using a straight-line method, which approximates an effective interest method. If management determines that the hedged forecasted transaction is not probable of occurring during the original period, the entire amount of accumulated gain or loss is reclassified into earnings in the period the cash flow hedge is terminated.\nManagement documents its risk management strategy and hedge effectiveness at the inception of and during the term of each hedge. Our interest rate risk management strategy is intended to stabilize cash flow requirements by maintaining interest rate swap agreements to convert certain variable-rate debt to a fixed rate.\nImpact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information on the impact of recent accounting pronouncements on our business, see the captions Recently Adopted Accounting Standards and Other Recently Issued Accounting Standards in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_text": "Item 7.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. This MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe acquire, own, and manage primarily single-tenant commercial real estate properties that are net leased on a long-term basis to a diversified group of tenants. Since our inception in 2007, we have selectively invested in net leased assets in the industrial, healthcare, restaurant, office, and retail property types, and as of December 31, 2019, our portfolio has grown to 645 properties in 41 U.S. states and one property in Canada.\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from rents received from single tenants of each of our net leased properties in our portfolio. We typically lease our properties pursuant to long-term net leases with initial terms of 10 years or more that often have renewal options. As of December 31, 2019, leases contributing approximately 98.4% of our ABR provided for periodic rent escalations, generally ranging from 1.5% to 2.5% annually, with an ABR weighted average minimum increase of 2.1%. As of December 31, 2019, our properties were occupied by approximately 186 different commercial tenants who operate 169 different brands that are diversified across 54 differing industries, with no single tenant accounting for more than 2.8% of our ABR.\nIn order to benefit from increasing economies of scale as we continue to grow, our board of directors made the decision to internalize our management structure, which was completed on February 7, 2020. In connection with the Internalization, we terminated our management agreements with BRE, entered into employment agreements with each of our named executive officers, and began directly employing 71 former employees of BRE. Our historical results of operations through December 31, 2019, include the payment of management fees that we will no longer pay following the Internalization and do not include the direct compensation expense associated with our 71 employees, or certain professional fees, consulting, portfolio servicing costs, and other general and administrative expenses not previously incurred based upon our externally managed structure. No amounts were payable to BRE under the termination provisions of the management agreements related to the Internalization.\nFactors that Affect Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nOur results of operations and financial condition are affected by numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. Key factors that impact our results of operations and financial condition include rental rates, lease renewals and occupancy, acquisition volume, net lease terms, financing arrangements and leverage, property dispositions, general and administrative expenses, inflation, and tenant bankruptcies.\nRental Rates\nOur ability to grow rental revenue from our existing portfolio will depend on our ability to realize the rental escalations built into our leases. As of December 31, 2019, leases contributing approximately 98.4% of our ABR provided for increases in future annual base rent, generally ranging from 1.5% to 2.5% annually, with an ABR weighted average minimum increase of 2.1% of base rent. Generally, our rent escalators increase rent on specified dates by a fixed percentage. Approximately 15.9% of our rent escalators are based on an increase in the CPI over a specified period and 1.6% of our leases are flat leases, meaning they do not provide for rent increases during their terms. During periods of low inflation, small increases in the CPI will result in limited increases in rental revenue from our leases that contain rent escalators based on CPI increases. However, when the CPI decreases or does not change over the relevant period, our rental revenue from such leases is not reduced and will remain the same.\nProperty Dispositions\nFrom time to time, we will strategically dispose of properties, primarily where we believe the risk profile has changed and become misaligned with our then current risk-adjusted return objectives. The resulting gains or losses on\ndispositions may materially impact our operating results. The recognition of a gain or loss on the sale of real estate varies from transaction to transaction based on fluctuations in asset prices and demand in the real estate market at the time a property is listed for sale.\nLease Renewals and Occupancy\nAs of December 31, 2019, the ABR weighted average remaining term of our leases was approximately 11.5 years, excluding renewal options. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 8.6% of our leases (based on ABR) will expire prior to January 1, 2025. See Item 1. Business, Our Leases\u201d. The stability of the rental revenue generated by our properties depends principally on our tenants' ability to pay rent and our ability to collect rents, renew expiring leases or re-lease space upon the expiration or other termination of leases, lease currently vacant properties, and maintain or increase rental rates at our leased properties. To the extent our properties become vacant, we would forego rental income while remaining responsible for the payment of property taxes and maintaining the property until it is re-leased, which could negatively impact our operating results. However, given our historically strong occupancy rates (since our inception, occupancy has generally been above 99%), we do not anticipate that such impact will be significant.\nAcquisition Volume\nOur historical growth in revenues and earnings has been achieved through rent escalations associated with existing in-place leases, coupled with rental income generated from accretive property acquisitions. Our ability to grow revenue will depend, to a significant degree, on our ability to acquire additional properties. Our ability to grow requires us to identify and complete acquisitions that meet our investment criteria. Changes in capitalization rates, interest rates, or other factors may impact our acquisition opportunities in the future. Market conditions may also impact the total returns we can achieve on our investments. Our acquisition volume also depends on our ability to access third-party debt and equity financing to fund our capital needs.\nNet Lease Terms\nSubstantially all of our leases are net leases pursuant to which our tenant generally is obligated to pay all expenses associated with the leased property including real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance, repairs, and capital costs. A limited number of leases require us to pay some or all of the property expenses such as the cost of environmental liabilities, roof and structure repairs, real estate taxes, insurance, or certain non-structural repairs and maintenance. An increase in the number of leases in which we are responsible for some or all of these expenses could negatively influence our operating results. Additionally, we seek to use master lease structures where it fits market practice in the particular property type, pursuant to which we seek to lease multiple properties to a single tenant on an all or none basis. Master leases strengthen our ability to preserve rental revenue and prevent costs associated with vacancies for underperforming properties. We believe the master lease structure is most prevalent and applicable to leases in our restaurant and retail property types, while less relevant to our other property types, such as healthcare and industrial. As of December 31, 2019, master leases contributed approximately 36.0% of our overall ABR (our largest master lease by ABR related to 24 properties and contributed 2.5% of our ABR, and our smallest master lease by ABR related to two properties and contributed 0.1% of our ABR), 74.1% of our restaurant property ABR (166 of our 249 restaurant properties), and 67.2% of our retail property ABR (85 of our 129 properties).\nInterest Expense\nWe anticipate that we will continue to incur debt in the future in order to fund future acquisition activity, which will increase the amount of interest expense we incur. In addition, although we attempt to limit our total floating-rate debt exposure, changes in the interest rate environment could either increase or decrease our weighted average interest rate in the future. Any changes to our debt structure or debt financing associated with property acquisitions, could materially influence our operating results depending on the terms of any such debt.\nProperty Management and Asset Management Fees\nFollowing completion of the Internalization, in February 2020, we will no longer pay property management and asset management fees, which had historically increased in correlation to the size of our portfolio.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nFollowing completion of the Internalization, our general and administrative expenses will include direct employee compensation costs for our 71 employees. In addition, our general and administrative expenses include certain professional fees, consulting, portfolio servicing costs, and other general and administrative expenses not previously incurred based upon our externally managed structure. Given our current team and structure, we expect that as our portfolio grows, we will experience limited increases in general and administrative expenses in the next few years after 2020, as those expenses are expected to grow at a significantly slower rate than the overall portfolio and corresponding lease revenues.\nImpact of Inflation\nOur rental revenues may be impacted by inflation. Many of our leases contain rent escalators that increase rent at a fixed amount and may not be sufficient during periods of high inflation. Leases that contributed approximately 15.9% of our ABR as of December 31, 2019, contained rent escalators based on increases in CPI and the associated increases in rental revenue may be limited during periods of low inflation. The impact of inflation on our property and operating expenses is limited since substantially all of our leases are net leases, and property-level expenses are generally paid by our tenants. To the extent we bear the cost of such expense, we attempt to limit our exposure to inflation through the use of warranties and other remedies that reduce the likelihood of a significant capital outlay. Inflation and increased costs may also have an adverse impact to our tenants and their creditworthiness if the increase in property-level expenses is greater than their increase in revenues.\nTenant Bankruptcies\nAdverse economic conditions, particularly those that affect the markets in which our properties are located, or downturns in our tenants' industries could impair our tenants' ability to meet their lease obligations to us and our ability to renew expiring leases or re-lease space. In particular, the bankruptcy of one or more of our tenants could adversely affect our ability to collect rents from such tenant and maintain our portfolio's occupancy. We have historically experienced only a limited number of tenant bankruptcies, which have not been material to our historical results.\nResults of Operations\nOur historical results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, discussed below, include the payment of asset and property management fees that we will no longer pay following the Internalization, and do not include the expected direct compensation expense associated with 71 employees employed by us following the Internalization or incremental general and administrative expenses.\nDiscussion of our Results of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 was previously filed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d under the heading Results of Operations-Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017.\u201d\nOverview\nAs of December 31, 2019, our real estate investment portfolio had a net book value of $3.5 billion, consisting of investments in 645 commercial real estate properties with locations in 41 states and one real estate property located in British Columbia, Canada, and leased to tenants in various industries. All but four of our properties were subject to a lease as of December 31, 2019, and substantially all of our leasing activity related to our real estate acquisitions.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\nLease revenues\n\nThe increase in lease revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily attributable to the growth in our real estate portfolio, which was achieved through rent escalations associated with our same property portfolio, coupled with rental revenue generated from accretive property acquisitions and continued strong portfolio operating performance. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we acquired 74 new properties for $1.0 billion, excluding capitalized acquisition costs. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we experienced greater than 99% rent collection and occupancy (based on rentable square footage). As of December 31, 2019, the ABR weighted average annual rent increases on our portfolio was 2.1%.\nOperating Expenses\n\nDepreciation and amortization\nThe increase in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily due to the growth in our real estate portfolio, as discussed above.\nAsset management fees\nWe paid our third-party manager a quarterly fee equal to 0.25% of the aggregate value of our equity on a fully diluted basis, based on the Determined Share Value. The increase in asset management fees during 2019, was primarily the result of an increase in our total outstanding equity on a fully diluted basis, which resulted from continued equity capital investments. As of December 31, 2019, there were 27.7 million shares of our common stock and OP Units outstanding, compared to 23.8 million as of December 31, 2018. The increase in equity capital was used to partially fund the continued growth in our real estate portfolio.\nProperty management fees\nWe paid our third-party manager a monthly fee equal to 3% of gross rentals collected from our real estate portfolio as compensation for its property management services. The increase in property management fees during the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily the result of growth in our portfolio as a result of additional property acquisitions and rent escalations.\nProperty and operating expense\nThe increase in property and operating expense was mainly attributable to the number of properties we own for which we are responsible for engaging a third-party manager to manage ongoing property maintenance, along with insurance and real estate taxes associated with those properties. We pay a majority of these expenses and are reimbursed by the tenants under the terms of the respective leases. There was a corresponding increase in operating expenses billed to tenants and included within Lease revenues.\nGeneral and administrative\nThe decrease in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019, was mainly attributable to a decrease in bad debt expense, which was approximately $1.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. As discussed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, prior to the adoption of ASC 842, provisions for doubtful accounts were recorded as bad debt expense and included in General and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Subsequent to the adoption of ASC 842 on January 1, 2019, provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded as an offset to Lease revenues, and totaled $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. As a result of the completion of the Internalization, our general and administrative expenses will include in the future direct employee compensation costs for 71 employees. In addition, our general and administrative expenses will include certain professional fees, consulting, portfolio servicing costs, and other general and administrative expenses not incurred under our previous externally managed structure. Given our current team and structure, we expect that as our portfolio grows, we will experience limited increases in general and administrative expenses in the next few years after 2020, as those expenses are expected to grow at a significantly slower rate than the overall portfolio and corresponding lease revenues.\nProvision for impairment of investment in rental properties\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized $3.5 million of impairment on our investments in rental properties. We review long-lived assets to be held and used for possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If and when such events or changes in circumstances are present, an impairment exists to the extent the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition. The impairments recognized during the year ended December 31, 2019, related to four properties whose carrying amounts we determined were not recoverable. In determining the fair value of the assets at the time of measurement, and depending on the specific property being evaluated, we utilized a capitalization rate of 14.6%, a weighted average discount rate of 8%, and a weighted average price per square foot of $226. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized $2.1 million of impairment on our investments in rental properties. The impairment related to five properties whose carrying amounts we determined were not recoverable. In determining the fair value of the assets at the time of measurement, and depending on the specific property being evaluated, we utilized capitalization rates ranging from 7.5% to 10%, and a weighted average discount rate of 8%.\nOther income (expenses)\n\nInterest expense\nThe increased interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2019, resulted primarily from an increase in average outstanding borrowings as compared to 2018, due primarily to the incurrence of indebtedness associated with the Industrial Portfolio Acquisition, partially offset by a 27 basis point decrease in our weighted average cost of debt, inclusive of our interest rate swaps. We were able to take advantage of the decreasing interest rates during the year, as our percentage of floating-rate debt increased concurrently with our funding of the Industrial Portfolio Acquisition. We also amended our 2024 Unsecured Term Loan in July 2019, to reduce the applicable margin from 1.90% to 1.25%.\nGain on sale of real estate\nOur recognition of a gain or loss on the sale of real estate varies from transaction to transaction based on fluctuations in asset prices and demand in the real estate market. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized gains of $29.9 million on the sale of 49 properties, compared to gains of $10.5 million on the sale of 20 properties during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nIncome taxes\nThe increase in income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2019, was mainly attributable to the U.S. federal and state taxes recognized on the gain on sale of certain properties held in our taxable REIT subsidiary during the fourth quarter of 2019, with no comparable activity during 2018.\nGain on sale of investment in related party\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold our investment of 100 non-voting convertible preferred units of BRE, a related party at such time, to Trident BRE LLC, another related party to BRE, for an aggregate sales price of $18.5 million. The preferred units had a carrying value of $10 million at the time of sale, resulting in a gain of $8.5 million. Prior to the sale, we received preferred distribution income on the preferred units.\nInternalization expenses\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred $3.7 million of third-party fees and consulting expenses associated with the Internalization.\nNet Income and Non-GAAP Measures (FFO and AFFO)\nOur reported results and net earnings per diluted share are presented in accordance with GAAP. We also disclose FFO and AFFO, each of which are non-GAAP measures. We believe the presentation of FFO and AFFO are useful to investors because they are widely accepted industry measures used by analysts and investors to compare the operating performance of REITs. FFO and AFFO should not be considered alternatives to net income as a performance measure or to cash flows from operations, as reported on our statement of cash flows, or as a liquidity measure, and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures.\nWe compute FFO in accordance with the standards established by the Board of Governors of Nareit, the worldwide representative voice for REITs and publicly traded real estate companies with an interest in the U.S. real estate and capital markets. Nareit defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude net gains (losses) from sales of certain depreciated real estate assets, depreciation and amortization expense from real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control, and impairment charges related to certain previously depreciated real estate assets. To derive AFFO, we modify the Nareit computation of FFO to include other adjustments to GAAP net income related to certain non-cash and non-recurring revenues and expenses, including straight-line rents, cost of debt extinguishments, amortization of lease intangibles, amortization of debt issuance costs, amortization of net mortgage premiums, (gain) loss on interest rate swaps and other non-cash interest expense, realized gains or losses on foreign currency transactions, internalization expenses, extraordinary items, and other specified non-cash items. We believe that such items are not a result of normal operations and thus we believe excluding such items assists management and investors in distinguishing whether changes in our operations are due to growth or decline of operations at our properties or from other factors.\nOur leases include cash rents that increase over the term of the lease to compensate us for anticipated increases in market rentals over time. Our leases do not include significant front-loading or back-loading of payments, or significant rent-free periods. Therefore, we find it useful to evaluate rent on a contractual basis as it allows for comparison of existing rental rates to market rental rates. We further exclude costs or gains recorded on the extinguishment of debt, non-cash interest expense and gains, the amortization of debt issuance costs, net mortgage premiums, and lease intangibles, realized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, and internalization expenses, as these items are not indicative of ongoing operational results. We use AFFO as a measure of our performance when we formulate corporate goals.\nFFO is used by management, investors, and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers, primarily because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions. We believe that AFFO is a useful supplemental measure for investors to consider because it will help them to better assess our operating performance without the distortions created by non-cash revenues or expenses. FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other REITs, and comparisons of our FFO and AFFO with the same or similar measures disclosed by other REITs may not be meaningful.\nNeither the SEC nor any other regulatory body has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments to FFO that we use to calculate AFFO. In the future, the SEC, Nareit or another regulatory body may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the REIT industry and in response to such standardization we may have to adjust our calculation and characterization of AFFO accordingly.\nThe following table presents our net income and our non-GAAP FFO and AFFO. Our measures of FFO and AFFO are computed on the basis of amounts attributable to both us and non-controlling interests. As the non-\ncontrolling interests share in our net income on a one-for-one basis, the basic and diluted per-share amounts are the same.\n\n (1) Weighted average number of shares of our common stock and OP Units outstanding ( WASO\u201d), computed in accordance with GAAP. \nNet income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, growth in net income was primarily attributable to revenue growth, as discussed in Results of Operations - Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018, combined with a $19.4 million increase in gains on sale of real estate. These factors were partially offset by a $24.8 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense associated with a larger real estate portfolio, a $19.7 million increase in interest expense associated with incremental borrowings used to partially fund our real estate acquisitions, and $3.7 million in internalization expenses incurred in 2019. We also recognized an $8.5 million gain on the sale of an investment in a related party during 2018, with no such activity in 2019.\nGAAP net income includes items such as gain or loss on sale of real estate and provisions for impairment, among others, which can vary from quarter to quarter and impact period-to-period comparisons. These fluctuations, coupled with our ongoing equity offering, resulted in a $0.12 decrease in net earnings per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nAFFO\nThe increase in AFFO during the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, was primarily driven by revenue growth in our real estate portfolio. This resulted from rent escalations associated with our same property portfolio, accretive acquisitions and strong portfolio operating performance.\nThe $0.14 increase in AFFO per diluted share was primarily the result of accretive acquisitions during the year, coupled with the positive per share impact of funding a larger portion of our acquisitions with lower costing debt compared to equity. We are committed to maintaining an investment grade balance sheet through active management of our leverage profile and overall liquidity position.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\nThe following is a reconciliation of net income to FFO and AFFO, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Also presented are the diluted WASO and per diluted share amounts:\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nWe acquire real estate using a combination of debt and equity capital and with cash from operations that is not otherwise distributed to our stockholders. Our focus is on maximizing the risk-adjusted return to our stockholders through an appropriate balance of debt and equity in our capital structure. We are committed to maintaining an investment grade balance sheet through active management of our leverage profile and overall liquidity position. We believe our leverage model has allowed us to take advantage of the lower cost of debt while simultaneously strengthening our balance sheet, as evidenced by our investment grade credit rating. As of December 31, 2019, our leverage ratio was 45.8% of the approximate market value of our assets, compared to 41.5% as of December 31, 2018. The increase was due to incremental borrowings associated with funding the Industrial Portfolio Acquisition during the third quarter of 2019. Following the Industrial Portfolio Acquisition, we have reduced our leverage profile using a combination of proceeds from our private offering of shares of our common stock and increasing disposition activity. As a result of our announcing the Industrial Portfolio Acquisition, Moody's affirmed our investment grade credit rating and stable outlook.\nLiquidity/REIT Requirements\nLiquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including our ongoing commitments to repay debt, fund our operations, acquire properties, make distributions to our stockholders, and other general business needs. As a REIT, we are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain, on an annual basis. As a result, it is unlikely that we will be able to retain substantial cash balances to meet our liquidity needs from our annual taxable income. Instead, we expect to meet our liquidity needs primarily by relying upon external sources of capital.\nShort-term Liquidity Requirements\nOur short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for our operating expenses, including our general and administrative expenses as well as interest payments on our outstanding debt and to pay distributions. Since our portfolio has a strong occupancy level and substantially all of our leases are net leases, we do not currently anticipate making significant capital expenditures or incurring other significant property costs. We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements primarily from cash and cash equivalents balances, net cash provided by operating activities, and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.\nLong-term Liquidity Requirements\nOur long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to repay debt and invest in additional revenue generating properties. Debt capital is provided through unsecured term notes, revolving debt facilities, and senior unsecured notes.\nThe source and mix of our debt capital in the future will be impacted by market conditions as well as our continued focus on lengthening our debt maturity profile to better align with our portfolio's lease terms, staggering debt maturities to reduce the risk that a significant amount of debt will mature in any single year in the future, and managing our exposure to interest rate risk.\nWe expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements primarily from borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility, future debt and equity financings, and proceeds from limited sales of our properties. Our ability to access these capital sources may be impacted by unfavorable market conditions, particularly in the debt and equity capital markets, that are outside of our control. In addition, our success will depend on our operating performance, our borrowing restrictions, our degree of leverage, and other factors. Our acquisition growth strategy significantly depends on our ability to obtain acquisition financing on favorable terms. We seek to reduce the risk that long-term debt capital may be unavailable to us by strengthening our balance sheet by investing in real estate with creditworthy tenants and lease guarantors, and by maintaining an appropriate mix of debt and equity capitalization. We also, from time to time, obtain or assume non-recourse mortgage financing from banks and insurance companies secured by mortgages on the corresponding specific property. Mortgages, however, are not currently a strategic focus of the active management of our leverage profile. Rather, we enter into mortgages and notes payable as ancillary business transactions on an as-needed basis, most often as the result of lease assumption transactions.\nEquity Capital Resources\nEquity capital for our real estate acquisition activity has historically been provided from the proceeds of our private offering, including distributions reinvested through our DRIP. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we raised $394.4 million in equity capital to be used in our acquisition activities, of which $329.8 million was received through new cash investments and $64.6 million was raised through our DRIP. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we raised $283.7 million in equity capital, of which $215.7 million was received through new cash investments, $52.2 million was raised through our DRIP, and $15.8 million was raised in exchange for OP Units through UPREIT transactions.\nCredit Rating\nWe achieved our current investment grade credit rating of Baa3 based on our conservative leverage profile, diversified real estate investment portfolio, access to capital, and earnings stability provided by the creditworthiness of our tenants. Factors that could negatively impact our credit rating include, but are not limited to: a significant increase in our leverage on a sustained basis, a significant increase in the proportion of secured debt levels, a significant decline in our unencumbered asset base, weakening of our corporate governance structure, and a significant decline in our real estate portfolio diversification or the creditworthiness of our tenants. Factors that could positively impact our credit rating include, but are not limited to, continued growth in the portfolio, improvement in our leverage profile, lengthening of our debt maturity profile, and our Internalization. We have aligned our strategic growth priorities with these factors, as we believe the favorable debt pricing and access to multiple sources of debt capital resulting from our investment grade credit rating provides us with an advantageous cost of capital and risk-adjusted return on investment for our stockholders.\nRecent Activity\nOn February 7, 2020, we entered into a $60 million term loan agreement maturing February 28, 2022 (the 2022 Unsecured Term Loan\u201d) with JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent. The 2022 Unsecured Term Loan was fully funded at closing and used to partially repay BRE debt that had been assumed by the Company as part of the Internalization. Borrowings under the 2022 Unsecured Term Loan are subject to interest only payments at variable rates equal to LIBOR plus a margin based on our credit rating, ranging between 0.85% and 1.65% per annum. Based on our current credit rating, the applicable margin is 1.25%.\nExisting Credit Facilities\nThe following table sets forth our outstanding Revolving Credit Facility, unsecured term loans and Senior Notes as of December 31, 2019.\n\nRevolving Credit Facility\nThe Revolving Credit Facility has a maximum availability of $600 million, and includes a $35 million sublimit for swingline loans and $20 million available for issuance of letters of credit. The Revolving Credit Facility has an initial maturity date of January 2022 and provides for one five-month extension, at our election, subject to certain conditions set forth in the agreement and payment of a 0.0625% fee on the revolving commitments. The Revolving Credit Facility contains an applicable facility fee ranging between 0.125% and 0.30% per annum, based on our credit rating. Based on our current credit rating of Baa3, the facility fee is 0.25% per annum as of December 31, 2019.\nBorrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at variable rates based on LIBOR plus a margin based on our credit rating ranging between 0.825% and 1.55% per annum. Based on our current credit rating, the applicable margin is 1.20% as of December 31, 2019.\n2020 Unsecured Term Loan\nThe 2020 Unsecured Term loan has an initial maturity date of August 2020. Borrowings under the 2020 Unsecured Term Loan bear interest at variable rates based on LIBOR plus a margin based on our credit rating ranging between 0.85% and 1.65% per annum. Based on our current credit rating, the applicable margin is 1.25% as of December 31, 2019.\n2023 Unsecured Term Loan\nThe 2023 Unsecured Term loan has an initial maturity date of January 2023. Borrowings under the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan bear interest at variable rates based on LIBOR plus a margin based on our credit rating ranging between 0.90% and 1.75% per annum. Based on our current credit rating, the applicable margin is 1.35% as of December 31, 2019.\n2024 Unsecured Term Loan\nThe 2024 Unsecured Term Loan has an initial maturity date of June 2024. Borrowings under the 2024 Unsecured Term Loan are subject to interest at variable rates based on LIBOR plus a margin based on our credit rating ranging between 0.85% and 1.65% per annum. Based on our current credit rating, the applicable margin is 1.25% as of December 31, 2019.\n2026 Unsecured Term Loan\nThe 2026 Unsecured Term Loan includes an accordion feature that provides for an increase in the facility size up to a total of $550 million of available capacity. Borrowings under the 2026 Unsecured Term Loan are payable interest only on a monthly basis during the term of the loan, with the principal amount due in February 2026. Borrowings under the 2026 Unsecured Term loan bear interest equal to LIBOR plus a margin based on our credit rating ranging between 1.45% and 2.40% per annum. Based on our current grade credit rating, the applicable margin is 1.85% as of December 31, 2019.\nSenior Notes\nTo mitigate interest rate risk, we have strategically added unsecured, fixed-rate, interest-only senior promissory notes ( Senior Notes\u201d) to our capital structure. The Senior Notes were issued in three series (Series A, B, and C) as described below.\nSeries A Notes\nThe Series A Notes are payable interest only semiannually during their term, bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.84% per annum, and mature on April 18, 2027.\nSeries B and Series C Notes\nThe Series B Notes mature on July 2, 2028, and the Series C Notes mature on July 2, 2030. The Series B and Series C Notes are payable interest only semiannually during their term, and bear interest at fixed rates of 5.09% per annum and 5.19% per annum, respectively.\nDebt Covenants\nWe are subject to various covenants and financial reporting requirements pursuant to our debt facilities. The table below summarizes the applicable financial covenants, which are substantially the same across each of our debt facilities. As of December 31, 2019, we believe that we were in compliance with all of our covenants. In the event of default, either through default on payments or breach of covenants, we may be restricted from paying dividends to our stockholders in excess of dividends required to maintain our REIT qualification. For each of the previous three years, we paid dividends out of our cash flows from operations in excess of the distribution amounts required to maintain our REIT qualification.\n\n (1) The leverage ratio is calculated as the ratio of total indebtedness to total market value. For debt covenant purposes, total market value is computed on a consolidated basis as the net operating income for the most recently completed fiscal quarter on properties owned for four consecutive quarters at a capitalization rate of 7.50%, multiplied by four, plus the acquisition price of properties acquired in the last four quarters, and the GAAP book value of mortgages receivable, development property, unimproved real estate, unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, and all other tangible assets (the latter subject to a cap of 5% of total market value). For purposes of determining total market value, net operating income from properties disposed of during the immediately preceding period of four consecutive fiscal quarters are excluded. \n (2) The secured indebtedness ratio is the ratio of secured indebtedness to total market value. Secured indebtedness represents outstanding mortgage borrowings. \n (3) The unencumbered coverage ratio is the ratio of net operating income for all eligible properties to unsecured interest expense for the most recent fiscal quarter. \n (4) The fixed charge coverage ratio is the ratio of adjusted EBITDA to fixed charges for the most recent fiscal quarter. Adjusted EBITDA is computed as net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization, interest expense, income tax expense and franchise tax expense, gains and losses from the sale of properties, equity in net income of unconsolidated subsidiaries, non-cash expenses related to mark to market exposure under derivatives contracts, straight-line rent adjustments, amortization of intangibles, gains and losses on early extinguishment of debt, non-cash severance and restructuring charges, transaction costs expensed, and reserves for replacements with respect to certain properties. Fixed charges are computed as interest expense, plus scheduled principal repayments of debt, excluding balloon payments if applicable, plus preferred dividends paid or accrued, if applicable. \n (5) The ratio is calculated as the ratio of total unsecured indebtedness to unencumbered property value. \nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk arising from changes in interest rates on the floating-rate borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities and a certain mortgage. Borrowings pursuant to our unsecured credit facilities and the mortgage bear interest at floating rates based on LIBOR plus an applicable margin. Accordingly, fluctuations in market interest rates may increase or decrease our interest expense, which will in turn, increase or decrease our net income and cash flow.\nWe attempt to manage our interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swaps. As of December 31, 2019, we had 34 interest rate swaps outstanding in an aggregate notional amount of $909.9 million. Under these agreements, we receive monthly payments from the counterparties equal to the related variable interest rates multiplied by the outstanding notional amounts. In turn, we pay the counterparties each month an amount equal to a fixed interest rate multiplied by the related outstanding notional amounts. The intended net impact of these transactions is that we pay a fixed interest rate on our variable-rate borrowings. The interest rate swaps have been designated by us as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes and are reported at fair value. We assess, both at inception and on an ongoing basis, the effectiveness of our qualifying cash flow hedges. We have not entered, and do not intend to enter, into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes.\nCash Flows\nCash and cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled $20.3 million, $19.0 million, and $10.1 million at December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The table below shows information concerning cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017:\n\nThe increase in net cash provided by operating activities during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, as compared to the comparable prior periods, was mainly due to growth in our real estate portfolio.\nThe increase in net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, reflected increased outflows for the acquisition of properties, most notably the Industrial Portfolio Acquisition. In addition, during the 2018 period, we received $18.5 million from the sale of our investment in preferred units of BRE, with no such cash inflow in 2019. These factors were somewhat offset by increased proceeds from the disposal of properties as we actively manage our balance sheet following the Industrial Portfolio Acquisition. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, mainly reflected lower outflows for the acquisition of properties, combined with the cash received on the sale of the preferred units of BRE.\nThe increase in net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, mainly reflects net incremental borrowings and increased proceeds from the issuance of our common stock, which were used to fund the increased acquisition activity, partially offset by increased distributions resulting from an increase in the number of shares of common stock outstanding. The decrease in net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, mainly reflected lower net borrowings due to lower acquisition volume, combined with lower proceeds from the sale of common stock reflective of the equity cap and queue program that we instituted in November 2017 to better match fund inflows from equity investments with outflows for acquisitions.\nImpact of Inflation\nThe leases in our portfolio are long-term in nature, with a current ABR weighted average remaining lease term of 11.5 years as of December 31, 2019. Our rental revenues may be impacted by inflation. Substantially all of our leases have contractual lease escalations, with an ABR weighted average of 2.1% as of December 31, 2019. Many of our leases contain rent escalators that increase rent at a fixed amount and may not be sufficient during periods of high inflation. Leases that contributed approximately 15.9% of our ABR as of December 31, 2019, contained rent escalators based on increases in CPI and the associated increases in rental revenue may be limited during periods of low inflation. The impact of inflation on our property and operating expenses is limited since substantially all of our leases are net leases, and property-level expenses are generally paid by our tenants. To the extent we bear the cost of such expense, we attempt to limit our exposure to inflation through the use of warranties and other remedies that reduce the likelihood of a significant capital outlay. Inflation and increased costs may also have an adverse impact to our tenants and their creditworthiness if the increase in property-level expenses is greater than their increase in revenues.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2019, or December 31, 2018.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table provides information with respect to our contractual commitments and obligations as of December 31, 2019 (in thousands).\n\n (1) We may extend the 2020 Unsecured Term Loan twice, each time for a six-month period, subject to certain conditions, including the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.05% of the aggregate principal amount of loans outstanding. \n (2) We may extend the Revolving Credit Facility once, for a five-month period, subject to certain conditions, including the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.0625% of the revolving commitments. \n (3) Interest expense is projected based on the outstanding borrowings and interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2019. This amount includes the impact of interest rate swap agreements. \n (4) We expect to pay tenant improvement allowances out of cash flows from operations or from additional borrowings. \nAt December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, investment in rental property of $178.7 million and $139.8 million, respectively, was pledged as collateral against our mortgages and notes payable.\nAdditionally, we are a party to three separate tax protection agreements with the contributing members of three distinct UPREIT transactions and we entered into the Founding Owners' Tax Protection Agreement with the Founding Owners in connection with the Internalization. The tax protection agreements require us to indemnify the beneficiaries in the event of a sale, exchange, transfer, or other disposal of the contributed property, or in the case of the Founding Owners' Tax Protection Agreement, the entire Company, in a taxable transaction that would cause such beneficiaries to recognize a gain that is protected under the agreements, subject to certain exceptions. Based on values as of December 31, 2019, taxable sales would trigger liability under the four tax protection agreements of approximately $22.3 million. Based on information available, we do not believe that the events resulting in damages as detailed above have occurred or are likely to occur in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, we have excluded these commitments from the contractual commitments table above.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses as well as other disclosures in the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and assumptions; however, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions, which in turn could have a material impact on our financial statements. A summary of our significant accounting policies and procedures are included in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d, contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nInvestments in Rental Property\nWe record investments in rental property accounted for under operating leases at cost. We record investments in rental property accounted for under direct financing leases at their net investment (which at the inception of the lease generally represents the cost of the property).\nWe early adopted ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business ( ASU 2017-01\u201d), on a prospective basis, effective January 1, 2017. The guidance changes the definition of a business to exclude acquisitions where substantially all of the fair value of the assets acquired are concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets, and therefore are accounted for as asset acquisitions instead of business combinations. All of our acquisitions of real estate closed subsequent to adopting ASU 2017-01 are accounted for as asset acquisitions.\nWe allocate the purchase price of investments in rental property accounted for as asset acquisitions based on the relative fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. These generally include tangible assets, consisting of land and land improvements, buildings and other improvements, and equipment, and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities, including the value of in-place leases and acquired above-market and below-market leases. Acquisition costs incurred in connection with investments in real estate accounted for as asset acquisitions are capitalized and included with the allocated purchase price. The results of operations of acquired properties are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income from the respective date of acquisition.\nWe allocate the purchase price of investments in rental property accounted for as a business combination based on the estimated fair value at the date of the acquisition of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. These generally include tangible assets, consisting of land and land improvements, buildings and other improvements, and equipment, and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities, including the value of in-place leases and acquired above-market and below-market leases. Acquisition costs incurred in connection with investments in real estate accounted for as business combinations are expensed at the time of acquisition. The results of operations of acquired properties are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income from the respective date of acquisition.\nWe use multiple sources to estimate fair value, including information obtained about each property as a result of our pre-acquisition due diligence and our marketing and leasing activities. Factors that impact our fair value determination include real estate market conditions, industry conditions that the tenant operates in, and characteristics of the real estate and/or real estate appraisals. Changes in any of these factors could impact the future purchase prices of our investments and the corresponding capitalization rates recognized. We do not believe the assumptions used to fair value the investments upon acquisition have a significant degree of estimation uncertainty.\nWe determine the fair value of tangible assets of an acquired property by valuing the property as if it were vacant. Management then allocates the as-if-vacant value to land and land improvements, buildings, and equipment based on comparable sales and other relevant information with respect to the property, as estimated by management. Specifically, the if vacant\u201d value of buildings and equipment is calculated using an income approach. Assumptions used in the income approach to value buildings include: capitalization and discount rates, lease-up time, market rents, make ready costs, land value, and land improvement value.\nThe estimated fair value of acquired in-place leases equals the costs we would have had to incur to lease the properties to the occupancy level of the properties at the date of acquisition. Such costs include the fair value of leasing commissions and other operating costs that would have been incurred to lease the properties, had they been vacant, to their acquired occupancy level. We amortize acquired in-place leases as of the date of acquisition over the remaining initial non-cancellable terms of the respective leases to amortization expense.\nWe record acquired above-market and below-market lease values based on the present value (using an interest rate that reflects the risks associated with the lease acquired) of the differences between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and management's estimate of fair market value lease rates at the time of acquisition for the corresponding in-place leases. We amortize the capitalized above-market and below-market lease values as adjustments to rental revenue over the remaining term of the respective leases.\nShould a tenant terminate its lease, we charge the unamortized portion of the in-place lease value to amortization expense and we charge the unamortized portion of above-market or below-market lease value to rental income.\nManagement estimates the fair value of assumed mortgages and notes payable based upon indications of then-current market pricing for similar types of debt with similar maturities. We record assumed mortgages and notes payable at their estimated fair value as of the assumption date, and the difference between the estimated fair value and the notes' outstanding principal balance is amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the debt.\nLong-lived Asset Impairment\nWe review long-lived assets to be held and used for possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If, and when, such events or changes in circumstances are present, an impairment exists to the extent the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition. Such cash flows include expected future operating income, as adjusted for trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition, and other factors. An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group. A significant judgment is made as to if and when impairment should be taken. If our strategy, or one or more of the assumptions described above were to change in the future, an impairment may need to be recognized.\nInputs used in establishing fair value for real estate assets generally fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, which are characterized as requiring significant judgment as little or no current market activity may be available for validation. The main indicator used to establish the classification of the inputs is current market conditions, as derived through our use of published commercial real estate market information. We determine the valuation of impaired assets using generally accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis, income capitalization, analysis of recent comparable sales transactions, actual sales negotiations, and bona fide purchase offers received from third parties. We may consider a single valuation technique or multiple valuation techniques, as appropriate, when estimating the fair value of real estate.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, we recorded impairment charges of $3.5 million, $2.1 million, and $2.6 million, respectively. Impairment indicators were identified due to concerns over each tenant's future viability, property vacancies, and changes to the overall investment strategy for the real estate assets. In determining the fair value of the real estate assets at the time of measurement, and depending on the property being evaluated, we utilized capitalization rates ranging from 7.25% to 12.0%, a weighted average discount rate of 8.0%, and a weighted average price per square foot of $226, which are Level 3 inputs. We believe the uncertainty in the future cash flows was reflected in the significant capitalization rate, and the estimates were based on the information available at the time of impairment. The properties for which an impairment charge was recorded in 2018 were subsequently sold in 2019. One of the properties for which an impairment charge was recorded in 2017 was subsequently sold in 2018. The assumptions we used in determining the amount of the impairment charges on these properties were validated upon the subsequent sales, which were at values consistent with our originally estimated impaired values. We classified the impairment charge within earnings from operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company commences revenue recognition on its leases based on a number of factors, including the initial determination that the contract is or contains a lease. Generally, all of the Company's property related contracts are or contain leases, and therefore revenue is recognized when the lessee takes possession of or controls the physical use of the leased assets. In most instances this occurs on the lease commencement date. At the time of lease assumption or at the inception of a new lease, including new leases that arise from amendments, the Company assesses the terms and conditions of the lease to determine the proper lease classification.\nCertain of the Company's leases require tenants to pay rent based upon a percentage of the property's net sales ( percentage rent\u201d) or contain rent escalators indexed to future changes in the CPI. Lease income associated with such provisions is considered variable lease income and therefore is not included in the initial measurement of the lease receivable, or in the calculation of straight-line rent revenue. Such amounts are recognized as income when the amounts are determinable.\nAs described in Recently Adopted Accounting Standards in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) and related ASUs subsequently issued (collectively, ASC 842\u201d) as of January 1, 2019.\nLeases Executed on or After Adoption of ASC 842\nA lease is classified as an operating lease if none of the following criteria are met: (i) ownership transfers to the lessee at the end of the lease term, (ii) the lessee has a purchase option that is reasonably expected to be exercised, (iii) the lease term is for a major part of the economic life of the leased property, (iv) the present value of the future lease payments and any residual value guaranteed by the lessee that is not already reflected in the lease payments equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the leased property, and (v) the leased property is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no future alternative use to the Company at the end of the lease term. If one or more of these criteria are met, the lease will generally be classified as a sales-type lease, unless the lease contains a residual value guarantee from a third party other than the lessee, in which case it would be classified as a direct financing lease under certain circumstances in accordance with ASC 842.\nASC 842 requires the Company to account for the right to use land as a separate lease component, unless the accounting effect of doing so would be insignificant. Determination of significance requires management judgment. In determining whether the accounting effect of separately reporting the land component from other components for its real estate leases is significant, the Company assesses: (i) whether separating the land component impacts the classification of any lease component, (ii) the value of the land component in the context of the overall contract, and (iii) whether the right to use the land is coterminous with the rights to use the other assets.\nLeases Executed Prior to Adoption of ASC 842\nA lease arrangement was classified as an operating lease if none of the following criteria were met: (i) ownership transferred to the lessee prior to or shortly after the end of the lease term, (ii) the lessee had a bargain purchase option during or at the end of the lease term, (iii) the lease term was greater than or equal to 75% of the underlying property's estimated useful life, or (iv) the present value of the future minimum lease payments (excluding executory costs) was greater than or equal to 90% of the fair value of the leased property. If one or more of these criteria were met, and the minimum lease payments were determined to be reasonably predictable and collectible, the lease arrangement was generally accounted for as a direct financing lease. Consistent with ASC 840, Leases, if the fair value of the land component was 25% or more of the total fair value of the leased property, the land was considered separately from the building for purposes of applying the lease term and minimum lease payments criterion in (iii) and (iv) above.\nRevenue recognition methods for operating leases, direct financing leases, and sales-type leases are described below:\nRental property accounted for under operating leases - Revenue is recognized as rents are earned on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable terms of the related leases. For leases that have fixed and measurable rent escalations, the difference between such rental income earned and the cash rent due under the provisions of the lease is recorded as Accrued rental income on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nRental property accounted for under direct financing leases - The Company utilizes the direct finance method of accounting to record direct financing lease income. The net investment in the direct financing lease represents receivables for the sum of future lease payments to be received and the estimated residual value of the leased property, less unamortized unearned income (which represents the difference between undiscounted cash flows and discounted cash flows). Unearned income is deferred and amortized into income over the lease terms so as to produce a constant periodic rate of return on the Company's net investment in the leases.\nRental property accounted for under sales-type leases - For leases accounted for as sales-type leases, the Company records selling profit arising from the lease at inception, along with the net investment in the lease. The Company leases assets through the assumption of existing leases or through sale-leaseback transactions, and records such assets at their fair value at the time of acquisition, which in most cases coincides with lease inception. As a result, the Company does not generally recognize selling profit on sales-type leases. The net investment in the sales-type lease represents receivables for the sum of future lease payments and the estimated unguaranteed residual value of the leased property, each measured at net present value. Interest income is recorded over the lease terms so as to produce a constant periodic rate of return on the Company's net investment in the leases.\nCertain of the Company's contracts contain nonlease components (e.g., charges for management fees, common area maintenance, and reimbursement of third-party maintenance expenses) in addition to lease components (i.e., monthly rental charges). Services related to nonlease components are provided over the same period of time as, and billed in the same manner as, monthly rental charges. The Company elected to apply the practical expedient available under ASC 842, for all classes of assets, not to separate the lease components from the nonlease components when accounting for operating leases. Since the lease component is the predominant component under each of these leases, combined revenues from both the lease and nonlease components are reported as Lease revenues in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\nManagement uses interest rate swap agreements to manage risks related to interest rate movements on our variable-rate debt. The interest rate swap agreements, designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges, are reported at fair value. We adopted ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting and Hedging Activities, effective January 1, 2018 on a modified retrospective basis. ASU 2017-12 amended the designation and measurement guidance for qualifying hedging transactions and the presentation of hedge results in an entity's financial statements.\nPrior to the adoption of ASU 2017-12, the gain or loss on the effective portion of the hedge was initially included as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and was subsequently reclassified into earnings when interest payments on the related debt were incurred and as the swap net settlements occurred. If and when there was ineffectiveness realized on a swap agreement, the Company recognized the ineffectiveness as a component of interest expense in the period incurred.\nASU 2017-12 removed the concept of separately measuring and reporting hedge ineffectiveness and requires a company to present the earnings effect of the hedging instrument in the same income statement line item in which the earnings effect of the hedged item is reported. In accordance with ASU 2017-12, the gain or loss on the qualifying hedges is initially included as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and is subsequently reclassified into earnings when interest payments (the forecasted transactions) on the related debt are incurred and as the swap net settlements occur.\nWhen an existing cash flow hedge is terminated, we determine the accounting treatment for the accumulated gain or loss recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, based on the probability of the hedged forecasted transaction occurring within the period the cash flow hedge was anticipated to affect earnings. If management determines that the hedged forecasted transaction is probable of occurring during the original period, the accumulated gain or loss is reclassified into earnings over the remaining life of the cash flow hedge using a straight-line method, which approximates an effective interest method. If management determines that the hedged forecasted transaction is not probable of occurring during the original period, the entire amount of accumulated gain or loss is reclassified into earnings in the period the cash flow hedge is terminated.\nManagement documents its risk management strategy and hedge effectiveness at the inception of and during the term of each hedge. Our interest rate risk management strategy is intended to stabilize cash flow requirements by maintaining interest rate swap agreements to convert certain variable-rate debt to a fixed rate.\nImpact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information on the impact of recent accounting pronouncements on our business, see the captions Recently Adopted Accounting Standards and Other Recently Issued Accounting Standards in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.

Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) from an Annual Report on Form 10-K, detailing the financial and operational state of a real estate investment trust (REIT) company that specializes in acquiring, owning, and managing single-tenant commercial real estate properties. The following summary captures the key points of the report:\n\n**Overview:**\n- The company focuses on properties net leased to a diverse group of tenants across various industries.\n- Since its inception in 2007, the company has grown to 645 properties in 41 U.S. states and one in Canada as of December 31, 2019.\n- Revenue is primarily derived from rent, with most leases having initial terms of 10 years or more and renewal options, 98.4% of which include periodic rent escalations.\n- The tenant base is diversified across 54 industries, with no single tenant accounting for more than 2.8% of the company's annual base rent (ABR).\n\n**Internalization:**\n- The company internalized its management structure, effective February 7, 2020, transitioning from external to internal management and incurring certain additional expenses.\n\n**Factors Affecting Financial Conditions and Operations:**\n- Key factors include rental rates, lease renewals, occupancy, acquisition volumes, financing arrangements, leverage, property dispositions, general and administrative expenses, inflation, and tenant bankruptcies.\n\n**Rental Rates:**\n- Most leases include provisions for escalating rent to accommodate inflation.\n\n**Property Dispositions:**\n- The company strategically sells properties that no longer align with its risk-adjusted return objectives.\n\n**Lease Renewals and Occupancy:**\n- The stability of rental revenue is based on tenants' ability to pay rent and the company's success in renewing leases, re-leasing properties, and maintaining occupancy.\n\n**Acquisition Volume:**\n- The company's growth has involved property acquisitions, which depend on favorable market conditions and access to financing.\n\n**Net Lease Terms:**\n- Tenants typically cover all property expenses, with certain leases requiring the company to cover some costs.\n- Master lease structures are utilized when appropriate.\n\n**Interest Expense:**\n- Future acquisitions and changes in interest rate environments might affect interest expenses.\n\n**Property Management and Asset Management Fees:**\n- After internalization, the company no longer pays these fees.\n\n**General and Administrative Expenses:**\n- Expenses are expected to grow slower than the portfolio and corresponding lease revenues.\n\n**Impact of Inflation:**\n- Rental revenues could be affected by inflation, but many leases have fixed escalation clauses.\n\n**Tenant Bankruptcies:**\n- Tenant bankruptcies could impact the ability to collect rent and maintain occupancy.\n\n**Results of Operations:**\n- A detailed comparison of lease revenues and operating expenses is provided, including year-over-year changes in net income, FFO (funds from operations), and AFFO (adjusted funds from operations).\n- In 2019, there were acquisitions, high rent collection, and strong occupancy, contributing to revenue growth.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources:**\n- The company's capital comes from a mix of debt and equity, maintaining an investment grade balance sheet.\n- Liquidity requirements are met through external capital, operating cash flows, and borrowing.\n- The company has several credit facilities, term loans, and senior notes detailed in the report.\n\n**Critical Accounting Policies:**\n- The report outlines policies regarding the valuation of acquired properties, impairment of long-lived assets, revenue recognition, and hedging activities.\n\n**Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements:**\n- The report notes the adoption of new accounting standards, including ASC 842 related to leases, which have impacted financial reporting.\n\n**Contractual Commitments:**\n- Obligations regarding term loans, credit facilities, interest expenses, tenant improvements, and operating leases are itemized by maturity year.\n\nThe MD&A in the 10-K is intended to supplement the company's consolidated financial statements, providing readers with a deeper understanding of the company's financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. It includes detailed tables and figures to support the narrative analysis."}
