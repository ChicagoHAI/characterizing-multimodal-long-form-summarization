Our current areas of focus are in the DJ Basin in Colorado and the Delaware Basin in Texas. We currently provide crude oil, natural gas, and water-related midstream services through long-term, fixed-fee contracts. Our business activities are conducted through three reportable segments: Gathering Systems (crude oil, natural gas and produced water gathering as well as crude oil treating), Fresh Water Delivery, and Investments and Other. We often refer to the services of our Gathering Systems and Fresh Water Delivery reportable segments collectively as our midstream services.\nWe are Noble's primary vehicle for its midstream operations in the onshore United States. We believe that our diverse midstream infrastructure assets and our relationship with Noble position us as a leading midstream service provider.\nSignificant Results\nThe following discussion highlights significant operating, transactional and financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nSignificant Operational Highlights Included:\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>average crude oil gathering volumes of 65.7 MBbl/d;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>average natural gas gathering volumes of 180.9 BBtu/d;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>average produced water gathering volumes of 24.4 MBbl/d;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>average fresh water delivery volumes of 156.0 MBbl/d;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>completion of a produced water expansion project in the Wells Ranch CGF;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>completion of construction and commencement of crude oil gathering, produced water gathering and fresh water delivery services to an unaffiliated third party in the Greeley Crescent IDP;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>completion of construction of the Billy Miner I and Jesse James CGFs in the Delaware Basin;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>commencement of crude oil, natural gas and produced water gathering services in the Delaware Basin;

We will evaluate the level of capital spending throughout the year based on the following factors, among others, and their effect on project financial returns:\nTable 198: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>pace of our customers' development;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 199: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>operating and construction costs and our ability to achieve material supplier price reductions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>impact of new laws and regulations on our business practices;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 201: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>indebtedness levels; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 202: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>availability of financing or other sources of funding.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We plan to fund our investment program with cash on hand, from cash generated from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and, if necessary, the issuance of additional equity or debt securities.\nDedication and ROFR Update\nOn April 24, 2017, Noble completed the acquisition of Clayton Williams Energy, Inc. Upon closing of the acquisition, approximately 64,000 net acres in the Delaware Basin were dedicated to us for infield crude oil, natural gas, and produced water gathering. We have a ROFR on the remaining acreage acquired by Noble. Additionally, an infield natural gas gathering dedication was added to the existing crude oil and produced water gathering dedication on substantially all of Noble's legacy 47,000 Delaware Basin net acres. Both acreage dedications are held by the Blanco River DevCo.\nIn conjunction with the new dedications, we waived our ROFR for natural gas processing on approximately 80,000 net acres in the Delaware Basin, of which, approximately 35,000 net acres were dedicated to a third party through 2021.\nDevelopment Project Updates\nLaramie River DevCo LP During the second quarter of 2017, we commenced Fresh water deliveries to an unaffiliated third party in the Greeley Crescent IDP. We also began gathering crude oil and produced water for this customer in the third quarter of 2017. Additionally, we connected 90 equivalent wells, normalized to 4,500 lateral feet, to our system during 2017.\nBlanco River DevCo LP We began construction of the Billy Miner I and the Jesse James CGFs. During the third quarter of 2017, we placed the Billy Miner I CGF in service. As a result of the strong well performance and plans for additional wells to be tied into the facility, we completed a debottlenecking project with minor facility modifications in late August, increasing crude oil, natural gas and produced water throughput capacity to 15 MBbl/d, 30 MMcf/d, and 30 MBw/d, respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2017, our second CGF, Jesse James, was placed in service. The Jesse James CGF currently has crude oil, natural gas and produced water throughput capacity of 15 MBbl/d, 30 MMcf/d, and 30 MBw/d, respectively. We connected 29 equivalent wells to our gathering systems during 2017. Additionally, we also completed backbone gathering infrastructure on the Southern portion of Noble Energy's Delaware Basin Acreage. Construction is underway on three additional CGFs which are scheduled to be online by the first half of 2018.\nTrinity River DevCo LLC We completed construction of the 15-mile connection from our CGFs in the Delaware Basin to the Advantage pipeline. Crude oil from the Billy Miner I and Jesse James CGFs began flowing through the connection to the Advantage Pipeline.\nColorado River DevCo LP During 2017, we connected 189 equivalent wells, to our gathering systems in the Wells Ranch IDP and East Pony IDP. We also delivered fresh water to 110 equivalent wells in the Wells Ranch IDP. At the Wells Ranch CGF, we successfully completed a produced water expansion project, which increased produced water capacity to 30 MBbl/d.\nGreen River DevCo LP During 2017, we began construction activities on the expansion of our freshwater system in the Mustang IDP. The freshwater expansion commenced operations in December 2017. Additionally, construction is underway on the backbone gathering infrastructure buildout, which we expect to complete in early 2018.\nSan Juan River DevCo LP During 2017, we delivered freshwater to 88 equivalent wells in the East Pony IDP.\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nOur management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics, each as described in more detail below, to analyze our performance. These metrics are significant factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include:\nTable 203: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>throughput volumes (Gathering Systems and Fresh Water Delivery reportable segments);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 204: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>operating costs and expenses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 205: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP financial measure);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 206: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>distributable cash flow (non-GAAP financial measure);

These volumes are affected primarily by the level of drilling and completion activity by our customers in our areas of operations, and by changes in the supply of and demand for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs in the markets served directly or indirectly by our assets.\nOur customers' willingness to engage in drilling and completion activity is determined by a number of factors, the most important of which are the prevailing and projected prices of crude oil and natural gas, the cost to drill and operate a well, expected well performance, the availability and cost of capital, and environmental and government regulations. We generally expect the level of drilling to positively correlate with long-term trends in commodity prices. Similarly, production levels nationally and regionally generally tend to positively correlate with drilling activity.\nOur customers have dedicated acreage to us based on the services we provide. Our commercial agreements with Noble provide that, in addition to our existing dedicated acreage, any future acreage that is acquired by Noble in the IDP areas, and that is not subject to a pre-existing third-party commitment, will be included in the dedication to us for midstream services, including gathering and treating.\nRevenues and throughput volumes related to certain midstream services of our Gathering Systems and Fresh Water Delivery reportable segments were as follows: Table 210: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Colorado River DevCo LP (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Crude Oil Gathering Volumes (Bbl/d)\n</td> <td>56,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural Gas Gathering Volumes (MMBtu/d)\n</td> <td>172,284\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>132,147\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Produced Water Gathering Volumes (Bbl/d)\n</td> <td>14,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,592\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fresh Water Delivery Volumes (Bbl/d)\n</td> <td>83,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,746\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gathering and Fresh Water Delivery Revenues -

Direct labor costs, ad valorem taxes, repair and maintenance costs, integrity management costs, utilities and contract services comprise the most significant portion of our operations and maintenance expense. Many of these expenses remain relatively stable across broad ranges of throughput volumes, but a portion of these expenses can fluctuate from period to period depending on the mix of activities performed during that period and the timing of these expenses. We also seek to manage operating expenditures on our midstream systems by scheduling maintenance over time to avoid significant variability in our maintenance expenditures and minimize their impact on our cash flow.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nFollowing the completion of the IPO, Noble charges us a combination of direct and allocated charges for general and administrative services. Direct charges include a fixed fee under our omnibus agreement and compensation of our executives under our secondment agreement based on the percentage of time spent working on us. Between January 2015 and the IPO date, Noble charged us a fixed fee for overhead and support services.\nWe incur incremental general and administrative expenses attributable to being a publicly traded partnership, including expenses associated with: annual, quarterly and current reporting with the SEC; tax return and Schedule K-1 preparation and distribution; Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 compliance; NYSE listing; independent auditor fees; legal fees; investor relations expenses; transfer agent and registrar fees; incremental salary and benefits costs of seconded employees; outside director fees; director and officer insurance coverage expenses; and compensation expense associated with the LTIP.\nCosts and Expenses Trend Analysis\nCosts and expenses were as follows: Table 228: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\nfrom Prior Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\nfrom Prior Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs and Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct Operating\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and Amortization\n</td> <td>12,953\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,891\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and Administrative\n</td> <td>13,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>258\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Operating Expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,087\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDirect Operating Expenses Direct operating expenses increased during 2017 as compared with 2016 and increased during 2016 as compared with 2015. The increases in direct operating expenses by reportable segment were as follows:\nGathering Systems Gathering Systems direct operating expenses increased $22.7 million during 2017 as compared with 2016 and increased $0.6 million during 2016 as compared with 2015. The increase in both years was primarily attributable to an increase in gathering systems and facilities operating expense associated with higher gathered volumes, general repairs and maintenance of our gathering systems and facilities, and produced water services expense resulting from services provided by third parties. In 2016, the increase in Gathering Systems direct operating expenses was partially offset by a decrease in crude oil treating expense due to a reduction in quantities treated in our facilities.\nFresh Water Delivery Fresh Water Delivery direct operating expenses increased $1.6 million during 2017 as compared with 2016 primarily due to an increase in water delivery and services expense driven by an increase in fresh water volumes required per well for higher intensity completions. Fresh Water Delivery direct operating expenses increased $11.8 million during 2016 as compared with 2015 primarily due to an increase in water delivery and services expense driven by an increase in fresh water volumes required per well for higher intensity completions and an expanded scope of services delivered.\nInvestments and Other Investments and Other direct operating expenses increased $0.6 million during 2017 as compared with 2016 due to increased insurance expense. Investments and Other direct operating expenses decreased $0.3 million during 2016 as compared with 2015 primarily due to decreased insurance expense. Prior to the IPO, insurance expense was allocated from Noble to our Predecessor.\nDepreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense increased during 2017 as compared with 2016 and increased during 2016 as compared with 2015. The increases in direct operating expenses by reportable segment were as follows:\nGathering Systems Gathering Systems depreciation and amortization expense increased $3.3 million during 2017 as compared with 2016 primarily due to assets placed in service in 2017. Assets placed in service were associated with the expansion of the Wells Ranch CGF and gathering system, construction of the Greeley Crescent gathering system, construction of the Delaware Basin gathering system, and completion of the Jesse James and Billy Miner I CGFs. Gathering Systems depreciation and amortization expense increased $2.1 million during 2016 as compared with 2015 primarily due to assets placed in service as a result of the expansion of the Wells Ranch CGF and commissioning of the East Pony crude oil gathering system during 2016 and the expansion of the Wells Ranch gathering system at the end of third quarter 2015.\nFresh Water Delivery Fresh Water Delivery depreciation and amortization expense increased $0.6 million during 2017 as compared with 2016 primarily due to assets placed in service in 2017. Assets placed in service were associated with the construction of the Greeley Crescent fresh water delivery system and expansion of the Mustang fresh water delivery system. Fresh Water Delivery depreciation and amortization expense was flat for 2016 as compared with 2015.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense General and administrative expense is recorded within our Investments and Other reportable segment. General and administrative expense increased $3.5 million during 2017 as compared with 2016. The increase is primarily due to increased third party general and administrative expenses such as legal and financial advisory fees resulting from transactions. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 3. Transactions with Affiliates.\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $7.1 million during 2016 as compared with 2015. The increase is due to the omnibus agreement with Noble that we entered into effective as of the IPO date and that provides for payment of an annual general and administrative fee, initially in the amount of $6.9 million (prorated for the first year of service), for the provision of certain services by Noble and its affiliates. The increase is also due to incremental expenses that we now incur related to our being a publicly traded partnership.\nOther (Income) Expense Trend Analysis Table 229: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\nfrom Prior Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\nfrom Prior Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (Income) Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest Expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(41\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalized Interest\n</td> <td>(2,456\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>204\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(807\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(68\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,519\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest Expense, Net\n</td> <td>1,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(52\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment Income\n</td> <td>(6,334\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,526\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,621\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Other (Income) Expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4,731\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>310\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,153\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,335\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(26\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Expense, Net Interest Expense is recorded within our Investments and Other reportable segment. For periods prior to the IPO, interest expense represents allocations from Noble to our Predecessor. The allocations were based on the percentage that our Predecessor's capital expenditures comprised of Noble's total consolidated capital expenditures. For periods subsequent to the IPO, interest expense represents interest incurred in connection with our revolving credit facility. Our interest expense includes interest on outstanding balances and commitment fees on the undrawn portion of our revolving credit facility as well as the non-cash amortization of origination fees. A portion of the interest expense is capitalized based upon construction-in-progress during the year. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4. Property, Plant and Equipment for our construction-in-progress balances as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nInterest expense decreased $0.1 million during 2017 as compared with 2016. The decrease is due primarily to increased interest expense allocations from Noble during the 2016 periods partially offset by interest incurred in connection with our revolving credit facility during the 2017 periods. Capitalized interest increased $1.6 million during 2017 as compared with 2016 due to an increase in construction-in-progress during 2017 as compared with 2016.\nInterest expense decreased $2.9 million during 2016 as compared with 2015 as our Predecessor's capital expenditures represented a lower percentage of Noble's total consolidated capital expenditures during 2016 as compared with 2015 and the allocation of interest expense ceased subsequent to the IPO. Interest expense during 2016 also includes the non-cash amortization of origination fees and commitment fees on the undrawn portion of our revolving credit facility. No amounts were\ndrawn on our revolving credit facility during 2016. Capitalized interest decreased $1.7 million during 2016 as compared with 2015 due to a decrease in our average construction-in-progress during 2016 as compared with 2015 .\nInvestment Income\nInvestment income is recorded within our Investments and Other reportable segment. Investment income increased during 2017 as compared with 2016 primarily due to earnings from our investment in the Advantage Joint Venture. Crude oil throughput volumes during 2017 averaged 44 MBbl/d. Investment income was flat for 2016 as compared with 2015.\nIncome Tax Provision\nSee Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 13. Income Taxes for a discussion of the changes in our income tax provision and effective tax rates.\nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP Financial Measure)\nAdjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to net income, net cash provided by (used in) operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income or net cash, and these measures may vary from those of other companies. As a result, our Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures of other companies in our industry.\nFor a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, see Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, below.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before income taxes, net interest expense, depreciation and amortization and unit-based compensation. Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, industry analysts, lenders and ratings agencies, to assess:\nTable 230: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our operating performance as compared with those of other companies in the midstream energy industry, without regard to financing methods, historical cost basis or capital structure;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 231: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to our partners;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 232: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 233: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA provides information useful to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA are net income and net cash provided by operating activities. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure as reported in accordance with GAAP.\nDistributable Cash Flow (Non-GAAP Financial Measure)\nDistributable cash flow should not be considered an alternative to net income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Distributable cash flow excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income or net cash provided by operating activities, and these measures may vary from those of other companies. As a result, our distributable cash flow may not be comparable to similar measures of other companies in our industry.\nFor a a reconciliation of distributable cash flow to its most comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, see Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, below.\nWe define distributable cash flow as Adjusted EBITDA less estimated maintenance capital expenditures and cash interest paid. Distributable cash flow does not reflect changes in working capital balances. Our partnership agreement requires us to distribute all available cash on a quarterly basis, and distributable cash flow is one of the factors used by the board of directors of our General Partner to help determine the amount of cash that is available to our unitholders for a given period. Therefore, we believe distributable cash flow provides information useful to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to distributable cash flow are net income and net cash provided by operating activities. Distributable cash flow should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure as reported in accordance with GAAP.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe following tables present reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow to net income and net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, for each of the periods indicated.\nReconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow\nTable 234:

and an unaffiliated third party. We expect our ongoing sources of liquidity to include cash generated from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and issuances of additional equity or debt securities. We believe that cash generated from these sources will be sufficient to meet our short-term working capital requirements and long-term capital expenditure requirements and to make quarterly cash distributions. We do not have any commitment from Noble or our General Partner or any of their respective affiliates to fund our cash flow deficits or provide other direct or indirect financial assistance to us. Certain consolidated subsidiaries make distributions to or receive contributions from Noble in proportion to Noble's ownership in such subsidiary.\nOur partnership agreement requires that we distribute all of our available cash to our unitholders. As a result, we expect to rely primarily upon external financing sources, including our revolving credit facility and the issuance of debt and equity securities, to fund acquisitions and our expansion capital expenditures.\nDuring 2017, we utilized external financing sources to fund portions of our construction activities, the Advantage acquisition, and the cash consideration for the Contributed Assets as well as to make repayments on our revolving credit facility. Our external financing sources consisted of the Private Placement, the Unit Offering and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1. Organization and Nature of Operations and see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6.

Additions to property, plant and equipment were higher in 2017 primarily due to the construction of the Greeley Crescent gathering and fresh water delivery system as well as construction of the Delaware Basin gathering system. Additions to investments were also higher in 2017 due to our investment in the Advantage Joint Venture.\nCash used in investing activities decreased during 2016 as compared with 2015. Additions to property, plant and equipment were higher in 2015 primarily due to construction of East Pony crude oil gathering infrastructure and expansion of the Wells Ranch CGF, which were placed into service at the end of the first quarter of 2015.\nCash provided by financing activities increased during 2017 as compared with 2016. During 2017, our primary financing activities consisted of net borrowings under our revolving credit facility ($85 million), net proceeds from offerings ($312.6 million), contributions from noncontrolling interest owners ($105.9 million), a distribution to Noble for the cash consideration paid for the Contributed Assets ($245.0 million), distributions to our unitholders ($59.9 million), and distributions to noncontrolling interest owners ($21.7 million). During 2016, our primary financing activities consisted cash distributions to our Parent ($42.5 million), proceeds from the IPO of common units ($300.6 million), distributions to Noble subsequent to the IPO ($296.8 million), and distributions to noncontrolling interests ($10.1 million). The increase is primarily due to increased contributions from noncontrolling interest owners and net borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\nDuring 2015, our sole financing activity was a cash contribution from our Parent ($11.7 million).\nRevolving Credit Facility\nOn September 20, 2016, we entered into a credit agreement for a $350 million revolving credit facility. The borrowing capacity on the revolving credit facility may be increased by an additional $350 million subject to certain conditions including compliance with the covenants contained in the credit agreement and requisite commitments from existing or new lenders. The revolving credit facility is available to fund working capital and to finance acquisitions and expansion capital expenditures. As of December 31, 2017, $85 million was outstanding under our revolving credit facility. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6. Long-Term Debt.\nCapital Leases\nWe may also enter into capital lease arrangements for property or equipment to be used in our business. During third quarter 2016, we entered into a capital lease for a pond to be used in our fresh water delivery system. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have not entered into any transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements that would result in off-balance sheet liabilities.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes certain contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 that are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets and/or disclosed in the accompanying notes.

We expect to fund at least a portion of future expansion capital expenditures with borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We expect our maintenance capital expenditures to be funded primarily from cash flows from operations.\nCapital expenditures and other investing activities (on an accrual basis) were as follows: Table 248: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gathering System Expenditures\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>373,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fresh Water Delivery System Expenditures\n</td> <td>16,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Capital Expenditures\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>390,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Additions to Investments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>68,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>147\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, gathering system expenditures were primarily associated with the construction of the Greeley Crescent, Delaware Basin and Mustang gathering systems, expansion of the Wells Ranch gathering system and construction of the connection from the Billy Miner I CGF in the Delaware Basin to the Advantage pipeline.

Fresh water delivery system expenditures were primarily related to the expansion of the Wells Ranch, Mustang and East Pony fresh water delivery systems as well as the construction of the Greeley Crescent fresh water delivery system.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, gathering system expenditures were primarily associated with the construction of the East Pony crude oil gathering system and expansion of the Wells Ranch CGF. Fresh water delivery system expenditures were primarily related to the construction of the Mustang fresh water delivery system and expansion of the Wells Ranch fresh water delivery system.\nThe investment in our White Cliffs Interest was related to our share of the funding for an expansion of the pipeline's crude oil capacity to approximately 215,000 Bbl/d. The expansion was completed during second quarter 2016.\nCash Distributions\nOur partnership agreement requires that we distribute all of our available cash quarterly. Under our current cash distribution policy, we intend to make distributions of at least the minimum quarterly distribution of $0.375 per unit for each whole quarter, or $1.50 per unit on an annualized basis, to the holders of our Common and Subordinated Units to the extent we have sufficient available cash after the establishment of cash reserves and the payment of costs and expenses, including reimbursements of expenses to our General Partner. Quarterly distributions, if any, will be made within 45 days after the end of each calendar quarter to holders of record on the applicable record date.\nOn January 25, 2018, the board of directors of our General Partner declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.4883 per limited partner unit. The distribution was paid on February 12, 2018, to unitholders of record on February 5, 2018. Also on February 12, 2018, a cash distribution of $0.5 million was paid to Noble related to its IDRs, based upon the level of distribution paid per Common and Subordinated Unit.\nFor future quarters, the minimum quarterly distribution of $0.375 per unit equates to $14.9 million per quarter, or $59.4 million million per year, based on the number of Common and Subordinated Units outstanding as of December 31, 2017.\nWe expect that if we are successful in executing our business strategy, we will grow our business in a steady and sustainable manner and distribute to our unitholders a portion of any increase in our cash available for distribution resulting from such growth. We expect our general partner may cause us to establish reserves for specific purposes, such as major capital expenditures or debt service payments, or may choose to generally reserve cash in the form of excess distribution coverage from time to time for the purpose of maintaining stability or growth in our quarterly distributions. In addition, our general partner may cause us to borrow amounts to fund distributions in quarters when we generate less cash than is necessary to sustain or grow our cash distributions per unit. Our cash distribution policy reflects a judgment that our unitholders will be better served by our distributing rather than retaining our cash available for distribution. The board of directors of our General Partner has considerable discretion to determine the amount of our available cash each quarter. In addition, the board of directors of our General Partner may change our cash distribution policy at any time.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires our management to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. When alternatives exist among various accounting methods, the choice of accounting method can have a significant impact on reported amounts. The following is a discussion of the accounting policies, estimates and judgments which management believes are most significant in the application of U.S. GAAP used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost upon acquisition. Expenditures which extend the useful lives of existing property, plant and equipment are capitalized. We capitalize construction-related direct labor and incremental costs, while repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.\nWhen properties are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts and any profit or loss on disposition is recognized as gain or loss.\nWe use the straight line method for computing depreciation on our long-lived assets. The determination of estimated useful lives is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations. If the useful lives of the assets were found to be shorter than originally estimated, depreciation and amortization charges would be accelerated.\nAn alternative method of computing depreciation expense is the units-of-production method which, in our case, would generally have been based on throughput volumes. If we had used the units-of-production method, our financial position and results of operations could have been significantly different. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4. Property, Plant and Equipment.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets Property, plant and equipment are generally stated at the lower of historical cost less accumulated depreciation or fair value, if impaired. Property, plant and equipment balances are evaluated for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable from expected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset. If the carrying amount of the asset is not expected to be recoverable from future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment may be recognized. Any impairment is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair value.\nIn assessing long-lived assets for impairments, our management evaluates changes in our business and economic conditions and their implications for recoverability of the assets' carrying amounts. A substantial portion of our revenues arise from services provided to Noble. Therefore, significant downward revisions in reserve estimates or changes in future development plans by Noble, to the extent they affect our operations, may necessitate assessment of the carrying amount of our affected assets for recoverability.\nSuch assessment requires application of judgment regarding the use and ultimate disposition of the asset, long-range revenue and expense estimates, global and regional economic conditions, including commodity prices and drilling activity by our customers, as well as other factors affecting estimated future net cash flows. The measure of impairments to be recognized, if any, depends upon management's estimate of the asset's fair value, which may be determined based on the estimates of future net cash flows or values at which similar assets were transferred in the market in recent transactions, if such data is available. There have been no long-lived asset impairments. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4. Property, Plant and Equipment.\nAsset Retirement Obligations Our asset retirement obligations (ARO) consist of estimated costs of dismantlement, removal, site reclamation and similar activities associated with our infrastructure assets. We recognize the fair value of a liability for an ARO in the period in which it is incurred, when we have an existing legal obligation associated with the retirement of our infrastructure assets and the obligation can reasonably be estimated. The associated asset retirement cost is capitalized as part of the carrying cost of the infrastructure asset. The recognition of an ARO requires that management make numerous estimates, assumptions and judgments regarding such factors as: the existence of a legal obligation for an ARO, estimated probabilities, amounts and timing of settlements, the credit-adjusted risk-free rate to be used, and inflation rates.\nIn periods subsequent to initial measurement of the ARO, we recognize period-to-period changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows. Revisions also result in increases or decreases in the carrying cost of the asset. Increases in the ARO liability due to passage of time impact net income as accretion expense. The related capitalized cost, including revisions thereto, is charged to expense through depreciation and amortization. Asset retirement obligations totaled $10.4 million at December 31, 2017.

Our current areas of focus are in the DJ Basin in Colorado and the Delaware Basin in Texas. We currently provide crude oil, natural gas, and water-related midstream services through long-term, fixed-fee contracts. Our business activities are conducted through three reportable segments: Gathering Systems (crude oil, natural gas and produced water gathering as well as crude oil treating), Fresh Water Delivery, and Investments and Other. We often refer to the services of our Gathering Systems and Fresh Water Delivery reportable segments collectively as our midstream services.\nWe are Noble's primary vehicle for its midstream operations in the onshore United States. We believe that our diverse midstream infrastructure assets and our relationship with Noble position us as a leading midstream service provider.\nSignificant Results\nThe following discussion highlights significant operating, transactional and financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nSignificant Operational Highlights Included:\n \u2022 average crude oil gathering volumes of 65.7 MBbl/d; \n \u2022 average natural gas gathering volumes of 180.9 BBtu/d; \n \u2022 average produced water gathering volumes of 24.4 MBbl/d; \n \u2022 average fresh water delivery volumes of 156.0 MBbl/d; \n \u2022 completion of a produced water expansion project in the Wells Ranch CGF; \n \u2022 completion of construction and commencement of crude oil gathering, produced water gathering and fresh water delivery services to an unaffiliated third party in the Greeley Crescent IDP; \n \u2022 completion of construction of the Billy Miner I and Jesse James CGFs in the Delaware Basin; \n \u2022 commencement of crude oil, natural gas and produced water gathering services in the Delaware Basin; and \n \u2022 completion of construction of the connection from our CGFs in the Delaware Basin to the Advantage Pipeline. \nSignificant Transactional Highlights Included:\n \u2022 completion of the Advantage acquisition through the Advantage Joint Venture; \n \u2022 acquisition of the remaining 20% limited partner interest in Colorado River DevCo LP and an additional 15% limited partner interest in Blanco River DevCo LP from Noble; \n \u2022 completion of the Private Placement for gross proceeds of approximately $142.6 million and net proceeds of approximately $138.0 million; \n \u2022 completion of the Unit Offering for gross proceeds of approximately $174.8 million and net proceeds of $174.1 million; and \n \u2022 entrance into the Acquisition Agreement with Greenfield Member to acquire Saddle Butte for approximately $638.5 million, subject to customary adjustments following closing.  Significant Financial Highlights Included:\n \u2022 net income of $163.6 million, of which $140.6 million is attributable to the Partnership; \n \u2022 cash distributions declared of $0.4108 per unit for first quarter 2017 and paid during second quarter 2017; \n \u2022 cash distributions declared of $0.4457 per unit for second quarter 2017 and paid during third quarter 2017; \n \u2022 cash distributions declared of $0.4665 per unit for third quarter 2017 and paid during fourth quarter 2017 \n \u2022 cash distributions declared of $0.4883 per unit for fourth quarter 2017; \n \u2022 net cash provided by operating activities of $166.2 million; \n \u2022 capital expenditures, excluding additions to investments and on an accrual basis, of $390.3 million; \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP financial measure) of $179.0 million, of which $154.5 million is attributable to the Partnership; and \n \u2022 distributable cash flow (non-GAAP financial measure) of $137.9 million.  For additional information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures, see Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP Financial Measure), Distributable Cash Flow (Non-GAAP Financial Measure) and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, below.\nOPERATING OUTLOOK\n2018 Capital Investment Program\nOur preliminary 2018 capital investment program will accommodate a gross investment level of approximately $485 to $535 million, with $255 to $285 million attributable to the Partnership. We will evaluate the level of capital spending throughout the year based on the following factors, among others, and their effect on project financial returns:\n \u2022 pace of our customers' development; \n \u2022 operating and construction costs and our ability to achieve material supplier price reductions; \n \u2022 impact of new laws and regulations on our business practices; \n \u2022 indebtedness levels; and \n \u2022 availability of financing or other sources of funding.  We plan to fund our investment program with cash on hand, from cash generated from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and, if necessary, the issuance of additional equity or debt securities.\nDedication and ROFR Update\nOn April 24, 2017, Noble completed the acquisition of Clayton Williams Energy, Inc. Upon closing of the acquisition, approximately 64,000 net acres in the Delaware Basin were dedicated to us for infield crude oil, natural gas, and produced water gathering. We have a ROFR on the remaining acreage acquired by Noble. Additionally, an infield natural gas gathering dedication was added to the existing crude oil and produced water gathering dedication on substantially all of Noble's legacy 47,000 Delaware Basin net acres. Both acreage dedications are held by the Blanco River DevCo.\nIn conjunction with the new dedications, we waived our ROFR for natural gas processing on approximately 80,000 net acres in the Delaware Basin, of which, approximately 35,000 net acres were dedicated to a third party through 2021.\nDevelopment Project Updates\nLaramie River DevCo LP During the second quarter of 2017, we commenced Fresh water deliveries to an unaffiliated third party in the Greeley Crescent IDP. We also began gathering crude oil and produced water for this customer in the third quarter of 2017. Additionally, we connected 90 equivalent wells, normalized to 4,500 lateral feet, to our system during 2017.\nBlanco River DevCo LP We began construction of the Billy Miner I and the Jesse James CGFs. During the third quarter of 2017, we placed the Billy Miner I CGF in service. As a result of the strong well performance and plans for additional wells to be tied into the facility, we completed a debottlenecking project with minor facility modifications in late August, increasing crude oil, natural gas and produced water throughput capacity to 15 MBbl/d, 30 MMcf/d, and 30 MBw/d, respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2017, our second CGF, Jesse James, was placed in service. The Jesse James CGF currently has crude oil, natural gas and produced water throughput capacity of 15 MBbl/d, 30 MMcf/d, and 30 MBw/d, respectively. We connected 29 equivalent wells to our gathering systems during 2017. Additionally, we also completed backbone gathering infrastructure on the Southern portion of Noble Energy's Delaware Basin Acreage. Construction is underway on three additional CGFs which are scheduled to be online by the first half of 2018.\nTrinity River DevCo LLC We completed construction of the 15-mile connection from our CGFs in the Delaware Basin to the Advantage pipeline. Crude oil from the Billy Miner I and Jesse James CGFs began flowing through the connection to the Advantage Pipeline.\nColorado River DevCo LP During 2017, we connected 189 equivalent wells, to our gathering systems in the Wells Ranch IDP and East Pony IDP. We also delivered fresh water to 110 equivalent wells in the Wells Ranch IDP. At the Wells Ranch CGF, we successfully completed a produced water expansion project, which increased produced water capacity to 30 MBbl/d.\nGreen River DevCo LP During 2017, we began construction activities on the expansion of our freshwater system in the Mustang IDP. The freshwater expansion commenced operations in December 2017. Additionally, construction is underway on the backbone gathering infrastructure buildout, which we expect to complete in early 2018.\nSan Juan River DevCo LP During 2017, we delivered freshwater to 88 equivalent wells in the East Pony IDP.\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nOur management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics, each as described in more detail below, to analyze our performance. These metrics are significant factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include:\n \u2022 throughput volumes (Gathering Systems and Fresh Water Delivery reportable segments); \n \u2022 operating costs and expenses; \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP financial measure); \n \u2022 distributable cash flow (non-GAAP financial measure); and \n \u2022 capital expenditures. \nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nResults of operations were as follows:\nTable 208: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Midstream Services - Affiliate\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>224,401\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>160,724\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>87,837\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Midstream Services - Third Party\n</td> <td>14,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Revenues\n</td> <td>239,281\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>160,724\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87,837\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs and Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct Operating\n</td> <td>54,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and Amortization\n</td> <td>12,953\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,891\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and Administrative\n</td> <td>13,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Operating Expenses\n</td> <td>80,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48,087\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Income\n</td> <td>158,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61,242\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (Income) Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest Expense, Net of Amount Capitalized\n</td> <td>1,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment Income\n</td> <td>(6,334\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,526\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,621\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Other (Income) Expense\n</td> <td>(4,731\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,153\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(26\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income Before Income Taxes\n</td> <td>163,656\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>113,790\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61,268\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income Tax Provision\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Income\n</td> <td>163,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Net Income Prior to the IPO on September 20, 2016\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,990\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Income Subsequent to the IPO on September 20, 2016\n</td> <td>163,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\n</td> <td>23,064\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Income Attributable to Noble Midstream Partners LP\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>140,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA(1) Attributable to Noble Midstream Partners LP\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>154,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,697\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distributable Cash Flow(1) of Noble Midstream Partners LP\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>137,935\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,425\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow are not defined in GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure as reported in accordance with GAAP. For additional information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures, please see - Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP Financial Measure), Distributable Cash Flow (Non-GAAP Financial Measure) and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, below. \nThroughput Volumes\nThe amount of revenue we generate primarily depends on the volumes of crude oil, natural gas and water for which we provide midstream services. These volumes are affected primarily by the level of drilling and completion activity by our customers in our areas of operations, and by changes in the supply of and demand for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs in the markets served directly or indirectly by our assets.\nOur customers' willingness to engage in drilling and completion activity is determined by a number of factors, the most important of which are the prevailing and projected prices of crude oil and natural gas, the cost to drill and operate a well, expected well performance, the availability and cost of capital, and environmental and government regulations. We generally expect the level of drilling to positively correlate with long-term trends in commodity prices.

Revenues from midstream services increased during 2017 as compared with 2016 due to the following:\n \u2022 an increase of $17.6 million in fresh water delivery revenues driven by increased fresh water volumes delivered to the Wells Ranch IDP and East Pony IDP due to fresh water volumes required per well for higher intensity completions; \n \u2022 an increase of $15.6 million in water logistic services revenues, including revenue derived from water transfer, hauling, recycling, and disposal services, driven by increased services in the Wells Ranch IDP and East Pony IDP; \n \u2022 an increase of $14.9 million in crude oil and produced water gathering services revenues and fresh water delivery revenues due to the commencement of services in the Greeley Crescent IDP to an unaffiliated third party during 2017; \n \u2022 an increase of $9.6 million in natural gas gathering services revenues driven by increased throughput volumes in our Wells Ranch IDP natural gas gathering systems resulting from expansion and gathering system growth; \n \u2022 an increase of $10.3 million in crude oil gathering services revenues driven by increased throughput volumes in our Wells Ranch IDP and East Pony IDP crude oil gathering systems resulting from expansion and gathering system growth; \n \u2022 an increase of $6.2 million in gathering revenues and fresh water delivery revenues driven by rate escalations; \n \u2022 an increase of $5.9 million in crude oil, natural gas, and produced water gathering services due to the commencement of services in the Delaware Basin during third quarter 2017;  partially offset by:\n \u2022 a decrease of $4.7 million in fresh water delivery revenues related to the Mustang IDP due to the timing of well completion activity by Noble.  Revenues from midstream services increased during 2016 as compared with 2015 due to the following:\n \u2022 an increase of $13.6 million in crude oil gathering revenues due to higher volumes flowing through the expanded Wells Ranch IDP and crude oil gathering system, driven by Noble's 2016 well completion activities, as well as a rate increase; \n \u2022 an increase of $14.1 million in natural gas gathering revenues due to higher volumes flowing through the expanded Wells Ranch IDP and natural gas gathering system, driven by Noble's 2016 well completion activities, as well as a rate increase; \n \u2022 an increase of $8.9 million in produced water gathering revenues due to higher volumes flowing through the expanded Wells Ranch IDP and water gathering system, driven by Noble's 2016 well completion activities, \n \u2022 an increase of $32.9 million in fresh water delivery revenues due to higher fresh water volumes delivered to the Wells Ranch IDP as required for higher intensity well completions, the initiation of fresh water delivery services to the Mustang IDP as well as a rate increase; \n \u2022 an increase of $5.2 million related to water logistic services, including water transfer and disposal services, and electricity pass-through revenues driven by the commencement of both services during fourth quarter 2015;  partially offset by:\n \u2022 a decrease of $3.7 million in produced water gathering services due to a rate decrease at the Wells Ranch IDP area. \nCosts and Expenses\nDirect Operating Expense\nWe seek to maximize the profitability of our operations in part by minimizing, to the extent appropriate, expenses directly associated with operating our assets. Direct labor costs, ad valorem taxes, repair and maintenance costs, integrity management costs, utilities and contract services comprise the most significant portion of our operations and maintenance expense. Many of these expenses remain relatively stable across broad ranges of throughput volumes, but a portion of these expenses can fluctuate from period to period depending on the mix of activities performed during that period and the timing of these expenses. We also seek to manage operating expenditures on our midstream systems by scheduling maintenance over time to avoid significant variability in our maintenance expenditures and minimize their impact on our cash flow.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nFollowing the completion of the IPO, Noble charges us a combination of direct and allocated charges for general and administrative services. Direct charges include a fixed fee under our omnibus agreement and compensation of our executives under our secondment agreement based on the percentage of time spent working on us. Between January 2015 and the IPO date, Noble charged us a fixed fee for overhead and support services.\nWe incur incremental general and administrative expenses attributable to being a publicly traded partnership, including expenses associated with: annual, quarterly and current reporting with the SEC; tax return and Schedule K-1 preparation and distribution; Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 compliance; NYSE listing; independent auditor fees; legal fees; investor relations expenses; transfer agent and registrar fees; incremental salary and benefits costs of seconded employees; outside director fees; director and officer insurance coverage expenses; and compensation expense associated with the LTIP.\nCosts and Expenses Trend Analysis\nCosts and expenses were as follows: Table 228: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\nfrom Prior Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\nfrom Prior Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs and Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct Operating\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and Amortization\n</td> <td>12,953\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,891\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and Administrative\n</td> <td>13,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>258\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Operating Expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,087\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDirect Operating Expenses Direct operating expenses increased during 2017 as compared with 2016 and increased during 2016 as compared with 2015. The increases in direct operating expenses by reportable segment were as follows:\nGathering Systems Gathering Systems direct operating expenses increased $22.7 million during 2017 as compared with 2016 and increased $0.6 million during 2016 as compared with 2015. The increase in both years was primarily attributable to an increase in gathering systems and facilities operating expense associated with higher gathered volumes, general repairs and maintenance of our gathering systems and facilities, and produced water services expense resulting from services provided by third parties. In 2016, the increase in Gathering Systems direct operating expenses was partially offset by a decrease in crude oil treating expense due to a reduction in quantities treated in our facilities.\nFresh Water Delivery Fresh Water Delivery direct operating expenses increased $1.6 million during 2017 as compared with 2016 primarily due to an increase in water delivery and services expense driven by an increase in fresh water volumes required per well for higher intensity completions. Fresh Water Delivery direct operating expenses increased $11.8 million during 2016 as compared with 2015 primarily due to an increase in water delivery and services expense driven by an increase in fresh water volumes required per well for higher intensity completions and an expanded scope of services delivered.\nInvestments and Other Investments and Other direct operating expenses increased $0.6 million during 2017 as compared with 2016 due to increased insurance expense. Investments and Other direct operating expenses decreased $0.3 million during 2016 as compared with 2015 primarily due to decreased insurance expense. Prior to the IPO, insurance expense was allocated from Noble to our Predecessor.\nDepreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense increased during 2017 as compared with 2016 and increased during 2016 as compared with 2015. The increases in direct operating expenses by reportable segment were as follows:\nGathering Systems Gathering Systems depreciation and amortization expense increased $3.3 million during 2017 as compared with 2016 primarily due to assets placed in service in 2017. Assets placed in service were associated with the expansion of the Wells Ranch CGF and gathering system, construction of the Greeley Crescent gathering system, construction of the Delaware Basin gathering system, and completion of the Jesse James and Billy Miner I CGFs. Gathering Systems depreciation and amortization expense increased $2.1 million during 2016 as compared with 2015 primarily due to assets placed in service as a result of the expansion of the Wells Ranch CGF and commissioning of the East Pony crude oil gathering system during 2016 and the expansion of the Wells Ranch gathering system at the end of third quarter 2015.\nFresh Water Delivery Fresh Water Delivery depreciation and amortization expense increased $0.6 million during 2017 as compared with 2016 primarily due to assets placed in service in 2017. Assets placed in service were associated with the construction of the Greeley Crescent fresh water delivery system and expansion of the Mustang fresh water delivery system. Fresh Water Delivery depreciation and amortization expense was flat for 2016 as compared with 2015.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense General and administrative expense is recorded within our Investments and Other reportable segment. General and administrative expense increased $3.5 million during 2017 as compared with 2016. The increase is primarily due to increased third party general and administrative expenses such as legal and financial advisory fees resulting from transactions. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 3. Transactions with Affiliates.\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $7.1 million during 2016 as compared with 2015. The increase is due to the omnibus agreement with Noble that we entered into effective as of the IPO date and that provides for payment of an annual general and administrative fee, initially in the amount of $6.9 million (prorated for the first year of service), for the provision of certain services by Noble and its affiliates. The increase is also due to incremental expenses that we now incur related to our being a publicly traded partnership.\nOther (Income) Expense Trend Analysis Table 229: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\nfrom Prior Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\nfrom Prior Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (Income) Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest Expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(41\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalized Interest\n</td> <td>(2,456\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>204\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(807\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(68\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,519\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest Expense, Net\n</td> <td>1,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(52\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment Income\n</td> <td>(6,334\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,526\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,621\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Other (Income) Expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4,731\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>310\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,153\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,335\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(26\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Expense, Net Interest Expense is recorded within our Investments and Other reportable segment. For periods prior to the IPO, interest expense represents allocations from Noble to our Predecessor. The allocations were based on the percentage that our Predecessor's capital expenditures comprised of Noble's total consolidated capital expenditures. For periods subsequent to the IPO, interest expense represents interest incurred in connection with our revolving credit facility. Our interest expense includes interest on outstanding balances and commitment fees on the undrawn portion of our revolving credit facility as well as the non-cash amortization of origination fees. A portion of the interest expense is capitalized based upon construction-in-progress during the year. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4. Property, Plant and Equipment for our construction-in-progress balances as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nInterest expense decreased $0.1 million during 2017 as compared with 2016. The decrease is due primarily to increased interest expense allocations from Noble during the 2016 periods partially offset by interest incurred in connection with our revolving credit facility during the 2017 periods. Capitalized interest increased $1.6 million during 2017 as compared with 2016 due to an increase in construction-in-progress during 2017 as compared with 2016.\nInterest expense decreased $2.9 million during 2016 as compared with 2015 as our Predecessor's capital expenditures represented a lower percentage of Noble's total consolidated capital expenditures during 2016 as compared with 2015 and the allocation of interest expense ceased subsequent to the IPO. Interest expense during 2016 also includes the non-cash amortization of origination fees and commitment fees on the undrawn portion of our revolving credit facility. No amounts were\ndrawn on our revolving credit facility during 2016. Capitalized interest decreased $1.7 million during 2016 as compared with 2015 due to a decrease in our average construction-in-progress during 2016 as compared with 2015 .\nInvestment Income\nInvestment income is recorded within our Investments and Other reportable segment. Investment income increased during 2017 as compared with 2016 primarily due to earnings from our investment in the Advantage Joint Venture. Crude oil throughput volumes during 2017 averaged 44 MBbl/d. Investment income was flat for 2016 as compared with 2015.\nIncome Tax Provision\nSee Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 13. Income Taxes for a discussion of the changes in our income tax provision and effective tax rates.\nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP Financial Measure)\nAdjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to net income, net cash provided by (used in) operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income or net cash, and these measures may vary from those of other companies. As a result, our Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures of other companies in our industry.\nFor a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, see Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, below.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before income taxes, net interest expense, depreciation and amortization and unit-based compensation. Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, industry analysts, lenders and ratings agencies, to assess:\n \u2022 our operating performance as compared with those of other companies in the midstream energy industry, without regard to financing methods, historical cost basis or capital structure; \n \u2022 the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to our partners; \n \u2022 our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and \n \u2022 the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.  We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA provides information useful to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA are net income and net cash provided by operating activities. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure as reported in accordance with GAAP.\nDistributable Cash Flow (Non-GAAP Financial Measure)\nDistributable cash flow should not be considered an alternative to net income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Distributable cash flow excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income or net cash provided by operating activities, and these measures may vary from those of other companies. As a result, our distributable cash flow may not be comparable to similar measures of other companies in our industry.\nFor a a reconciliation of distributable cash flow to its most comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, see Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, below.\nWe define distributable cash flow as Adjusted EBITDA less estimated maintenance capital expenditures and cash interest paid. Distributable cash flow does not reflect changes in working capital balances. Our partnership agreement requires us to distribute all available cash on a quarterly basis, and distributable cash flow is one of the factors used by the board of directors of our General Partner to help determine the amount of cash that is available to our unitholders for a given period. Therefore, we believe distributable cash flow provides information useful to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to distributable cash flow are net income and net cash provided by operating activities. Distributable cash flow should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure as reported in accordance with GAAP.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe following tables present reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow to net income and net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, for each of the periods indicated.\nReconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow\nTable 234:

and an unaffiliated third party. We expect our ongoing sources of liquidity to include cash generated from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and issuances of additional equity or debt securities. We believe that cash generated from these sources will be sufficient to meet our short-term working capital requirements and long-term capital expenditure requirements and to make quarterly cash distributions. We do not have any commitment from Noble or our General Partner or any of their respective affiliates to fund our cash flow deficits or provide other direct or indirect financial assistance to us. Certain consolidated subsidiaries make distributions to or receive contributions from Noble in proportion to Noble's ownership in such subsidiary.\nOur partnership agreement requires that we distribute all of our available cash to our unitholders. As a result, we expect to rely primarily upon external financing sources, including our revolving credit facility and the issuance of debt and equity securities, to fund acquisitions and our expansion capital expenditures.\nDuring 2017, we utilized external financing sources to fund portions of our construction activities, the Advantage acquisition, and the cash consideration for the Contributed Assets as well as to make repayments on our revolving credit facility. Our external financing sources consisted of the Private Placement, the Unit Offering and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. See Item 8.

Additions to property, plant and equipment were higher in 2017 primarily due to the construction of the Greeley Crescent gathering and fresh water delivery system as well as construction of the Delaware Basin gathering system. Additions to investments were also higher in 2017 due to our investment in the Advantage Joint Venture.\nCash used in investing activities decreased during 2016 as compared with 2015. Additions to property, plant and equipment were higher in 2015 primarily due to construction of East Pony crude oil gathering infrastructure and expansion of the Wells Ranch CGF, which were placed into service at the end of the first quarter of 2015.\nCash provided by financing activities increased during 2017 as compared with 2016. During 2017, our primary financing activities consisted of net borrowings under our revolving credit facility ($85 million), net proceeds from offerings ($312.6 million), contributions from noncontrolling interest owners ($105.9 million), a distribution to Noble for the cash consideration paid for the Contributed Assets ($245.0 million), distributions to our unitholders ($59.9 million), and distributions to noncontrolling interest owners ($21.7 million). During 2016, our primary financing activities consisted cash distributions to our Parent ($42.5 million), proceeds from the IPO of common units ($300.6 million), distributions to Noble subsequent to the IPO ($296.8 million), and distributions to noncontrolling interests ($10.1 million). The increase is primarily due to increased contributions from noncontrolling interest owners and net borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\nDuring 2015, our sole financing activity was a cash contribution from our Parent ($11.7 million).\nRevolving Credit Facility\nOn September 20, 2016, we entered into a credit agreement for a $350 million revolving credit facility. The borrowing capacity on the revolving credit facility may be increased by an additional $350 million subject to certain conditions including compliance with the covenants contained in the credit agreement and requisite commitments from existing or new lenders. The revolving credit facility is available to fund working capital and to finance acquisitions and expansion capital expenditures. As of December 31, 2017, $85 million was outstanding under our revolving credit facility. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6. Long-Term Debt.\nCapital Leases\nWe may also enter into capital lease arrangements for property or equipment to be used in our business. During third quarter 2016, we entered into a capital lease for a pond to be used in our fresh water delivery system. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have not entered into any transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements that would result in off-balance sheet liabilities.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes certain contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 that are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets and/or disclosed in the accompanying notes.

Capital Requirements\nCapital Expenditures and Planned Capital Expenditures\nThe midstream energy business is capital intensive, requiring the maintenance of existing gathering systems and other midstream assets and facilities and the acquisition or construction and development of new gathering systems and other midstream assets and facilities. Based on the nature of the expenditure, we categorize our capital expenditures as either:\n \u2022 maintenance capital expenditures, which are additions to property, plant and equipment made to maintain, over the long term, our production and/or operating income. We use an estimate of maintenance capital expenditures to determine our operating surplus, for purposes of determining cash available for distributions; or \n \u2022 expansion capital expenditures, which are additions to property, plant and equipment made to construct new midstream infrastructure and those expenditures incurred in order to extend the useful lives of our assets, reduce costs, increase revenues or increase system throughput or capacity from current levels, including well connections that increase existing system throughput.  Our planned expansion capital expenditures, driven primarily by Noble's planned well completions and production growth on our dedicated acreage, will consist primarily of well connections and gathering line additions. We expect to fund at least a portion of future expansion capital expenditures with borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We expect our maintenance capital expenditures to be funded primarily from cash flows from operations.\nCapital expenditures and other investing activities (on an accrual basis) were as follows: Table 248: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gathering System Expenditures\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>373,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fresh Water Delivery System Expenditures\n</td> <td>16,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Capital Expenditures\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>390,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Additions to Investments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>68,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>147\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, gathering system expenditures were primarily associated with the construction of the Greeley Crescent, Delaware Basin and Mustang gathering systems, expansion of the Wells Ranch gathering system and construction of the connection from the Billy Miner I CGF in the Delaware Basin to the Advantage pipeline.

Fresh water delivery system expenditures were primarily related to the construction of the Mustang fresh water delivery system and expansion of the Wells Ranch fresh water delivery system.\nThe investment in our White Cliffs Interest was related to our share of the funding for an expansion of the pipeline's crude oil capacity to approximately 215,000 Bbl/d. The expansion was completed during second quarter 2016.\nCash Distributions\nOur partnership agreement requires that we distribute all of our available cash quarterly. Under our current cash distribution policy, we intend to make distributions of at least the minimum quarterly distribution of $0.375 per unit for each whole quarter, or $1.50 per unit on an annualized basis, to the holders of our Common and Subordinated Units to the extent we have sufficient available cash after the establishment of cash reserves and the payment of costs and expenses, including reimbursements of expenses to our General Partner. Quarterly distributions, if any, will be made within 45 days after the end of each calendar quarter to holders of record on the applicable record date.\nOn January 25, 2018, the board of directors of our General Partner declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.4883 per limited partner unit. The distribution was paid on February 12, 2018, to unitholders of record on February 5, 2018. Also on February 12, 2018, a cash distribution of $0.5 million was paid to Noble related to its IDRs, based upon the level of distribution paid per Common and Subordinated Unit.\nFor future quarters, the minimum quarterly distribution of $0.375 per unit equates to $14.9 million per quarter, or $59.4 million million per year, based on the number of Common and Subordinated Units outstanding as of December 31, 2017.\nWe expect that if we are successful in executing our business strategy, we will grow our business in a steady and sustainable manner and distribute to our unitholders a portion of any increase in our cash available for distribution resulting from such growth. We expect our general partner may cause us to establish reserves for specific purposes, such as major capital expenditures or debt service payments, or may choose to generally reserve cash in the form of excess distribution coverage from time to time for the purpose of maintaining stability or growth in our quarterly distributions. In addition, our general partner may cause us to borrow amounts to fund distributions in quarters when we generate less cash than is necessary to sustain or grow our cash distributions per unit. Our cash distribution policy reflects a judgment that our unitholders will be better served by our distributing rather than retaining our cash available for distribution. The board of directors of our General Partner has considerable discretion to determine the amount of our available cash each quarter. In addition, the board of directors of our General Partner may change our cash distribution policy at any time.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires our management to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. When alternatives exist among various accounting methods, the choice of accounting method can have a significant impact on reported amounts. The following is a discussion of the accounting policies, estimates and judgments which management believes are most significant in the application of U.S. GAAP used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost upon acquisition. Expenditures which extend the useful lives of existing property, plant and equipment are capitalized. We capitalize construction-related direct labor and incremental costs, while repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.\nWhen properties are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts and any profit or loss on disposition is recognized as gain or loss.\nWe use the straight line method for computing depreciation on our long-lived assets. The determination of estimated useful lives is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations. If the useful lives of the assets were found to be shorter than originally estimated, depreciation and amortization charges would be accelerated.\nAn alternative method of computing depreciation expense is the units-of-production method which, in our case, would generally have been based on throughput volumes. If we had used the units-of-production method, our financial position and results of operations could have been significantly different. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4. Property, Plant and Equipment.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets Property, plant and equipment are generally stated at the lower of historical cost less accumulated depreciation or fair value, if impaired. Property, plant and equipment balances are evaluated for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable from expected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset. If the carrying amount of the asset is not expected to be recoverable from future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment may be recognized. Any impairment is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair value.\nIn assessing long-lived assets for impairments, our management evaluates changes in our business and economic conditions and their implications for recoverability of the assets' carrying amounts. A substantial portion of our revenues arise from services provided to Noble. Therefore, significant downward revisions in reserve estimates or changes in future development plans by Noble, to the extent they affect our operations, may necessitate assessment of the carrying amount of our affected assets for recoverability.\nSuch assessment requires application of judgment regarding the use and ultimate disposition of the asset, long-range revenue and expense estimates, global and regional economic conditions, including commodity prices and drilling activity by our customers, as well as other factors affecting estimated future net cash flows. The measure of impairments to be recognized, if any, depends upon management's estimate of the asset's fair value, which may be determined based on the estimates of future net cash flows or values at which similar assets were transferred in the market in recent transactions, if such data is available. There have been no long-lived asset impairments. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4. Property, Plant and Equipment.\nAsset Retirement Obligations Our asset retirement obligations (ARO) consist of estimated costs of dismantlement, removal, site reclamation and similar activities associated with our infrastructure assets. We recognize the fair value of a liability for an ARO in the period in which it is incurred, when we have an existing legal obligation associated with the retirement of our infrastructure assets and the obligation can reasonably be estimated. The associated asset retirement cost is capitalized as part of the carrying cost of the infrastructure asset. The recognition of an ARO requires that management make numerous estimates, assumptions and judgments regarding such factors as: the existence of a legal obligation for an ARO, estimated probabilities, amounts and timing of settlements, the credit-adjusted risk-free rate to be used, and inflation rates.\nIn periods subsequent to initial measurement of the ARO, we recognize period-to-period changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows. Revisions also result in increases or decreases in the carrying cost of the asset. Increases in the ARO liability due to passage of time impact net income as accretion expense. The related capitalized cost, including revisions thereto, is charged to expense through depreciation and amortization. Asset retirement obligations totaled $10.4 million at December 31, 2017.

Our current areas of focus are in the DJ Basin in Colorado and the Delaware Basin in Texas. We currently provide crude oil, natural gas, and water-related midstream services through long-term, fixed-fee contracts. Our business activities are conducted through three reportable segments: Gathering Systems (crude oil, natural gas and produced water gathering as well as crude oil treating), Fresh Water Delivery, and Investments and Other. We often refer to the services of our Gathering Systems and Fresh Water Delivery reportable segments collectively as our midstream services.\nWe are Noble's primary vehicle for its midstream operations in the onshore United States. We believe that our diverse midstream infrastructure assets and our relationship with Noble position us as a leading midstream service provider.\nSignificant Results\nThe following discussion highlights significant operating, transactional and financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nSignificant Operational Highlights Included:\n \u2022 average crude oil gathering volumes of 65.7 MBbl/d; \n \u2022 average natural gas gathering volumes of 180.9 BBtu/d; \n \u2022 average produced water gathering volumes of 24.4 MBbl/d; \n \u2022 average fresh water delivery volumes of 156.0 MBbl/d; \n \u2022 completion of a produced water expansion project in the Wells Ranch CGF; \n \u2022 completion of construction and commencement of crude oil gathering, produced water gathering and fresh water delivery services to an unaffiliated third party in the Greeley Crescent IDP; \n \u2022 completion of construction of the Billy Miner I and Jesse James CGFs in the Delaware Basin; \n \u2022 commencement of crude oil, natural gas and produced water gathering services in the Delaware Basin; and \n \u2022 completion of construction of the connection from our CGFs in the Delaware Basin to the Advantage Pipeline. \nSignificant Transactional Highlights Included:\n \u2022 completion of the Advantage acquisition through the Advantage Joint Venture; \n \u2022 acquisition of the remaining 20% limited partner interest in Colorado River DevCo LP and an additional 15% limited partner interest in Blanco River DevCo LP from Noble; \n \u2022 completion of the Private Placement for gross proceeds of approximately $142.6 million and net proceeds of approximately $138.0 million; \n \u2022 completion of the Unit Offering for gross proceeds of approximately $174.8 million and net proceeds of $174.1 million; and \n \u2022 entrance into the Acquisition Agreement with Greenfield Member to acquire Saddle Butte for approximately $638.5 million, subject to customary adjustments following closing.  Significant Financial Highlights Included:\n \u2022 net income of $163.6 million, of which $140.6 million is attributable to the Partnership; \n \u2022 cash distributions declared of $0.4108 per unit for first quarter 2017 and paid during second quarter 2017; \n \u2022 cash distributions declared of $0.4457 per unit for second quarter 2017 and paid during third quarter 2017; \n \u2022 cash distributions declared of $0.4665 per unit for third quarter 2017 and paid during fourth quarter 2017 \n \u2022 cash distributions declared of $0.4883 per unit for fourth quarter 2017; \n \u2022 net cash provided by operating activities of $166.2 million; \n \u2022 capital expenditures, excluding additions to investments and on an accrual basis, of $390.3 million; \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP financial measure) of $179.0 million, of which $154.5 million is attributable to the Partnership; and \n \u2022 distributable cash flow (non-GAAP financial measure) of $137.9 million.  For additional information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures, see Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP Financial Measure), Distributable Cash Flow (Non-GAAP Financial Measure) and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, below.\nOPERATING OUTLOOK\n2018 Capital Investment Program\nOur preliminary 2018 capital investment program will accommodate a gross investment level of approximately $485 to $535 million, with $255 to $285 million attributable to the Partnership. We will evaluate the level of capital spending throughout the year based on the following factors, among others, and their effect on project financial returns:\n \u2022 pace of our customers' development; \n \u2022 operating and construction costs and our ability to achieve material supplier price reductions; \n \u2022 impact of new laws and regulations on our business practices; \n \u2022 indebtedness levels; and \n \u2022 availability of financing or other sources of funding.  We plan to fund our investment program with cash on hand, from cash generated from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and, if necessary, the issuance of additional equity or debt securities.\nDedication and ROFR Update\nOn April 24, 2017, Noble completed the acquisition of Clayton Williams Energy, Inc. Upon closing of the acquisition, approximately 64,000 net acres in the Delaware Basin were dedicated to us for infield crude oil, natural gas, and produced water gathering. We have a ROFR on the remaining acreage acquired by Noble. Additionally, an infield natural gas gathering dedication was added to the existing crude oil and produced water gathering dedication on substantially all of Noble's legacy 47,000 Delaware Basin net acres. Both acreage dedications are held by the Blanco River DevCo.\nIn conjunction with the new dedications, we waived our ROFR for natural gas processing on approximately 80,000 net acres in the Delaware Basin, of which, approximately 35,000 net acres were dedicated to a third party through 2021.\nDevelopment Project Updates\nLaramie River DevCo LP During the second quarter of 2017, we commenced Fresh water deliveries to an unaffiliated third party in the Greeley Crescent IDP. We also began gathering crude oil and produced water for this customer in the third quarter of 2017. Additionally, we connected 90 equivalent wells, normalized to 4,500 lateral feet, to our system during 2017.\nBlanco River DevCo LP We began construction of the Billy Miner I and the Jesse James CGFs. During the third quarter of 2017, we placed the Billy Miner I CGF in service. As a result of the strong well performance and plans for additional wells to be tied into the facility, we completed a debottlenecking project with minor facility modifications in late August, increasing crude oil, natural gas and produced water throughput capacity to 15 MBbl/d, 30 MMcf/d, and 30 MBw/d, respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2017, our second CGF, Jesse James, was placed in service. The Jesse James CGF currently has crude oil, natural gas and produced water throughput capacity of 15 MBbl/d, 30 MMcf/d, and 30 MBw/d, respectively. We connected 29 equivalent wells to our gathering systems during 2017. Additionally, we also completed backbone gathering infrastructure on the Southern portion of Noble Energy's Delaware Basin Acreage. Construction is underway on three additional CGFs which are scheduled to be online by the first half of 2018.\nTrinity River DevCo LLC We completed construction of the 15-mile connection from our CGFs in the Delaware Basin to the Advantage pipeline. Crude oil from the Billy Miner I and Jesse James CGFs began flowing through the connection to the Advantage Pipeline.\nColorado River DevCo LP During 2017, we connected 189 equivalent wells, to our gathering systems in the Wells Ranch IDP and East Pony IDP. We also delivered fresh water to 110 equivalent wells in the Wells Ranch IDP. At the Wells Ranch CGF, we successfully completed a produced water expansion project, which increased produced water capacity to 30 MBbl/d.\nGreen River DevCo LP During 2017, we began construction activities on the expansion of our freshwater system in the Mustang IDP. The freshwater expansion commenced operations in December 2017. Additionally, construction is underway on the backbone gathering infrastructure buildout, which we expect to complete in early 2018.\nSan Juan River DevCo LP During 2017, we delivered freshwater to 88 equivalent wells in the East Pony IDP.\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nOur management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics, each as described in more detail below, to analyze our performance. These metrics are significant factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include:\n \u2022 throughput volumes (Gathering Systems and Fresh Water Delivery reportable segments); \n \u2022 operating costs and expenses; \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP financial measure); \n \u2022 distributable cash flow (non-GAAP financial measure); and \n \u2022 capital expenditures. \nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nResults of operations were as follows:\n\n (1) Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow are not defined in GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure as reported in accordance with GAAP. For additional information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures, please see - Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP Financial Measure), Distributable Cash Flow (Non-GAAP Financial Measure) and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, below. \nThroughput Volumes\nThe amount of revenue we generate primarily depends on the volumes of crude oil, natural gas and water for which we provide midstream services. These volumes are affected primarily by the level of drilling and completion activity by our customers in our areas of operations, and by changes in the supply of and demand for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs in the markets served directly or indirectly by our assets.\nOur customers' willingness to engage in drilling and completion activity is determined by a number of factors, the most important of which are the prevailing and projected prices of crude oil and natural gas, the cost to drill and operate a well, expected well performance, the availability and cost of capital, and environmental and government regulations. We generally expect the level of drilling to positively correlate with long-term trends in commodity prices. Similarly, production levels nationally and regionally generally tend to positively correlate with drilling activity.\nOur customers have dedicated acreage to us based on the services we provide. Our commercial agreements with Noble provide that, in addition to our existing dedicated acreage, any future acreage that is acquired by Noble in the IDP areas, and that is not subject to a pre-existing third-party commitment, will be included in the dedication to us for midstream services, including gathering and treating.\nRevenues and throughput volumes related to certain midstream services of our Gathering Systems and Fresh Water Delivery reportable segments were as follows: \n (1) See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1. Organization and Nature of Operations for DevCo ownership interests. \n (2) Effective January 1, 2015, we entered into multiple commercial agreements with Noble, for which we receive volumetric fees for the midstream services we provide. \nRevenues\nRevenues from our Gathering System and Fresh Water Delivery reportable segments were as follows:\n\nN/M amount is not meaningful.\nRevenues Trend Analysis\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenues from commercial agreements with Noble. Revenues from midstream services increased during 2017 as compared with 2016 due to the following:\n \u2022 an increase of $17.6 million in fresh water delivery revenues driven by increased fresh water volumes delivered to the Wells Ranch IDP and East Pony IDP due to fresh water volumes required per well for higher intensity completions; \n \u2022 an increase of $15.6 million in water logistic services revenues, including revenue derived from water transfer, hauling, recycling, and disposal services, driven by increased services in the Wells Ranch IDP and East Pony IDP; \n \u2022 an increase of $14.9 million in crude oil and produced water gathering services revenues and fresh water delivery revenues due to the commencement of services in the Greeley Crescent IDP to an unaffiliated third party during 2017; \n \u2022 an increase of $9.6 million in natural gas gathering services revenues driven by increased throughput volumes in our Wells Ranch IDP natural gas gathering systems resulting from expansion and gathering system growth; \n \u2022 an increase of $10.3 million in crude oil gathering services revenues driven by increased throughput volumes in our Wells Ranch IDP and East Pony IDP crude oil gathering systems resulting from expansion and gathering system growth; \n \u2022 an increase of $6.2 million in gathering revenues and fresh water delivery revenues driven by rate escalations; \n \u2022 an increase of $5.9 million in crude oil, natural gas, and produced water gathering services due to the commencement of services in the Delaware Basin during third quarter 2017;  partially offset by:\n \u2022 a decrease of $4.7 million in fresh water delivery revenues related to the Mustang IDP due to the timing of well completion activity by Noble.  Revenues from midstream services increased during 2016 as compared with 2015 due to the following:\n \u2022 an increase of $13.6 million in crude oil gathering revenues due to higher volumes flowing through the expanded Wells Ranch IDP and crude oil gathering system, driven by Noble's 2016 well completion activities, as well as a rate increase; \n \u2022 an increase of $14.1 million in natural gas gathering revenues due to higher volumes flowing through the expanded Wells Ranch IDP and natural gas gathering system, driven by Noble's 2016 well completion activities, as well as a rate increase; \n \u2022 an increase of $8.9 million in produced water gathering revenues due to higher volumes flowing through the expanded Wells Ranch IDP and water gathering system, driven by Noble's 2016 well completion activities, \n \u2022 an increase of $32.9 million in fresh water delivery revenues due to higher fresh water volumes delivered to the Wells Ranch IDP as required for higher intensity well completions, the initiation of fresh water delivery services to the Mustang IDP as well as a rate increase; \n \u2022 an increase of $5.2 million related to water logistic services, including water transfer and disposal services, and electricity pass-through revenues driven by the commencement of both services during fourth quarter 2015;  partially offset by:\n \u2022 a decrease of $3.7 million in produced water gathering services due to a rate decrease at the Wells Ranch IDP area. \nCosts and Expenses\nDirect Operating Expense\nWe seek to maximize the profitability of our operations in part by minimizing, to the extent appropriate, expenses directly associated with operating our assets. Direct labor costs, ad valorem taxes, repair and maintenance costs, integrity management costs, utilities and contract services comprise the most significant portion of our operations and maintenance expense. Many of these expenses remain relatively stable across broad ranges of throughput volumes, but a portion of these expenses can fluctuate from period to period depending on the mix of activities performed during that period and the timing of these expenses. We also seek to manage operating expenditures on our midstream systems by scheduling maintenance over time to avoid significant variability in our maintenance expenditures and minimize their impact on our cash flow.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nFollowing the completion of the IPO, Noble charges us a combination of direct and allocated charges for general and administrative services. Direct charges include a fixed fee under our omnibus agreement and compensation of our executives under our secondment agreement based on the percentage of time spent working on us. Between January 2015 and the IPO date, Noble charged us a fixed fee for overhead and support services.\nWe incur incremental general and administrative expenses attributable to being a publicly traded partnership, including expenses associated with: annual, quarterly and current reporting with the SEC; tax return and Schedule K-1 preparation and distribution; Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 compliance; NYSE listing; independent auditor fees; legal fees; investor relations expenses; transfer agent and registrar fees; incremental salary and benefits costs of seconded employees; outside director fees; director and officer insurance coverage expenses; and compensation expense associated with the LTIP.\nCosts and Expenses Trend Analysis\nCosts and expenses were as follows: \nDirect Operating Expenses Direct operating expenses increased during 2017 as compared with 2016 and increased during 2016 as compared with 2015. The increases in direct operating expenses by reportable segment were as follows:\nGathering Systems Gathering Systems direct operating expenses increased $22.7 million during 2017 as compared with 2016 and increased $0.6 million during 2016 as compared with 2015. The increase in both years was primarily attributable to an increase in gathering systems and facilities operating expense associated with higher gathered volumes, general repairs and maintenance of our gathering systems and facilities, and produced water services expense resulting from services provided by third parties. In 2016, the increase in Gathering Systems direct operating expenses was partially offset by a decrease in crude oil treating expense due to a reduction in quantities treated in our facilities.\nFresh Water Delivery Fresh Water Delivery direct operating expenses increased $1.6 million during 2017 as compared with 2016 primarily due to an increase in water delivery and services expense driven by an increase in fresh water volumes required per well for higher intensity completions. Fresh Water Delivery direct operating expenses increased $11.8 million during 2016 as compared with 2015 primarily due to an increase in water delivery and services expense driven by an increase in fresh water volumes required per well for higher intensity completions and an expanded scope of services delivered.\nInvestments and Other Investments and Other direct operating expenses increased $0.6 million during 2017 as compared with 2016 due to increased insurance expense. Investments and Other direct operating expenses decreased $0.3 million during 2016 as compared with 2015 primarily due to decreased insurance expense. Prior to the IPO, insurance expense was allocated from Noble to our Predecessor.\nDepreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense increased during 2017 as compared with 2016 and increased during 2016 as compared with 2015. The increases in direct operating expenses by reportable segment were as follows:\nGathering Systems Gathering Systems depreciation and amortization expense increased $3.3 million during 2017 as compared with 2016 primarily due to assets placed in service in 2017. Assets placed in service were associated with the expansion of the Wells Ranch CGF and gathering system, construction of the Greeley Crescent gathering system, construction of the Delaware Basin gathering system, and completion of the Jesse James and Billy Miner I CGFs. Gathering Systems depreciation and amortization expense increased $2.1 million during 2016 as compared with 2015 primarily due to assets placed in service as a result of the expansion of the Wells Ranch CGF and commissioning of the East Pony crude oil gathering system during 2016 and the expansion of the Wells Ranch gathering system at the end of third quarter 2015.\nFresh Water Delivery Fresh Water Delivery depreciation and amortization expense increased $0.6 million during 2017 as compared with 2016 primarily due to assets placed in service in 2017. Assets placed in service were associated with the construction of the Greeley Crescent fresh water delivery system and expansion of the Mustang fresh water delivery system. Fresh Water Delivery depreciation and amortization expense was flat for 2016 as compared with 2015.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense General and administrative expense is recorded within our Investments and Other reportable segment. General and administrative expense increased $3.5 million during 2017 as compared with 2016. The increase is primarily due to increased third party general and administrative expenses such as legal and financial advisory fees resulting from transactions. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 3. Transactions with Affiliates.\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $7.1 million during 2016 as compared with 2015. The increase is due to the omnibus agreement with Noble that we entered into effective as of the IPO date and that provides for payment of an annual general and administrative fee, initially in the amount of $6.9 million (prorated for the first year of service), for the provision of certain services by Noble and its affiliates. The increase is also due to incremental expenses that we now incur related to our being a publicly traded partnership.\nOther (Income) Expense Trend Analysis \nInterest Expense, Net Interest Expense is recorded within our Investments and Other reportable segment. For periods prior to the IPO, interest expense represents allocations from Noble to our Predecessor. The allocations were based on the percentage that our Predecessor's capital expenditures comprised of Noble's total consolidated capital expenditures. For periods subsequent to the IPO, interest expense represents interest incurred in connection with our revolving credit facility. Our interest expense includes interest on outstanding balances and commitment fees on the undrawn portion of our revolving credit facility as well as the non-cash amortization of origination fees. A portion of the interest expense is capitalized based upon construction-in-progress during the year. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4. Property, Plant and Equipment for our construction-in-progress balances as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nInterest expense decreased $0.1 million during 2017 as compared with 2016. The decrease is due primarily to increased interest expense allocations from Noble during the 2016 periods partially offset by interest incurred in connection with our revolving credit facility during the 2017 periods. Capitalized interest increased $1.6 million during 2017 as compared with 2016 due to an increase in construction-in-progress during 2017 as compared with 2016.\nInterest expense decreased $2.9 million during 2016 as compared with 2015 as our Predecessor's capital expenditures represented a lower percentage of Noble's total consolidated capital expenditures during 2016 as compared with 2015 and the allocation of interest expense ceased subsequent to the IPO. Interest expense during 2016 also includes the non-cash amortization of origination fees and commitment fees on the undrawn portion of our revolving credit facility. No amounts were\ndrawn on our revolving credit facility during 2016. Capitalized interest decreased $1.7 million during 2016 as compared with 2015 due to a decrease in our average construction-in-progress during 2016 as compared with 2015 .\nInvestment Income\nInvestment income is recorded within our Investments and Other reportable segment. Investment income increased during 2017 as compared with 2016 primarily due to earnings from our investment in the Advantage Joint Venture. Crude oil throughput volumes during 2017 averaged 44 MBbl/d. Investment income was flat for 2016 as compared with 2015.\nIncome Tax Provision\nSee Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 13. Income Taxes for a discussion of the changes in our income tax provision and effective tax rates.\nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP Financial Measure)\nAdjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to net income, net cash provided by (used in) operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income or net cash, and these measures may vary from those of other companies. As a result, our Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures of other companies in our industry.\nFor a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, see Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, below.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before income taxes, net interest expense, depreciation and amortization and unit-based compensation. Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, industry analysts, lenders and ratings agencies, to assess:\n \u2022 our operating performance as compared with those of other companies in the midstream energy industry, without regard to financing methods, historical cost basis or capital structure; \n \u2022 the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to our partners; \n \u2022 our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and \n \u2022 the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.  We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA provides information useful to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA are net income and net cash provided by operating activities. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure as reported in accordance with GAAP.\nDistributable Cash Flow (Non-GAAP Financial Measure)\nDistributable cash flow should not be considered an alternative to net income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Distributable cash flow excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income or net cash provided by operating activities, and these measures may vary from those of other companies. As a result, our distributable cash flow may not be comparable to similar measures of other companies in our industry.\nFor a a reconciliation of distributable cash flow to its most comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, see Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, below.\nWe define distributable cash flow as Adjusted EBITDA less estimated maintenance capital expenditures and cash interest paid. Distributable cash flow does not reflect changes in working capital balances. Our partnership agreement requires us to distribute all available cash on a quarterly basis, and distributable cash flow is one of the factors used by the board of directors of our General Partner to help determine the amount of cash that is available to our unitholders for a given period. Therefore, we believe distributable cash flow provides information useful to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to distributable cash flow are net income and net cash provided by operating activities. Distributable cash flow should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure as reported in accordance with GAAP.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe following tables present reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow to net income and net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, for each of the periods indicated.\nReconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow\n\nReconciliation of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow\n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nFinancing Strategy\nOur primary source of liquidity is cash flows generated from operations based on commercial agreements with Noble and an unaffiliated third party. We expect our ongoing sources of liquidity to include cash generated from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and issuances of additional equity or debt securities. We believe that cash generated from these sources will be sufficient to meet our short-term working capital requirements and long-term capital expenditure requirements and to make quarterly cash distributions. We do not have any commitment from Noble or our General Partner or any of their respective affiliates to fund our cash flow deficits or provide other direct or indirect financial assistance to us. Certain consolidated subsidiaries make distributions to or receive contributions from Noble in proportion to Noble's ownership in such subsidiary.\nOur partnership agreement requires that we distribute all of our available cash to our unitholders. As a result, we expect to rely primarily upon external financing sources, including our revolving credit facility and the issuance of debt and equity securities, to fund acquisitions and our expansion capital expenditures.\nDuring 2017, we utilized external financing sources to fund portions of our construction activities, the Advantage acquisition, and the cash consideration for the Contributed Assets as well as to make repayments on our revolving credit facility. Our external financing sources consisted of the Private Placement, the Unit Offering and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1. Organization and Nature of Operations and see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6. Long-Term Debt.\nAvailable Liquidity\nYear-end liquidity was as follows:\n\n (1) See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6. Long-Term Debt and See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 14. Subsequent Events.  Cash Flows\nSummary cash flow information was as follows: \nNet cash provided by operating activities increased during 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to an increase in net income driven by increased revenues resulting from higher throughput volumes due to expansion of existing system and providing services to new areas and customers.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased during 2016 as compared with 2015 primarily due to an increase in net income driven by increased revenues resulting from higher throughput volumes partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable resulting from the timing of cash disbursements.\nCash used in investing activities increased during 2017 compared with 2016. Additions to property, plant and equipment were higher in 2017 primarily due to the construction of the Greeley Crescent gathering and fresh water delivery system as well as construction of the Delaware Basin gathering system. Additions to investments were also higher in 2017 due to our investment in the Advantage Joint Venture.\nCash used in investing activities decreased during 2016 as compared with 2015. Additions to property, plant and equipment were higher in 2015 primarily due to construction of East Pony crude oil gathering infrastructure and expansion of the Wells Ranch CGF, which were placed into service at the end of the first quarter of 2015.\nCash provided by financing activities increased during 2017 as compared with 2016. During 2017, our primary financing activities consisted of net borrowings under our revolving credit facility ($85 million), net proceeds from offerings ($312.6 million), contributions from noncontrolling interest owners ($105.9 million), a distribution to Noble for the cash consideration paid for the Contributed Assets ($245.0 million), distributions to our unitholders ($59.9 million), and distributions to noncontrolling interest owners ($21.7 million). During 2016, our primary financing activities consisted cash distributions to our Parent ($42.5 million), proceeds from the IPO of common units ($300.6 million), distributions to Noble subsequent to the IPO ($296.8 million), and distributions to noncontrolling interests ($10.1 million). The increase is primarily due to increased contributions from noncontrolling interest owners and net borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\nDuring 2015, our sole financing activity was a cash contribution from our Parent ($11.7 million).\nRevolving Credit Facility\nOn September 20, 2016, we entered into a credit agreement for a $350 million revolving credit facility. The borrowing capacity on the revolving credit facility may be increased by an additional $350 million subject to certain conditions including compliance with the covenants contained in the credit agreement and requisite commitments from existing or new lenders. The revolving credit facility is available to fund working capital and to finance acquisitions and expansion capital expenditures. As of December 31, 2017, $85 million was outstanding under our revolving credit facility. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6. Long-Term Debt.\nCapital Leases\nWe may also enter into capital lease arrangements for property or equipment to be used in our business. During third quarter 2016, we entered into a capital lease for a pond to be used in our fresh water delivery system. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have not entered into any transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements that would result in off-balance sheet liabilities.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes certain contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 that are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets and/or disclosed in the accompanying notes. \n (1) Annual general and administrative fee we pay to Noble for certain administrative and operational support services being provided to us. The annual general and administrative fee cannot be increased until after the third anniversary of the IPO and will be redetermined annually thereafter. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 3. Transactions with Affiliates. \n (2) Purchase obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable, are legally binding and specify all significant terms, including fixed and minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The amount represents our obligations to materials for use in our capital projects. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies. \n (3) Asset Retirement Obligations are discounted. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 7. Asset Retirement Obligations. \n (4) Annual capital lease payments exclude regular maintenance and operational costs. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies. \n (5) Commitment fee associated with the unused portion of the revolving credit facility. The fee assumes unused capacity of $350 million for all periods presented with no borrowing capacity increases. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6. Long-Term Debt. \n (6) Surface lease obligations represent annual payments to landowners. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies.  Capital Requirements\nCapital Expenditures and Planned Capital Expenditures\nThe midstream energy business is capital intensive, requiring the maintenance of existing gathering systems and other midstream assets and facilities and the acquisition or construction and development of new gathering systems and other midstream assets and facilities. Based on the nature of the expenditure, we categorize our capital expenditures as either:\n \u2022 maintenance capital expenditures, which are additions to property, plant and equipment made to maintain, over the long term, our production and/or operating income. We use an estimate of maintenance capital expenditures to determine our operating surplus, for purposes of determining cash available for distributions; or \n \u2022 expansion capital expenditures, which are additions to property, plant and equipment made to construct new midstream infrastructure and those expenditures incurred in order to extend the useful lives of our assets, reduce costs, increase revenues or increase system throughput or capacity from current levels, including well connections that increase existing system throughput.  Our planned expansion capital expenditures, driven primarily by Noble's planned well completions and production growth on our dedicated acreage, will consist primarily of well connections and gathering line additions. We expect to fund at least a portion of future expansion capital expenditures with borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We expect our maintenance capital expenditures to be funded primarily from cash flows from operations.\nCapital expenditures and other investing activities (on an accrual basis) were as follows: \nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, gathering system expenditures were primarily associated with the construction of the Greeley Crescent, Delaware Basin and Mustang gathering systems, expansion of the Wells Ranch gathering system and construction of the connection from the Billy Miner I CGF in the Delaware Basin to the Advantage pipeline. Fresh water delivery system expenditures were primarily associated with the construction of the Greeley Crescent fresh water delivery system and expansion of the Mustang fresh water delivery system.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, gathering asset expenditures were primarily associated with the construction of the Greeley Crescent, Mustang, and Delaware Basin gathering systems, as well as expansion of the Wells Ranch gathering system. Fresh water delivery system expenditures were primarily related to the expansion of the Wells Ranch, Mustang and East Pony fresh water delivery systems as well as the construction of the Greeley Crescent fresh water delivery system.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, gathering system expenditures were primarily associated with the construction of the East Pony crude oil gathering system and expansion of the Wells Ranch CGF. Fresh water delivery system expenditures were primarily related to the construction of the Mustang fresh water delivery system and expansion of the Wells Ranch fresh water delivery system.\nThe investment in our White Cliffs Interest was related to our share of the funding for an expansion of the pipeline's crude oil capacity to approximately 215,000 Bbl/d. The expansion was completed during second quarter 2016.\nCash Distributions\nOur partnership agreement requires that we distribute all of our available cash quarterly. Under our current cash distribution policy, we intend to make distributions of at least the minimum quarterly distribution of $0.375 per unit for each whole quarter, or $1.50 per unit on an annualized basis, to the holders of our Common and Subordinated Units to the extent we have sufficient available cash after the establishment of cash reserves and the payment of costs and expenses, including reimbursements of expenses to our General Partner. Quarterly distributions, if any, will be made within 45 days after the end of each calendar quarter to holders of record on the applicable record date.\nOn January 25, 2018, the board of directors of our General Partner declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.4883 per limited partner unit. The distribution was paid on February 12, 2018, to unitholders of record on February 5, 2018. Also on February 12, 2018, a cash distribution of $0.5 million was paid to Noble related to its IDRs, based upon the level of distribution paid per Common and Subordinated Unit.\nFor future quarters, the minimum quarterly distribution of $0.375 per unit equates to $14.9 million per quarter, or $59.4 million million per year, based on the number of Common and Subordinated Units outstanding as of December 31, 2017.\nWe expect that if we are successful in executing our business strategy, we will grow our business in a steady and sustainable manner and distribute to our unitholders a portion of any increase in our cash available for distribution resulting from such growth. We expect our general partner may cause us to establish reserves for specific purposes, such as major capital expenditures or debt service payments, or may choose to generally reserve cash in the form of excess distribution coverage from time to time for the purpose of maintaining stability or growth in our quarterly distributions. In addition, our general partner may cause us to borrow amounts to fund distributions in quarters when we generate less cash than is necessary to sustain or grow our cash distributions per unit. Our cash distribution policy reflects a judgment that our unitholders will be better served by our distributing rather than retaining our cash available for distribution. The board of directors of our General Partner has considerable discretion to determine the amount of our available cash each quarter. In addition, the board of directors of our General Partner may change our cash distribution policy at any time.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires our management to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. When alternatives exist among various accounting methods, the choice of accounting method can have a significant impact on reported amounts. The following is a discussion of the accounting policies, estimates and judgments which management believes are most significant in the application of U.S. GAAP used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost upon acquisition. Expenditures which extend the useful lives of existing property, plant and equipment are capitalized. We capitalize construction-related direct labor and incremental costs, while repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.\nWhen properties are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts and any profit or loss on disposition is recognized as gain or loss.\nWe use the straight line method for computing depreciation on our long-lived assets. The determination of estimated useful lives is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations. If the useful lives of the assets were found to be shorter than originally estimated, depreciation and amortization charges would be accelerated.\nAn alternative method of computing depreciation expense is the units-of-production method which, in our case, would generally have been based on throughput volumes. If we had used the units-of-production method, our financial position and results of operations could have been significantly different. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4. Property, Plant and Equipment.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets Property, plant and equipment are generally stated at the lower of historical cost less accumulated depreciation or fair value, if impaired. Property, plant and equipment balances are evaluated for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable from expected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset. If the carrying amount of the asset is not expected to be recoverable from future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment may be recognized. Any impairment is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair value.\nIn assessing long-lived assets for impairments, our management evaluates changes in our business and economic conditions and their implications for recoverability of the assets' carrying amounts. A substantial portion of our revenues arise from services provided to Noble. Therefore, significant downward revisions in reserve estimates or changes in future development plans by Noble, to the extent they affect our operations, may necessitate assessment of the carrying amount of our affected assets for recoverability.\nSuch assessment requires application of judgment regarding the use and ultimate disposition of the asset, long-range revenue and expense estimates, global and regional economic conditions, including commodity prices and drilling activity by our customers, as well as other factors affecting estimated future net cash flows. The measure of impairments to be recognized, if any, depends upon management's estimate of the asset's fair value, which may be determined based on the estimates of future net cash flows or values at which similar assets were transferred in the market in recent transactions, if such data is available. There have been no long-lived asset impairments. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4. Property, Plant and Equipment.\nAsset Retirement Obligations Our asset retirement obligations (ARO) consist of estimated costs of dismantlement, removal, site reclamation and similar activities associated with our infrastructure assets. We recognize the fair value of a liability for an ARO in the period in which it is incurred, when we have an existing legal obligation associated with the retirement of our infrastructure assets and the obligation can reasonably be estimated. The associated asset retirement cost is capitalized as part of the carrying cost of the infrastructure asset. The recognition of an ARO requires that management make numerous estimates, assumptions and judgments regarding such factors as: the existence of a legal obligation for an ARO, estimated probabilities, amounts and timing of settlements, the credit-adjusted risk-free rate to be used, and inflation rates.\nIn periods subsequent to initial measurement of the ARO, we recognize period-to-period changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows. Revisions also result in increases or decreases in the carrying cost of the asset. Increases in the ARO liability due to passage of time impact net income as accretion expense. The related capitalized cost, including revisions thereto, is charged to expense through depreciation and amortization. Asset retirement obligations totaled $10.4 million at December 31, 2017.
