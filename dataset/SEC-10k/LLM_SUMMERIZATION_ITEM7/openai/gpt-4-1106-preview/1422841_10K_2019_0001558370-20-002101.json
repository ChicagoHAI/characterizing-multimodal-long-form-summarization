Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the section titled Selected Consolidated Financial Data\u201d and financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that\ncould cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nAquaVenture Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries (the Company\u201d, AquaVenture\u201d, we\u201d, us\u201d and our\u201d) is a multinational provider of Water-as-a-Service\u00ae, or WAAS\u00ae, solutions that provide our customers with a reliable and cost-effective source of clean drinking water, processed water and wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions primarily under long-term contracts that minimize capital investment by the customer. We believe our WAAS business model offers a differentiated value proposition that generates long-term customer relationships, recurring revenue, predictable cash flow and attractive rates of return. We generate revenue from our operations in North America, the Caribbean and South America and are pursuing expansion opportunities in North America, the Caribbean, South America, Africa, the Middle East and other select markets.\nWe deliver our WAAS solutions through two operating platforms: Seven Seas Water and Quench. Seven Seas Water is a multinational provider of desalination, wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions to governmental, municipal (including utility districts), industrial, property developer and hospitality customers. Our desalination solutions provide more than 8.5 billion gallons per year of potable, high purity industrial grade and ultra-pure water (which is water that is treated to meet higher purity standards required for industrial, semiconductor, utility or pharmaceutical applications). Our wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions, which include plants ranging in capacity from 5,000 gallons per day, or GPD, to more than 1.5 million GPD, are provided through 105 leases with customers as well as through the sale of equipment. Quench, is a U.S.-based provider of Point-of-Use, or POU, filtered water systems and related services through direct and indirect sales channels to approximately 60,000 institutional and commercial customers, including more than half of the Fortune 500, throughout the United States and Canada.\nOur Seven Seas Water platform generates recurring revenue through long-term contracts for our desalination and wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the significant majority of our Seven Seas Water revenue is derived from our desalination solutions in six different locations:\nTable 128: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThe USVI: Seven Seas Water provides all of the municipal potable water needs for the islands of St. Croix, St. Thomas and St. John through its two seawater desalination plants, one on St. Croix and one on St. Thomas, having a combined capacity of approximately 7.0 million GPD. We also provide ultrapure water for use in power generation units by further processing a portion of the potable water we produce for certain of our customers.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSt. Maarten: Seven Seas Water is the primary supplier of municipal potable water needs for St. Maarten through its three seawater desalination plants, which have a combined capacity of approximately 5.8 million GPD.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCura\u00e7ao: Seven Seas Water provided industrial grade water through seawater and brackish water desalination facilities having a combined capacity of approximately 4.9 million GPD.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 131: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTrinidad: Seven Seas Water provides potable water to southern Trinidad through its seawater desalination plant having a capacity of approximately 5.5 million GPD.

( ADB\u201d) and all the rights and obligations under a design and construction contract for a desalination plant and related infrastructure located in Peru (the Peru Acquisition\u201d) on October 31, 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn June 28, 2019, we received formal notice from Cura\u00e7ao Refinery Utilities B.V. ( CRU\u201d) that it is exercising its right to purchase our desalination facilities pursuant to the terms of the existing water supply agreement. The existing water supply agreement with CRU began in December 2008, with the Company providing water from a desalination plant with an initial design capacity of 0.5 million gallons per day under a five-year contract. This agreement has been amended several times, resulting in both expanded water production to the current design capacity of 4.9 million GPD and an extended contract expiration date of December 31, 2019. Pursuant to the terms of the water supply agreement, the applicable buy-out amount, upon consummation of the buyout right by CRU, was $3.5 million due upon the contract expiration date of December 31, 2019. On December 31, 2019, CRU consummated the execution of its buy-out right, and the Company received a cash payment of $3.5 million.\nThrough our Seven Seas Water wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions, we design, fabricate and install plants that are leased under a contractual term or sold to customers. The wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions offered to customers include scalable modular treatment plants, field-erected plants and temporary bypass plants ranging from 5,000 GPD to more than 1.5 million GPD. These solutions are provided through 105 leases with customers. With the November 1, 2018 AUC Acquisition, in which we acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of AUC pursuant to a membership interest purchase agreement, we significantly increased our wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions, which has contributed significantly to our Seven Seas Water revenues.\nWe are supported by operations centers in Tampa, Florida and Houston, Texas, which provides business development, engineering, field service support, procurement, accounting, finance and other administrative functions.\nOur Quench platform generates recurring revenue from the rental and servicing of POU water filtration systems and related equipment, such as ice and sparkling water machines, and from the contracted maintenance of customer owned equipment. Quench also generates revenue from the sale of coffee and consumables under agreements requiring customers to purchase a minimum amount monthly in exchange for the use of a coffee brewer. Our annual unit attrition rate at December 31, 2019 was less than 7.5%, implying an average rental period of more than 12 years. Through our direct sales channel, we receive recurring fees for the units we rent or service throughout the life of our customer relationship. In addition, we also receive non-recurring revenue from some customers for the sale of equipment and for certain services, such as the installation, relocation or removal of equipment. Through our indirect sales channel, we receive re-occurring revenue from the sale of equipment, parts and filters to dealers and retailers. We achieve an attractive return on our rental assets due to strong customer retention. We provide our systems and services to a broad mix of industries, including government, education, medical, manufacturing, retail, and hospitality, among others. We operate principally throughout the United States and Canada and are supported by a primary operations center in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania.\nFor the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, our consolidated revenue was $203.5 million and $145.6 million, respectively. The $57.9 million increase from 2018 to 2019 was primarily due to inclusion of incremental revenues from our acquisitions during 2018 and 2019 in addition to organic growth of existing operations. Including both organic and inorganic growth, our CAGR for revenue was 24.8% from 2014 to 2019.\nAgreement and Plan of Merger\nOn December 23, 2019, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or Merger Agreement, with Culligan International Company, or Culligan, a Delaware corporation, and Amberjack Merger Sub Limited, or Merger Sub, a business incorporated under the laws of the British Virgin Islands and wholly-owned subsidiary of Culligan. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions therein, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the Merger\u201d). As a result of the Merger, the Company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Culligan. The closing of the Merger remains subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the remaining conditions to the Merger set forth in the Merger Agreement. We expect the Merger to close no later than the end of the second quarter of 2020.\n2019 Acquisition Activities\nOn June 1, 2019, we acquired substantially all of the water filtration assets and assumed certain liabilities of Aguaman, Inc. ( Aguaman\u201d), a POU water filtration company based in Miami, Florida, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement. The aggregate purchase price, subject to adjustments, was $1.5 million, which included approximately $1.1 million of cash, $0.2 million payable on the one-year anniversary of the transaction and $0.2 million acquisition contingent\nconsideration payable to the seller on or before the one-year anniversary of the transaction. The assets acquired consist primarily of in-place lease agreements and the related POU systems in the United States.\nOn July 15, 2019, we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Carolina Pure Water Systems, LLC ( Carolina Pure\u201d), a POU water filtration company based in Raleigh, North Carolina, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement. The aggregate purchase price, subject to adjustments, was $7.3 million, which included approximately $6.8 million of cash and $0.5 million payable on the one-year anniversary of the transaction. The assets acquired consist primarily of in-place lease agreements and the related POU systems in the United States.\nOn October 1, 2019, we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Mirex AquaPure Solutions L.P., d/b/a Mirex AquaPure Solutions ( Mirex\u201d), a POU water filtration company based in Houston, Texas, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement. The estimated aggregate purchase price, subject to adjustments, was $11.6 million, which included approximately $10.3 million of cash, $0.9 million payable on the one-year anniversary of the transaction, $0.3 million payable on the two-year anniversary of the transaction and approximately $0.1 million of acquisition contingent consideration. The assets acquired consist primarily of in-place lease agreements and the related POU systems in the United States.\nOn October 1, 2019, we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of 1920277 Alberta Inc., d/b/a Flowline Canada ( Flowline\u201d), a POU water filtration company based in Edmonton, Canada, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement. The estimated aggregate purchase price, subject to adjustments, was $0.9 million, which included approximately $0.8 million of cash and $0.1 million payable on the one-year anniversary of the transaction. The assets acquired consist primarily of in-place lease agreements and the related POU systems in Canada.\nOn December 2, 2019, we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Pure Planet Water, Inc. ( Pure Planet\u201d), a POU water filtration company based in Palm Desert, California, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement. The estimated aggregate purchase price, subject to adjustments, was $0.2 million, which included approximately $0.1 million of cash and $0.1 million payable on the one-year anniversary of the transaction. The assets acquired consist primarily of in-place lease agreements and the related POU systems in the United States.\nOn December 16, 2019, we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Jonli Water Services, Inc. ( Jonli\u201d), a POU water filtration company based in Quebec, Canada pursuant to an asset purchase agreement. The estimated aggregate purchase price, subject to adjustments, was $0.4 million, which was paid in cash. The assets acquired consist primarily of in-place maintenance agreements in Canada.\nWhile we routinely identify and evaluate potential acquisition candidates and engage in discussions and negotiations regarding potential acquisitions, there can be no assurance that any of our discussions or negotiations will result in an acquisition. If we enter into definitive agreements, there can be no assurances that all the conditions precedent to completing those acquisitions will be satisfied or waived, or that the acquisitions will be completed. Further, if we make any acquisitions, there can be no assurance that we will be able to operate or integrate any acquired businesses profitably or otherwise successfully implement our expansion strategy.\nOperating Segments\nWe have two reportable segments that align with our operating platforms, Seven Seas Water and Quench. The segment determination is supported by, among other factors, the existence of individuals responsible for the operations of each segment and who also report directly to our chief operating decision maker ( CODM\u201d), the nature of the segment's operations and information presented to our CODM. For the year ended December 31, 2019, revenues for the Seven Seas Water and Quench segments represented approximately 43% and 57%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues.\nIn addition to the Seven Seas Water and Quench segments, we record certain general and administrative costs that are not allocated to either of the reportable segments within Corporate and Other\u201d for the CODM and for segment reporting purposes. These costs include, but are not limited to, professional service fees and other expenses to support the activities of the registrant holding company. Corporate and Other does not include any labor allocations from the Seven Seas Water and Quench segments. We believe this presentation more accurately portrays the results of the core operations of each of the operating and reportable segments to the CODM. The Corporate and Other administration function is not treated as a segment.\nAs part of the segment reconciliation, intercompany interest expense and the associated intercompany interest income are included but are eliminated in consolidation.\nComponents of Revenues and Expenses\nManagement reviews the results of operations using a variety of measurements and procedures including an analysis of the statements of operations and comprehensive income which management considers an important aspect of our performance analysis. To help the reader better understand the discussion of operating results, details regarding certain line items have been provided below.\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the guidance regarding both revenue from contracts with customers and the determination of the customer in a service concession contract on a full retrospective basis (the Adopted Revenue Guidance\u201d). Several of the Company's contracts were impacted primarily due to the identification of multiple performance obligations within a single contract. However, the Adopted Revenue Guidance did not have a cash impact and, therefore, does not affect the economics of our underlying customer contracts. The adoption did, however, result in differences in the way our revenues, gross profit and net loss are determined compared to historical periods as presented within our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. More specifically, the Adopted Revenue Guidance impacted contracts with customers in our Seven Seas Water segment determined to be service concession arrangements and the classification of financing income. Contracts with customers within the Quench segment remained substantially unchanged.\nFor a discussion on our accounting policies as restated in accordance with the Adopted Revenue Guidance, please refer to Note 2- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenues\nSeven Seas Water\nOur Seven Seas Water business generates revenue from our desalination and wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions provided to governmental, municipal (including utility districts), industrial, property developer and hospitality customers. Revenues from our desalination solutions are primarily generated from contracts with customers to deliver treated bulk water, through both bulk water sales and service and service concession arrangements. Revenues from our wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions are primarily generated from capital and financed equipment sales, and leasing arrangements of up to five years.\nBulk water sales and service, which represent our desalination solutions, can include the delivery of bulk water or bulk water services, including the operations and maintenance of a customer-owned plant. We recognize revenues from the delivery of bulk water or the performance of bulk water services at the time the water or services are delivered to the customers in accordance with the contractual agreements. Certain agreements contain a minimum monthly charge provision which allows the Company to invoice the customer for the greater of the water supplied or a minimum monthly charge. The volume of water supplied is based on meter readings performed at or near the end of the month. Estimates of revenue for unbilled water are recorded when meter readings occur at a time other than the end of a period.\nCertain contracts with customers which require the construction of facilities to provide bulk water to a specific customer contain multiple obligations, including an implicit lease for the bulk water facilities and bulk water services, including operations and maintenance. The implicit lease obligation is generally accounted for as an operating lease as a result of the provisions of the contract. Revenues for contracts with both implicit lease and non-lease components are generally recognized ratably over the contract period as delivered to the customer after taking into consideration our analysis of contingent rent, any minimum take-or-pay provisions and contractual unit pricing.\nService concession arrangements are agreements entered into with a public-sector entity which controls both (i) the ability to modify or approve the services and prices provided by the operating company and (ii) beneficial entitlement to, or residual interest in, the infrastructure at the end of the term of the agreement. Service concession arrangements typically include the construction of infrastructure for the customer and an obligation to provide operations and maintenance on the infrastructure constructed.\nOur wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions generate recurring revenue from the rental of wastewater treatment and water reuse equipment. Our equipment is typically rented under multi-year term, automatically renewing contracts. We record the recurring fees received as revenue for the units we rent ratably throughout the term of each contract period.\nRevenues related to the construction of infrastructure, or product sales revenue, for both our desalination and wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions are recognized over time, using the input method based on cost incurred, which typically begins at the later of commencement of the construction or transfer of control, with revenue being fully recognized upon the completion of the infrastructure as control of the infrastructure is transferred to the customer. Timing differences between when the construction performance obligations are completed and when cash is received from the customer could result in a significant financing component. If a significant financing component is identified, the Company will recognize interest income, or financing revenues, on a long-term receivable established upon the completion of the construction of the infrastructure. Future cash flows received from the customer related to the long-term receivable are bifurcated between the principal repayment of the long-term receivable and the related financing revenue. Revenues related to the operations and maintenance are recognized as revenues as the services are provided to the customer.\nQuench\nOur Quench direct sales channel generates recurring revenue from the rental and servicing of POU water filtration systems and related equipment, such as ice and sparkling water machines, and from the contracted maintenance of customer-owned equipment. In addition, we also receive non-recurring revenue from some customers from the sale of equipment and for certain services, such as the installation, relocation or removal of equipment. Quench also generates revenue from the sale of coffee and consumables. Through our indirect sales channel, we receive re-occurring revenue from the sale of equipment, parts and filters to dealers and retailers.\nThe majority of Quench's direct sales channel customers rent our systems under multi-year, automatically renewing contracts. We record the recurring fees received as revenue for the units we rent ratably throughout the term of each contract period. Non-recurring revenues are recorded at the time services are performed or upon the customer taking control of the equipment and/or products sold.\nCost of Revenues\nSeven Seas Water\nCost of revenues for our Seven Seas Water business consists primarily of the cost of equipment depreciation; cost of equipment constructed for sale; and costs for operating and maintaining equipment on behalf of the customer. Expenditures in connection with the installation of our leased equipment are capitalized as contract fulfillment costs and depreciated to cost of revenues over the estimated useful life of the contract.\nEquipment depreciation is the largest component of our cost of revenues. In the future, we expect that our depreciation and cost of revenue will increase with the addition of new equipment and future acquisitions. Equipment depreciation is calculated using a straight-line method with an allowance for estimated residual values. Depreciation rates are determined based on the estimated useful lives of the assets. Depreciation commences when the equipment is placed into service.\nEquipment construction related to product sales revenue can include the cost of equipment and related installation services, including construction labor costs, field engineering costs, and third-party services. Such expenses can vary depending on the size of the desalination or wastewater plant or the complexity of the application, number of projects and the prevailing labor market for the level of employees needed in the jurisdiction where the plant is being constructed.\nOperating costs for operating and maintaining the equipment on behalf of the customer, which is primarily related to our desalination solutions, includes personnel costs (including compensation and other related personnel costs for employees), electric power, repairs and maintenance, personnel and travel costs for field engineering services and the cost of consumables. Labor costs are generally consistent within a normal range of plant production but can vary from\nplant to plant depending on the size of the plant and the complexity of the water application. Costs of labor can vary depending on the prevailing labor market for the level of employees needed in the jurisdiction where the plant is located.\nElectrical power for our large plants is generally provided by the customer or charged by us to the customer as a pass-through cost; however, our contracts normally require us to maintain electrical usage at or below a specified level of kilowatt hours for each gallon of water produced.\nExpenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred whereas betterments for property, plant and equipment owned by us that add capacity, significantly improve operating efficiency or extend the asset life are capitalized.\nField engineering services include mainly the cost of labor and travel for our specially trained and skilled employees who handle more complex maintenance tasks and to troubleshoot performance issues with our plant equipment and systems. Such expenses can vary depending on the number of projects and the time and extent of the maintenance requirements.\nConsumables are typically chemical additives used in the pre- and post-production processes to meet the water quality and attribute specifications of our customers.\nQuench\nCost of revenues for our Quench business consists primarily of the cost of personnel and travel for our field service, supply chain and technician scheduling and dispatch teams; depreciation of rental equipment and field service vehicles; the cost of equipment purchased or manufactured for resale; the cost of coffee and related consumables; the cost of filters and repair parts; and freight costs. Expenditures incurred in connection with the installation of our rental equipment are capitalized and depreciated to cost of revenues over their estimated useful life.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nEach segment reports the selling, general and administrative expenses that pertain to its business. General and administrative costs that are not allocated to either of the reportable segments are reported in Corporate and Other\u201d for the CODM and for segment reporting purposes. These costs include, but are not limited to, professional service fees and other expenses to support the activities of the registrant holding company. Corporate and Other does not include any labor allocations from the Seven Seas Water and Quench segments. We believe this presentation more accurately portrays the results of the core operations of each of the operating and reportable segments to the CODM. The Corporate and Other administration function is not treated as a segment.\nSeven Seas Water\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for Seven Seas Water consist primarily of compensation and benefits (including salaries, benefits and share-based compensation), third-party professional service fees and travel. Such expenses include personnel and travel costs of our business development organization, third party and internal engineering costs incurred in connection with new project feasibility studies or proposals, and costs for operating business development offices and activities. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include personnel and related costs for our executive, engineering, procurement, finance and human resources organizations and other administrative employees; third party professional service fees for consulting, legal, accounting and tax services; depreciation of office equipment and improvements and computer systems and software not directly related to specific revenue generating projects; amortization expense associated with intangible assets acquired in connection with business combinations, which are amortized over their expected useful lives; and other corporate expenses. In the future, we expect that our selling, general and administrative expenses will increase due to business development efforts in new markets and the general infrastructure to support our future growth.\nQuench\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for Quench include costs related to our selling and marketing functions as well as general and administrative costs associated with our operations center and operating locations, including information systems, finance, customer care, and human resources. Such costs include personnel costs\n(including salaries, benefits and share-based compensation), non-capitalized commissions, amortization of deferred lease costs, expenses related to lead generation, amortization expense associated with intangible assets acquired in connection with business combinations, which are amortized over their expected useful lives, fees for third-party professional services (including consulting, legal, accounting and tax services), travel, depreciation of non-service equipment and other administrative expenses.\nOther Expense and Income\nOther expense and income consists mainly of interest expense and interest income. Interest expense primarily relates to bank and private lender debt. In the future, we expect that our interest expense will increase as a result of the use of debt financing to support our organic and inorganic growth. Interest income primarily relates to interest received on certain cash and cash equivalent investments of three months or less.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Performance and Comparability of Results\nA number of key factors have affected and will continue to affect our performance and the comparison of our operating results, including matters discussed below and those items described in the section entitled Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSeven Seas Water\nThe financial performance of our Seven Seas Water business has been, and will continue to be, significantly affected by our ability to identify and consummate acquisitions of, or to identify and secure new projects for, desalination, wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions with new and existing governmental, municipal, industrial, property developer and hospitality customers. Our performance and the comparability of results over time are largely driven by the timing of events such as acquisitions of existing plants, securing new plant projects (including bulk water sales and service), rental agreements and product sales, plant expansions, and the extension, termination or expiration of water supply agreements and rental agreements for wastewater treatment and water reuse equipment. The timing of many of these events is unpredictable. New plant projects, plant expansions and plant acquisitions, when they do occur, may require significant levels of cash and company resources before and after the commencement of revenue and their impact on our results of operations can be significant.\nThe table below summarizes significant events in 2019 and 2018 that affect the performance and comparability of financial results for these and future periods:\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCapacity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCommencement\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPlant Name\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLocation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEvent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nGPD)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPoint Blanche\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSt. Maarten\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nContract amendment (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nN/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nApril 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAnguilla\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAnguilla\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPlant acquisition\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOctober 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAnguilla\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAnguilla\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPlant expansion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMarch 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLimetree Bay Terminal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSt. Croix\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNew contract with expansion (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNovember 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCRU Refinery\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCura\u00e7ao\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nContract expiration (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nN/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 135: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEffective April 1, 2018, we entered into an amendment to the water purchase agreement in St. Maarten. The amendment reduced the required minimum monthly water purchase by our customer, in exchange for a four-year extension to the water contract. The reduction in the required minimum monthly water purchase will remain in effect for three years, after which time the average monthly minimum purchase will then revert to previous minimum requirements for the remainder of the contract. Our customer has the option to extend the lower minimum volumes for an additional two years, which, if exercised, would also extend the contract expiry from 2025 to 2027.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 136: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEffective November 1, 2019, we terminated our original agreement in St. Croix and subsequently entered new agreement with the customer.

The applicable buy-out amount, upon consummation of the buyout right, is $3.5 million due upon the contract expiration date. On December 31, 2019, CRU consummated the execution of its buy-out right and the Company received a cash payment of $3.5 million. This payment was recorded as a gain on sale of property, plant and equipment, which is reflected within SG&A in our Seven Seas Water segment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to the table above, we also acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of AUC on November 1, 2018. The acquired wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions, which include plants ranging in capacity from 5,000 GPD to more than 1.5 million GPD, are provided through 105 leases with customers.\nTime and Expense Associated with New Business Development\nThe period of time required to develop an opportunity and secure an award can be lengthy, historically taking multiple years during which significant amounts of business development expense may be incurred. Our business development organization seeks to identify new project opportunities for both competitive bid situations and through unsolicited negotiated arrangements. Governmental water customers generally require a competitive bid for new plant development. Participation in a formal bid process and in negotiated arrangements can require significant costs, the timing of which can impact the comparability of our financial results. While our proposed pricing factors in such costs, there is no assurance that we will secure the contract and ultimately recover our costs.\nThe period from contract award to the commissioning of a new plant (and commencement of revenues) can also vary greatly due to, among other things, the size and complexity of the plant. In the case of a newly constructed desalination plant, there is typically a ramp-up period during which the plant operates below normal capacity.\nExisting Customer Relationships\nWe expect to continue to grow our business with existing customers by expanding and extending the contractual term for existing plants to meet an expected increase in customer demand, each of which will impact our performance and comparability of results. As customer demand increases for either the volume of water produced and delivered or the wastewater treated, we typically experience increased sales volume through the use of additional capacity built into existing desalination plants or through the renegotiation of an existing contract and deployment of\nincremental equipment to meet customer demands. Similarly, contract extensions and renewals provide economic benefits for both the customer and us. By the time we enter into an extension or renewal we have typically recovered meaningful portions of our capital investment and only incremental capital investment may be required. These factors provide a competitive advantage in a contract extension (or renewal) process and may enable us to reduce unit prices, sustain profitability and achieve an improved and continuing return on our invested capital.\nAcquisition of Existing Assets or Business\nRevenue and expenses will increase upon an acquisition of existing assets or businesses from a third party. In addition, the time, cost and capital required to complete an acquisition are significant. Specifically, the costs incurred prior to the acquisition can include professional fees, travel costs and, in certain instances, success fees paid to third parties. These costs may be incurred well in advance of the completion of an acquisition. Upon completion of the acquisition, certain assets, including desalination plants, may experience periods of downtime or reduced production levels as well as additional capital investment while we bring the plant up to our engineering and operating standards. Acquisitions are a part of our Seven Seas Water growth strategy and accordingly our ability to grow could be impacted by our effectiveness in completing and integrating our acquisitions.\nEntry into New Markets\nOur future performance will be affected by our investment and success in securing business in new markets. While continuing to penetrate the Caribbean market, we have also expanded our business development efforts to pursue a global business footprint in North America, South America, Africa, the Middle East and other select markets. As we continue to pursue entry into new markets, we may incur increasing expenses for business development that may be sustained for long periods of time before realizing the benefit of incremental revenues. In addition, our entry into some new markets may be better served through partnering arrangements such as joint ventures, which may result in a minority position. Such an arrangement may be economically attractive even though, in some circumstances, we may not be able to consolidate the operating results of a partnering arrangement with our own operating results.\nChanges to Sales Volume, Costs of Sales and Operating Expenses\nFor our desalination solutions, our profitability is affected by changes in the volume of water delivered above any minimum required customer purchases, our ability to control plant production costs, and our ability to control equipment manufacturing costs and operating expenses. For our wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions, our profitability is affected by the number and profitability of construction projects commenced and completed during the period and the number of new leases entered into with customers.\nDue to the capital-intensive nature of our desalination solutions and the relatively high level of fixed costs such as depreciation and contract cost amortization, our Seven Seas Water business model is characterized by high levels of operating leverage. As a result, significant swings in bulk water production volume could favorably or unfavorably impact profitability more significantly than business models with less operating leverage. We have mitigated the downside risk of declines in bulk water plant production through the inclusion of minimum customer purchase requirements in a majority of our eight water supply contracts with our major customers. In the other two water supply contracts, we have contractual rights to be the exclusive water supplier or our customer must purchase all the water we produce and we must provide volume at a specified percentage of installed capacity. We design our plants to meet or exceed contractual supply requirements but our failure to meet minimum supply requirements could result in penalties that may adversely affect our financial performance.\nOperating costs for our desalination solutions can have a significant impact on the profitability of our operations. Electrical costs are a major expense in connection with the operation of a water treatment plant. Our major customers either, directly or through related parties, provide the electricity needed to run the plant without cost to us or reimburse us for this cost on a pass-through basis. In general, our contracts require us to maintain electrical usage at or below a specified level of kilowatt hours for each gallon of water produced. As a result, our cost risk is principally with respect to our ability to use electrical power efficiently. We have made investments in plant equipment and configuration to maintain required levels of electrical efficiency.\nPersonnel costs are another major cost element for plant operations. Our contracts provide for price adjustments based on inflation. Profitability, however, could be adversely affected by significant increases in market prices for labor, social taxes and benefits or changes in operations requiring additional personnel.\nRepairs and maintenance can be a significant cost of the business. Because we assume the responsibility to operate and maintain our desalination plants over a long period of time, we use plant designs and equipment that seek to minimize repairs and maintenance and optimize long-term performance. We may however, from time to time experience equipment failures outside of warranty coverage which could result in significant costs to repair.\nOur operations centers in Tampa, Florida and Houston, Texas incur significant selling, general and administrative expenses that are intended to support our plans for future growth. Certain of these expenses, in particular those related to business development, are largely discretionary and not correlated specifically to short-term changes in revenue. Direct engineering cost, including allocated overhead, for personnel at our operations centers are capitalized as a project cost based on hours incurred on active plant construction projects which can change from period to period. The timing of new hires, the utilization of engineering personnel and the spending in these areas may affect the comparability of our results.\nContractually Scheduled and Negotiated Changes to Terms and Conditions\nOur Seven Seas Water business is conducted in accordance with the terms of long-term water supply contracts that, among other things, may provide for minimum customer purchases, guaranteed supply volumes and specified levels of pricing based on the volume of water purchased during the billing period. These contractual features are key determinants of plant revenue and plant profitability. Certain of our contracts provide for contractually scheduled price changes. In addition, our contracts may include provisions to increase prices in accordance with a specified inflation index such as the consumer price index. From time to time, we may also negotiate pricing changes with our customers as part of an arrangement to, among other things, extend or renew a contract or increase capacity by expanding the plant.\nRevenues and operating income can be expected to decrease, potentially by a significant amount, upon a decrease in contracted services or contract renegotiation, termination or expiration.\nCustomer Demand and Certain Other External Factors\nFor our desalination solutions, we design plant capacity to exceed the minimum purchase requirements contained in our contracts to meet anticipated customer needs and maintain sufficient excess capacity. Our customer's water demand and our ability to meet that demand can vary among quarters and annual periods for a variety of reasons over which we have little control, including:\nTable 138: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe timing and length of shutdowns of customer facilities or infrastructure due to factors such as equipment failures, power outages, regular scheduled maintenance and severe weather which can adversely affect customer demand;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nseasonal fluctuations or downturns in the general economy can be expected to adversely affect demand from customers for whom tourism is a significant economic driver, including our municipal or resort customers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\neconomic cycles may affect the industrial customers we serve, especially those in the energy and mining sectors where volatility in commodity prices or consolidation of capacity could adversely affect customer demand;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nexcessive periods of rain or drought can impact primary demand;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ndestruction caused by floods, tropical storms and hurricanes which can impact primary demand as well as cause delays in collections from our customers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe non-renewal of contracts by customers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nvarious environmental factors and natural or man-made conditions impacting the quality of source water, such as bacteria levels or contaminants in source water, can require additional pretreatment thus adding cost and reducing the level of production throughput; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 145: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ntechnological advances especially in new filtration technologies, reverse osmosis membranes, energy recovery equipment and energy efficient plant designs may affect future operating performance and the cost competitiveness of our services in the market.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor our wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions, we utilize a modular design that enables us to expand capacity with increasing customer demand. The plants are designed to treat peak volumes of wastewater produced by our customers. Our customer's demand for our wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions can vary among quarters and annual periods for a variety of reasons over which we have little control, including:\nTable 146: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nindividual developers or customers inability to procure funding to initiate building or expanding certain residential developments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 147: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nresidential development specific construction delays such as weather-related delays, changes in specifications or inability of ancillary contractors to preform works;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 148: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ndownturns in the general economy and housing market that can decrease demand for new housing developments thus limiting increases in demand for wastewater treatment;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 149: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nreplacement of our solutions by a larger, centralized facility or the connecting of customers to a centralized wastewater treatment or water reuse solution; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 150: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\npotential changes in the regulatory environment that could impede development of further decentralized wastewater treatment systems.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nQuench\nAttracting New Customers\nOur performance will be affected by our ability to continue to attract new customers. We believe that the U.S. commercial water cooler market is underpenetrated by POU water filtration, which represented only 11.1% by revenue of a $4.2 billion per year market in 2015. We intend to continue to invest in selling and marketing efforts to attract new customers for our filtered water systems, both within our existing geographic territories and in targeted additional territories in the United States and internationally. Our ability to attract new customers may vary from period to period for several reasons, including the effectiveness of our selling and marketing efforts, our ability to hire and retain salespeople, competitive dynamics, variability in our sales cycle (particularly related to opportunities to serve larger enterprises), the timing of the roll-out of large-enterprise orders and general economic conditions.\nCustomer Relationships\nWe believe that our existing customers continue to provide significant opportunities for us to offer additional products and services. In our direct sales channel, these opportunities include the rental of additional or upgraded water coolers, as well as the rental of equipment from our newer product lines enabled by POU water filtration, such as ice machines, sparkling water coolers and coffee brewers. In addition, we expect to invest to grow the sales of consumables associated with our systems, such as coffee and related consumables, and continue to pursue the resale of equipment to dealers, retailers and end customers who prefer to own, rather than lease, their equipment.\nTypically, we rent our systems to customers on multi-year, automatically-renewing contracts, and we anticipate extending our relationships with existing customers beyond the initial contract term. Some customers terminate their agreements during the agreement term, typically due to financial constraints, and others cancel at the end of the term. Our annual unit attrition rate at December 31, 2019 was less than 7.5%, implying an average rental period of more than 12 years. Our ability to retain our existing customer relationships will affect our performance and is affected by a number of factors, including the effectiveness of our retention efforts, the quality of our products and service, our pricing, competitive dynamics in the industry, product availability, and the health of the economy. In addition, the non-\nrecurring revenue from the sale of equipment, coffee and consumables, is less predictable and can change based on fluctuations in demand in a specific period.\nStrategic Acquisitions\nThe POU water filtration industry is highly fragmented, with a large number of local competitors and several larger regional operators. Quench has completed 20 acquisitions since our initial public offering, of which 8 have occurred since the beginning of 2019. We believe our recent acquisition activity is indicative of the opportunity for future inorganic growth.\nThrough our indirect sales channel, we offer POU systems to networks of approximately 260 dealers and retailers predominantly in North America. The indirect sales channel expands our participation in the growing POU market domestically and internationally. In addition, the channel enhances our ability to develop, source and manufacture innovative, exclusive coolers and purification offerings. Lastly, the channel offers us the opportunity to develop deeper relationships with POU dealers that could lead to future acquisitions.\nWe expect to continue to pursue select acquisitions to increase our scale, customer density and geographic service area, as well as to increase our participation in the broader international market for POU systems. Our ability to complete acquisitions is a function of many factors, including competition, purchase price and our short-term business priorities. Accordingly, it is impossible to predict whether any current or future discussions will lead to the successful completion of any acquisitions. Since acquisitions are a part of our growth strategy, the inability to complete, integrate and profitably operate acquisitions may adversely affect our operating results.\nChanges to Cost of Sales and Operating Expenses\nProfitability of our Quench platform will be affected by our ability to control our costs of sales and operating expenses.\nA majority of Quench rental agreements are priced at fixed rates for multi-year periods ranging up to four years. As a result, our gross margins are exposed to potential cost of sales increases that cannot be immediately offset by price adjustments. The volume, mix and pricing of equipment and consumables purchased for immediate resale (as opposed to rental) can impact the consistency and comparability of our results. The overall compensation of field service and supply chain support (along with the costs of associated vehicles), may affect our gross margins.\nQuench incurs selling, general and administrative costs to support a North American sales force, a widely dispersed installed base of customers, and a high volume of recurring business transactions. A portion of such costs is composed of new customer acquisition costs, such as lead generation expenses, which are expensed upfront and recovered over the periods following the execution of a customer contract and any subsequent renewal. Commissions and other costs that are directly related to the negotiation and execution of leases, considered contract acquisition costs, are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the contract period. Selling, general and administrative costs also include certain costs to complete business acquisitions, which precede the realization of revenues generated by the acquired new business, and discretionary investments in infrastructure to support our plans for Quench's future long-term growth. The timing of these expenditures and their impact relative to the revenues generated can affect our performance and comparability of results.\nCorporate and Other\nChanges to Operating Expenses\nWe expect to incur increased legal, accounting and other expenses as we pursue our expansion strategy and as a public company, including costs resulting from public company reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act\u201d), and the listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange. We anticipate that such operating costs as a percentage of revenue will moderate over the long-term if and as our revenues increase or as a result of certain other corporate activities or projects.\nPresentation of Financial Information\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). In the preparation of these consolidated financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses and related disclosures. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or operating results would be affected. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates, which we discuss below.\nAdoption of New Accounting Pronouncements\nUnder the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act, we meet the definition of an emerging growth company.\u201d We have irrevocably elected to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance regarding implementation of measurement of credit losses on financial instruments. This guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those annual periods, and early adoption is permitted. We adopted this guidance on a modified retrospective basis on January 1, 2019 with the cumulative effect of transition as of the effective date of adoption. For a discussion on the impacts of the authoritative guidance on our financial statements, please refer to Note 2- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn March 2019, the FASB issued authoritative guidance regarding targeted changes to lessor accounting. This guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those annual periods, and early adoption is permitted. We adopted this guidance on a retrospective basis as of January 1, 2019 (the original adoption date of the lease pronouncement). For a discussion on the impacts of the authoritative guidance on our financial statements, please refer to Note 2- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued authoritative guidance regarding leases that requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and right of use asset for operating leases, with the exception of short-term leases. In addition, lessor accounting was modified to align, where necessary, with lessee accounting modifications and the authoritative guidance regarding revenue from contracts with customers. During 2018, the FASB issued additional authoritative guidance which, among other things, provided an option to apply transition provisions under the standard at adoption date rather than the earliest comparative period presented as well as added a practical expedient that would permit lessors to not separate non-lease components from the associated lease components if certain conditions are met. These amendments are effective, in conjunction with the new lease standard, for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those annual periods.\nWe adopted this guidance on a modified retrospective basis on January 1, 2019 with the cumulative effect of transition as of the effective date of adoption. For a discussion on the impacts of the authoritative guidance on our financial statements, please refer to Note 2- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements to be Adopted\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued authoritative guidance regarding implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract. This guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those annual periods, and early adoption is permitted. We adopted this guidance on January 1, 2020 on a prospective basis. Although certain implementation costs we incur going forward may now be capitalizable, there is no material impact expected to the consolidated financial statements as a result of this adoption.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued authoritative guidance regarding fair value measurements. This guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those annual periods, and early adoption is permitted. We adopted this guidance on January 1, 2020 on a prospective basis. Beginning with all periods subsequent to the adoption date, we will prepare the enhanced disclosures within the consolidated financial statements as a result of this adoption.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments used. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. In making estimates and judgments, management employs critical accounting policies.\nOur significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.\nLeases\nLessee accounting\nWe lease space and operating assets, including offices, office equipment, warehouses, storage yards and storage units under non-cancelable operating leases. We account for these leases in accordance with the authoritative guidance adopted as of January 1, 2019. Please see Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements\u201d section above for information regarding this adoption.\nAt contract inception, we determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease. If the arrangement contains a lease, we recognize a right-of-use asset and an operating lease liability at the lease commencement date. Lease expense for lease payments made is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nThe operating lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments at the lease commencement date. The current portion of our operating lease liabilities are recorded within accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which is comprised of the initial amount of the operating lease liability adjusted for lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred less any lease incentives received. The right-of-use asset is subsequently measured throughout the lease term at the carrying amount of the operating lease liability, plus initial direct costs, plus (minus) any prepaid (accrued) lease payments, less the unamortized balance of lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets are periodically reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances arise.\nKey estimates and judgments in determining both the operating lease liability and right-of-use asset include the determination of (i) the discount rate it uses to discount the unpaid lease payments to present value, (ii) the lease term and (iii) the lease payments.\nThe discount rate applied to the unpaid lease payments is the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, our incremental borrowing rate. Generally, we cannot determine the interest rate implicit in the lease because we do not have access to the lessor's estimated residual value or the amount of the lessor's deferred initial direct costs. Therefore, we generally derive an incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate for the lease. Our incremental borrowing rate for a lease is the rate of interest we would have to pay on a collateralized basis to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments under similar terms.\nThe lease term for all of our leases includes the noncancelable period of the lease, plus any additional periods covered by either our option to extend (or not to terminate) the lease that we are reasonably certain to exercise, and/or an option to extend (or not to terminate) the lease controlled by the lessor.\nLease payments included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities are comprised of the following:\nTable 151: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nfixed payments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 152: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nvariable lease payments that depend on an index or rate, initially measured using the index or rate at the lease commencement date; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 153: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe exercise price of our option to purchase the underlying asset if we are reasonably certain to exercise the option.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn certain instances, our leases include non-lease components, such as equipment maintenance or common area maintenance. As part of its adoption of authoritative guidance on leases on January 1, 2019, we have not elected the practical expedient to account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component and have elected (for all classes of underlying assets) to account for these components separately. We have allocated the consideration in the contract to the lease and non-lease components based on each component's relative standalone price. We determine standalone prices for the lease components based on the prices for which other lessors lease similar assets on a standalone basis. We determine standalone prices for the non-lease components based on the prices that suppliers might charge for those type of services on a standalone basis. If observable standalone prices are not readily available, we estimate the standalone prices maximizing the use of observable information.\nWe have elected to utilize the short-term lease exemption and not recognize a right-of-use asset and corresponding operating lease liability for leases with expected terms of 12 months or less. We recognize the lease payments associated with its short-term leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nLessor accounting\nWe generate revenues through the lease of our bulk water facilities, wastewater treatment and water reuse equipment, and filtered water and related systems equipment to customers. In certain instances, we enter into a contract with a customer but must construct the underlying asset, including bulk water facilities and wastewater treatment and water reuse equipment, prior to its lease.\nAt the time of contract inception, we determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease.\nCustomer contracts that contain leases, which can be explicit or implicit in the contract, are generally classified as either operating leases or sales-type leases and can contain both lease and non-lease components, including operating and maintenance services ( O&M\u201d) of the Company-owned equipment. As part of our adoption of authoritative guidance on leases on January 1, 2019, we elected the practical expedient for all classes of underlying assets to not separate the lease and non-lease components if certain conditions are met, including the classification of the lease component as operating and the revenue recognition pattern of both the lease and non-lease components. We will account for the contract with the customer as a combined component under the respective authoritative guidance for the predominant element in the contract, the lease or non-lease component.\nFor leases classified as sales-type leases, we allocate the transaction price based on the relative standalone selling prices of the identified performance obligations.\nIf the customer contract contains or is accounted for as a lease, the key estimates and judgments used in accounting for the lease as a lessor include the following: (i) lease term, (ii) the economic life of the underlying leased\nasset, (iii) determination of lease payments and (iv) determination of the fair value at the time of contract inception and the residual value of the underlying leased asset.\nThe lease term for all of our leases includes the noncancelable period of the lease, plus any additional periods covered by either a lessee option to extend (or not to terminate) the lease that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise, and/or an option to extend (or not to terminate) the lease controlled by us. Contracts entered into with customers can include either the option to renew or an auto-renewing provision that results in the automatic extension of the existing contract. In certain instances, key provisions such as the lease payment and term of the renewal are not stated and are subject to renewal.\nThe economic life of the underlying leased asset is determined to be either the period over which the asset is expected to be economically usable, or where the benefits it can produce exceed the cost to replace or undertake major repairs. In certain instances, the economic life of the underlying leased asset can exceed the useful life we assign.\nLease payments that are accounted for as rental revenue are comprised of the following:\nTable 154: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nfixed payments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 155: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nvariable lease payments that depend on an index or rate, initially measured using the index or rate at the lease commencement date;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 156: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe exercise price of a lessee option to purchase the underlying asset if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise the option; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 157: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\npayments for penalties for the termination of a lease if the term reflects the lessee terminating the lease.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur leases do not typically include a requirement for the customer to guarantee the residual value of the underlying leased asset. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or rate are excluded from the determination of lease payments.\nThe fair value of the underlying leased asset at contract inception and residual value of underlying leased asset at the end of the term of the lease are determined based on the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction at the time of valuation. Our risk management strategy for protecting the residual value of the underlying assets include our ongoing maintenance during the lease term as well as clauses and other protections within the lease agreements which require the lessee to return the underlying asset in working condition at the end of the lease term.\nAt contract inception, we determine the lease classification of the underlying asset. We consider inputs such as the lease term, lease payments, fair value of the underlying asset and residual value of the underlying asset when assessing the classification. The discount rate applied to the unpaid lease payments is the interest rate implicit in the lease. The rate implicit in the lease is the rate of interest that, at a given date, causes the aggregate present value of (a) the lease payments and (b) the amount that the we expect to derive from the underlying asset following the end of the lease term to equal the sum of (1) the fair value of the underlying asset minus any related investment tax credit retained and expected to be realized and (2) any deferred initial direct costs we incur.\nIn certain instances, contracts with customers may also include the option for the customer to purchase the underlying asset at the end of the lease term. When applicable and certain conditions are met, we will incorporate the stated purchase price into the determination of the interest rate implied in the lease.\nRecoverable Amount of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill associated with our business combinations has been and is expected to continue increasing in the future as further acquisitions are completed. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter and more frequently if a change in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicates that potential impairment exists. We first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If it is determined to be more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we perform the quantitative analysis of the goodwill impairment test. Otherwise, the quantitative test is optional.\nUnder the quantitative analysis, the recoverability of goodwill is measured at each reporting unit by comparing the reporting unit's carrying amount, including goodwill, to the fair market value of the reporting unit. We determine the fair market value of our reporting units based on a weighting of the present value of projected future cash flows, which we refer to as the Income Approach, and a comparative market approach under both the guideline company method and guideline transaction method, which we refer to as the Market Approach. Fair market value using the Income Approach is based on our estimated future cash flows on a discounted basis. The Market Approach compares each of our reporting units to other comparable companies based on valuation multiples derived from operational and transactional data to arrive at a fair value. Factors requiring significant judgment include, among others, the determination of comparable companies, assumptions related to forecasted operating results, discount rates, long-term growth rates, and market multiples. Changes in economic or operating conditions, or changes in our business strategies, that occur after the annual impairment analysis and which impact these assumptions, may result in a future goodwill impairment charge, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements.\nIn determining its reporting units, the Company reviews its operating segments to determine the number of components within each segment. If an operating segment contains only a single component, the operating segment is deemed a reporting unit. If an operating segment contains more than one component, the Company aggregates into a single reporting unit those components determined to have similar economic characteristics. Components determined to have dissimilar economic characteristics are considered a separate reporting unit. As of both December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Quench segment was determined to be composed of a single reporting unit. As of both December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Seven Seas Water segment was determined to be composed of two reporting units.\nFor the 2019 and 2018 goodwill impairment assessments, we performed a qualitative assessment of each reporting unit that existed at the time of the impairment assessment. Based upon the qualitative assessments, it was determined that there was substantial evidence that it was more likely than not that the fair value for each reporting unit were more than the carrying values. As such, no quantitative assessment was deemed necessary.\nOther intangible assets consist of certain trade names, customer relationships and non-compete agreements. Intangible assets which have a finite life are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis. Customer relationships which have a finite life are amortized on an accelerated basis based on the projected economic value of the asset over its useful life. Intangible assets with a finite life are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which consist of certain trade names, are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the asset may be impaired. No impairment was recorded during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nBusiness Combinations\nIn accordance with accounting for business combinations, we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill.\nOur purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. Management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices, the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses. Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates.\nThe valuation of net assets acquired in a business combination determines the allocation of purchase price to specific assets and the subsequent recognition of expense. A change in our estimate of the value assigned to intangibles or a change in our estimate of useful life for the intangibles could impact the amount of amortization expense recorded in any period. A 10% change in the amortization expense recorded for the year ended December 31, 2019 would have impacted our pre-tax net loss by approximately $2.3 million.\nIf an acquisition does not meet the definition of a business combination, then we account for the transaction as an asset acquisition. In an asset acquisition, goodwill is not recognized, but rather any excess consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired is allocated on a relative fair value basis to the identifiable net assets. In addition, transaction-related expenses are capitalized and allocated to the net assets acquired on a relative fair value basis.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe account for share-based compensation by measuring the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value. The cost is recognized over the requisite service period, net of adjustments for forfeitures as they occur.\nWe have several equity award plans, including plans which were established prior to the corporate reorganization and IPO and one which became effective upon the effectiveness of the IPO. See Note 12- Share-based Compensation\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a complete discussion on all our equity award plans.\nWe expense the fair value of share-based compensation awards over the requisite service period, which is typically the vesting period. The expense is then adjusted for forfeitures as they occur. We estimate the grant date fair value of options and other equity awards with hurdle rates using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model that requires management to apply judgment and make estimates, including:\nTable 158: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nexpected volatility, which is calculated based on reported volatility data for a representative group of publicly traded companies for which historical information is available.

These judgments and estimates included assumptions regarding our future operating performance, the time to completing an initial public offering, or other liquidity event, the related company valuations associated with such events, and the determinations of the appropriate valuation methods. If we had made different assumptions, our share-based compensation expense and net loss could have been significantly different. A 10% change in share-based compensation expense recorded for the year ended December 31, 2019 would have impacted our pre-tax net loss by approximately $0.5 million.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach to the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. We are required to exercise judgment with respect to the realization of our net deferred tax assets. Management evaluates all positive and negative evidence and exercises judgment regarding past and future events to determine if it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets may not be realized. If appropriate, a valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that\nmay not be realized. We evaluate tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in our tax returns, and we record a liability for uncertain tax positions. We use a two-step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions. First, tax positions are recognized if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. Second, tax positions are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nAquaVenture Holdings Limited is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, which does not impose income taxes. Certain of our subsidiaries file separate tax returns and are subject to federal income taxes at the corporate level in the United States or in foreign jurisdictions. Certain other subsidiaries operate in jurisdictions that do not impose taxes based on income.\nVarious internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable, material or immaterial effects on our effective income tax rate and therefore, impact net income and earnings per share. These factors include, but are not limited to changes in tax rates; changes in tax laws, regulations and rulings; changes in interpretations of existing laws, regulations and rulings; changes in the evaluation of our ability to realize deferred tax assets, and changes in accounting principles; changes in current pre-tax income as well as changes in forecasted pre-tax income; changes in the mix of earnings among countries with different tax rates; and acquisitions and changes in our corporate structure. These factors may result in periodic revisions to our effective income tax rate, which could affect our cash flow and results of operations. We recorded a valuation allowance of $28.5 million as of December 31, 2019 related primarily to net operating losses.\nA 0.50% change in our effective income tax rate would have impacted our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2019 by approximately $0.1 million.\nResults of Operations\nWe have omitted discussion of the earliest of the three years covered by our consolidated financial statements presented in this report because that disclosure was already included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, as amended. You are encouraged to reference Part II, Item 7, within that report, as amended, for a discussion of our financial condition and result of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe operating expenses of the parent, AquaVenture Holdings Limited, are reported separately from the two operating and reportable segments below.

December 31, 2018 through a combination of organic and inorganic growth. In calculating organic and inorganic revenue growth, (i) organic growth represents estimated revenue from operations that existed in both the current and comparable periods, and (ii) inorganic growth includes the estimated revenue from acquisitions for the 12 months following an acquisition and any revenue contributions from divested businesses for the months in the prior year period in which the business did not exist in the current year period.\nSeven Seas Water revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $21.9 million, or 33.0%, compared to the same period of 2018, which were comprised of 31.2% inorganic growth and 1.8% organic growth. Bulk water revenues increased $3.2 million, or 5.6%, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to: (i) increases of $1.4 million from our USVI operations and $0.7 million from our St. Maarten operations due to higher production volumes compared to the same period of 2018; (ii) an increase of $1.3 million in connection with the commencement of our water contract in Anguilla; and (iii) an increase of $0.4 million in our BVI operations driven by increases in the water rate compared to the prior year. This was partially offset by $0.3 million lower revenue in our Peru operations primarily due to revenue received in the prior year in connection with non-routine services performed for the customer. Rental revenues and product sales increased $12.5 million and $6.6 million, respectively, primarily due to the inclusion of the AUC operations which were acquired in November 2018.\nQuench revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $36.0 million, or 45.4%, compared to the same period of 2018, which were comprised of 31.8% of inorganic growth and 13.6% organic growth. The prior year period included $3.5 million of revenue from the Atlas High Purity Solutions business that was divested in October 2018. Rental revenues increased $17.6 million, or 28.4%, compared to the prior year period, which was comprised of 20.5% inorganic net growth from acquisitions and 7.9% of organic growth due to additional units placed under new leases in excess of unit attrition. Product sales increased $18.4 million compared to the prior year, which included $12.8 million of inorganic net growth primarily due to the acquisitions of PHSI and Bluline in December 2018, and $5.6 million of organic growth driven by higher indirect dealer equipment sales and coffee sales.\nGross margin\nThe following table presents the major components of cost of revenues, gross profit and gross margin for our two operating segments:\nTable 166: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPercent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGross Margin:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSeven Seas Water\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBulk water\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n54.2\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n53.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRental\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n67.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n74.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(7.7)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProduct sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n17.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2.5)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFinancing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal Seven Seas Water\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n54.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n55.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1.7)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nQuench\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRental\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n52.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n55.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3.0)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProduct sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n40.2\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n35.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.2\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal Quench\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n48.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n51.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2.4)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal gross margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n51.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n53.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased 210 basis points to 51.1% from 53.2% in the prior year period.\nSeven Seas Water gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased 170 basis points to 54.0% compared to 55.7% in the prior year. Bulk water gross margin of 54.2% increased 50 basis points compared to 53.7% in the prior year primarily due to higher revenues in our BVI and USVI operations without a commensurate increase in costs. This was partially offset by a decrease in gross margin at our Trinidad operations due to a depreciation expense adjustment in the prior year in connection with a purchase price refund received on in-service equipment. Rental gross margin of 67.0% decreased from 74.7% in the prior year primarily due to additional depreciation expense on property, plant and equipment related to the finalization of purchase accounting for the AUC acquisition. Product sales gross margin of 15.0% decreased from 17.5% in the prior year period primarily due to higher contributions from lower-margin contracts compared to the prior year.\nQuench gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased 240 basis points to 48.8% from 51.2% for the same period of 2018. Rental gross margin of 52.7% decreased from 55.7% in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenue related to additional units placed on lease, partially offset by lower compensation and benefits as a percentage of revenues due to continued leveraging of the platform. Product sales gross margin increased to 40.2% for the year ended December 31, 2019 from 35.0% in the prior year, primarily driven by the higher-margin indirect PHSI dealer equipment sales.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nThe following table presents selling, general and administrative, or SG&A, expenses for our operating segments:\nTable 167: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPercent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSeven Seas Water\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n24,974\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n30,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(5,169)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(17.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nQuench\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n59,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n48,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10,910\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n22.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCorporate and Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11,432\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,832\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n136.6\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n95,986\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n83,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n12,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $12.3 million, or 14.8%, compared to the same period of 2018.\nSeven Seas Water SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $5.2 million to $25.0 million compared to the prior year, which was primarily due to (i) a decrease of $4.4 million in share-based compensation expense driven by the completion of the vesting of certain equity grants made in connection with our initial public offering in 2016, (ii) a $3.0 million net gain on sale of property, plant and equipment primarily in connection with our customer in Cura\u00e7ao exercising its right to purchase the desalination facilities pursuant to the water supply agreement, and (iii) $1.6 million of lower professional fees primarily due to elevated costs in the prior year related to the acquisition of the AUC operations in November 2018. Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase of $3.2 million in amortization expense of definite lived intangible assets and $0.3 million higher compensation and benefits expense primarily due to the acquisition of the AUC operations in November 2018. Seven Seas Water SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decline compared to 45.4% for the same period of 2018.\nQuench SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $10.9 million to $59.6 million compared to the prior year. The increase was driven by $6.5 million higher amortization expense primarily related to an increase in intangible assets from recent acquisitions, $4.1 million higher compensation and benefits primarily driven by increased headcount from the inclusion of staff added from certain acquisitions and a $1.3 million increase in general expenses primarily to support the expansion of our operations. Partially offsetting this increase was $1.5 million lower acquisition-related expenses and $0.8 million lower restructuring costs primarily incurred in connection with the PHSI acquisition in December 2018, and a $1.4 million decrease in share-based compensation expense driven by the completion of the vesting of certain equity grants made in connection with our initial public offering in 2016. Quench SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue were 51.7% for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decline compared to 61.5% for the same period of 2018.\nCorporate and Other SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $6.6 million to $11.4 million compared to the same period of 2018, which was driven by $6.6 million of expenses incurred in connection with the definitive merger agreement entered into in December 2019.\nCommencing on December 18, 2018, the Company initiated a restructuring of the PHSI organization which included the reduction of headcount for PHSI executive management and other employee positions determined to be duplicative with those at Quench (the PHSI Restructuring Plan\u201d). Certain of the positions were backfilled with additional positions at Quench depending on the needs of the business. The expected net effect of the restructuring allowed Quench to recognize synergies of reduced employee costs subsequent to the PHSI Acquisition. The restructuring was determined to be a post-combination transaction. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company incurred an incremental restructuring-related charge related to severance, termination benefits and related taxes of $0.1 million and $0.9 million, respectively, which was recorded within SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had accrued approximately $0 and $0.8 million, respectively, within accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company completed the PHSI Restructuring Plan during the second quarter of 2019.\nOther expense\nTable 168: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPercent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(25,386)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(15,046)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(10,340)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n68.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(460)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(850)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(45.9)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal other expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(25,846)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(15,896)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(9,950)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n62.6\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $10.3 million compared to the prior year.

Within these jurisdictions, our operations generate a mix of income and losses, which cannot be offset when calculating income tax expense or benefit for each legal entity. Income tax benefits are not recorded for losses generated in jurisdictions where either the jurisdictions do not impose an income tax, or we do not believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of such losses.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred a consolidated pre-tax loss of $17.9 million, which was composed of: (i) an aggregate of $26.0 million of pre-tax losses in jurisdictions which either do not impose an income tax or we do not believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of such losses and (ii) an aggregate of $8.1 million of pre-tax income in taxable jurisdictions. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we incurred a consolidated pre-tax loss of $22.0 million, which was composed of: (i) an aggregate of $29.3 million of pre-tax losses in jurisdictions which either do not impose an income tax or we do not believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of such losses and (ii) an aggregate of $7.3 million of pre-tax income in taxable jurisdictions.\nIncome tax (benefit) expense for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $2.2 million and $(1.3) million, respectively. Income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were composed of a current tax of $3.2 million and $2.0 million, respectively, and deferred tax (benefit) expense of $(1.0) million and $(3.3) million, respectively. The increase in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period\nin 2018 was primarily the result of the recognition $3.4 million tax benefit recorded in the prior year for the full release of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in one of our foreign jurisdictions, a gain recorded on the sale of assets in Curacao and an increase in current expense related to withholding taxes. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in income tax expense for our other jurisdictions due to lower taxable income in certain tax paying jurisdictions.\nCash paid for income taxes was $2.3 million and $1.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, our principal sources of liquidity on a consolidated basis were cash and cash equivalents of $103.3 million and $56.6 million, respectively (excluding restricted cash), which were held for working capital, investment and general corporate purposes. In addition, as of both December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had an aggregate of $4.2 million of restricted cash related to debt service reserve funds and minimum balance requirements for one of our borrowings. See Note 2- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Restricted Cash\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our working capital as of December 31, 2019 was $115.2 million compared to $64.6 million as of December 31, 2018.\nIn July 2019, we completed an underwritten sale of 4.7 million ordinary shares at a public offering price of $16.88 per share. We received net proceeds of $75.4 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.\nOur cash and cash equivalents are held by our holding company and our subsidiaries primarily in demand deposits with domestic and international banks, money market accounts, and U.S. Treasury bills. We utilize a combination of equity financing and corporate and project debt financing through international commercial banks and other financial institutions to fund our cash needs and the growth of our business. Our debt financing arrangements contain financial covenants and provisions which govern distributions by the borrowers may limit our ability to transfer cash among us and our subsidiaries. See Note 10- Long-Term Debt-Restricted Net Assets\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a summary of limitations applicable to us and our subsidiaries as of December 31, 2019. Based on our current level of operations, we believe our cash flow from operations and available cash will be adequate to meet the future liquidity needs of our current operations for at least the next twelve months.\nOur expected future liquidity and capital requirements consist principally of:\nTable 170: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncapital expenditures and investments in infrastructure under concession arrangements related to maintaining or expanding our existing operations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 171: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ndevelopment of new projects and new markets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 172: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ninventory;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 173: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nacquisitions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 174: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncosts and expenses relating to our ongoing business operations; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 175: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ndebt service requirements on our existing and future debt.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur ability to meet our debt service obligations and other capital requirements, including capital expenditures, as well as future acquisitions, will depend on our future operating performance which, in turn, will be subject to general economic, financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other conditions, many of which are beyond our control.\nWe may in the future be required to seek additional equity or debt financing to meet these future capital and liquidity requirements. If additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired or needed, our business, operating results, cash flow and financial condition would be adversely affected. We currently intend to use our available funds and any future cash flow from operations for the conduct and expansion of our business, debt service requirements and general corporate purposes.\nSubsidiary Distribution Policy\nA significant portion of our cash flow is provided by operations from our principal operating subsidiaries and borrowings made at the corporate level.\nWith respect to our Seven Seas Water segment, unless cash balances are expected to be redeployed for further growth opportunities in the same jurisdiction, our distribution policy is to efficiently distribute cash from our international operating subsidiaries to our non-U.S. intermediate holding companies for redeployment in the manner intended to optimize our return on invested capital. However, one of our subsidiaries, as of December 31, 2019, has a loan agreement that restricts distributions to related parties in the event certain financial or nonfinancial covenants are not met, which could reduce our ability to redeploy cash. Distributions are typically in the form of principal and interest payments on intercompany loans, repayment of intercompany advances or other intercompany arrangements, including billings from our Tampa operations center, and dividends. When considering the amount and timing of such distributions, our Seven Seas Water operating subsidiaries must maintain sufficient funds for future capital investment, debt service and general working capital purposes.\nWith respect to our Quench operating segment, our current intent is for Quench to retain cash for working capital, investment for future growth within the segment and for future debt repayment.\nAlthough the governing boards of our subsidiaries have discretion over intercompany dividends or other future distributions, the form, frequency and amount of such distributions will depend on our subsidiaries' future operations and earnings, capital requirements and surplus, general financial condition, contractual requirements of our lenders, tax considerations and other factors that may be deemed relevant.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the following periods:\nTable 176: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n31,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n26,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(52,468)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(214,540)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n68,180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n126,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEffect of exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(25)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n46,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(61,588)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nThe significant variations of cash provided by operating activities and net losses are principally related to adjustments to eliminate non-cash and non-operating charges including, but not limited to, amortization, depreciation, share-based compensation, changes in the deferred income tax provision, charges related to the disposal of assets and impairment charges. The largest source of operating cash flow is the collection of trade receivables and our largest use of cash flows is the payment of costs associated with revenue and SG&A expenses.\nCash provided by operations during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $31.0 million and $26.9 million, respectively. The increase in cash flow from operations was primarily due to overall higher operating cash inflows driven by the large acquisitions in late 2018 which was partially offset by higher cash interest expense related to incremental borrowings of $150 million in connection with the expansions of our senior secured credit agreement in November and December 2018.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $52.5 million and $214.6 million, respectively. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to a decrease of $178.8 million of net cash paid for acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the prior year period. This was partially offset by an increase of $17.0 million in capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the prior year period.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash paid for acquisitions was $19.7 million as compared to $198.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 there were $21.0 million and $3.5 million, respectively, of capital expenditures by Seven Seas Water primarily for new plants, plant expansions and capacity upgrades and $15.6 million and $16.1 million, respectively, of capital expenditures for Quench primarily to support existing operations.\nCapital Expenditures on Fixed Assets and Investments in Long-Lived Assets\nFor Seven Seas Water, our primary capital expenditures are composed of construction costs of our plants, including engineering, procurement and construction and equipment costs, internal direct labor and project development costs, which include engineering and environmental studies, permitting and licensing and certain legal costs. Major repairs and maintenance, which improve the efficiency or extend the life of our operating plants, are also included in capital expenditures. In addition to our contractually committed capital expenditures, we routinely explore project investment opportunities in our current and new geographic locations and business lines if we believe that any of the opportunities has the potential to meet our internal investment criteria. In the course of pursuing these investment opportunities, we may successfully bid on projects or operating plants that will require additional capital expenditures. For Quench, our primary capital expenditures are the acquisition of POU systems and related assets as well as typical capital expenditures for leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, computers, field tablets and software.\nFor the fiscal year 2020, we expect to invest approximately $27 million across our Seven Seas Water and Quench segments in capital expenditures, primarily to support growth opportunities. We expect that these investments will be financed through existing cash and cash generated from operations.\nSignificant 2019 Acquisitions\nOn June 1, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Aguaman for an aggregate purchase price of $1.5 million. On July 15, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Carolina Pure for an aggregate purchase price of $7.3 million. On October 1, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Mirex for an aggregate purchase price of $11.6 million.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $68.2 million and $126.1 million, respectively. The $57.8 million net decrease in cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to a decrease of $150.0 million of net proceeds from long-term debt related to incremental borrowings in connection with the expansions of our senior secured credit agreement in November and December 2018. This decrease was partially offset by net proceeds of $75.4 million received in connection with issuance of 4.7 million ordinary shares at a public offering price of $16.88 per share in July 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, long-term debt included the following (in thousands):\nTable 177: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCorporate Credit Agreement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBVI Loan Agreement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14,838\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n20,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nVehicle financing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal face value of long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n318,174\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n322,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFace value of long-term debt, current\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,520\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n6,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLess: Current portion of unamortized debt discounts and deferred financing fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(29)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(42)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCurrent portion of long-term debt, net of debt discounts and deferred financing fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n6,494\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFace value of long-term debt, non-current\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n310,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n315,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLess: Non-current portion of unamortized debt discounts and deferred financing fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,550)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2,559)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLong-term debt, net of debt discounts and deferred financing fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n309,104\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n313,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCorporate Credit Agreement\nOn August 4, 2017, AquaVenture Holdings Limited, AquaVenture Holdings Peru S.A.C., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and Quench USA, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, (collectively the Borrowers\u201d) entered into a $150.0 million senior secured credit agreement (the Corporate Credit Agreement\u201d) with a syndicate of lenders. The Corporate Credit Agreement is non-amortizing, matures in August 2021, at the time it was incurred, bore interest at LIBOR plus 6.0% with a LIBOR floor of 1.0%. Interest only payments are due quarterly with principal due in full upon maturity.\nOn November 17, 2017, the Corporate Credit Agreement was amended to convert the interest rate applicable to 50% of the then-outstanding principal balance, or $75.0 million, from a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus 6.0% with a LIBOR floor of 1.0% to a fixed rate of 8.2%. The remaining 50% of the then-outstanding principal balance, of $75.0 million, continued to bear interest at LIBOR plus 6.0% with a LIBOR floor of 1.0%. All other material terms of the original credit agreement remained substantially unchanged.\nOn August 28, 2018, the Corporate Credit Agreement was amended to modify certain agreement definitions and non-financial covenants. All other material terms of the original credit agreement remained substantially unchanged.\nOn November 1, 2018, the Corporate Credit Agreement was amended ( Amended Corporate Credit Agreement\u201d) to: (i) add AquaVenture Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, as a borrower under the Amended Corporate Credit Agreement, (ii) increase our net borrowings by $110.0 million to an aggregate principal amount of $260.0 million, (iii) reduce the interest rate for the original $150.0 million borrowings by 50 basis points on both the variable and fixed interest portions and (iv) amend certain financial covenant requirements. Of the incremental net borrowing of $110.0 million, $70.0 million bears interest at a variable rate of LIBOR plus 5.5% with a LIBOR floor of 1.0%, and the remaining $40.0 million bears interest at a fixed rate of 8.7%. In the aggregate, including the aforementioned interest rate reduction, $145.0 million of borrowings bear interest at a variable rate of LIBOR plus 5.5% with a LIBOR floor of 1.0% and the remaining $115.0 million of borrowings bear interest at a weighted average fixed rate of 8.0%. A declining prepayment fee on the incremental borrowing was due upon repayment if it occurred prior to November 1, 2019. All other material terms of the Amended Corporate Credit Agreement remained substantially unchanged.\nOn December 20, 2018, the Corporate Credit Agreement was amended to increase its borrowings by $40.0 million to an aggregate principal amount of $300.0 million. The incremental borrowings bear interest at a variable rate of LIBOR plus 5.5% with a LIBOR floor of 1.0%. A prepayment fee on the incremental borrowing, which declines over time, was due upon repayment if it occurred prior to December 20, 2019. These additional borrowings are non-amortizing and mature in August 2021. All other terms of the Corporate Credit Agreement remained substantially unchanged.\nOn December 10, 2019, the Corporate Credit Agreement was amended to modify certain covenants. All other material terms of the original credit agreement remained substantially unchanged.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the weighted average interest rate was 7.7%.\nThe Corporate Credit Agreement is guaranteed by AquaVenture Holdings Limited along with certain subsidiaries and contains financial and nonfinancial covenants. The financial covenants include minimum interest coverage ratio and maximum leverage ratio requirements, as defined in the Corporate Credit Agreement, and are calculated using consolidated financial information of AquaVenture Holdings Limited excluding the results of AquaVenture (BVI) Holdings Limited and its subsidiary Seven Seas Water (BVI) Limited. In addition, the Corporate Credit Agreement contains customary negative covenants limiting, among other things, indebtedness, investments, liens, dispositions of assets, restricted payments (including dividends), transactions with affiliates, prepayments of indebtedness, capital expenditures, changes in nature of business and amendments to documents. As of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with, or received waivers for breaches of, all such covenants.\nWe may prepay in whole or in part, the outstanding principal and accrued unpaid interest under the Corporate Credit Agreement. The prepayment fee requirement has expired on the original $150.0 million borrowing. The Corporate Credit Agreement is collateralized by certain of the assets of the Borrowers and stated guarantors.\nBVI Loan Agreement\nIn connection with our acquisition of the capital stock of Biwater (BVI) Holdings Limited in June 2015, we inherited the $43.0 million credit facility of its subsidiary, Seven Seas Water (BVI) Ltd., arranged by a bank (the BVI Loan Agreement\u201d). The BVI Loan Agreement closed on November 14, 2013 and was arranged to finance the construction of the 2.8 million GPD desalination facility at Paraquita Bay in Tortola, BVI and other contractual obligations. The BVI Loan Agreement is project financing with recourse only to the stock, assets and cash flow of Seven Seas Water (BVI) Ltd. The BVI Loan Agreement is guaranteed by the United Kingdom Export Finance. As of the acquisition date of June 11, 2015, $40.8 million remained outstanding. In addition, approximately $820 thousand remained available for draw through October 2016. The BVI Loan Agreement was amended on May 7, 2014 and June 11, 2015 to reflect extensions in milestone dates and our acquisition of Seven Seas Water (BVI) Ltd. The BVI Loan Agreement is collateralized by all shares and underlying assets of Seven Seas Water (BVI) Ltd.\nPrior to the amendment on August 4, 2017, the BVI Loan Agreement provided for interest on the outstanding borrowings at LIBOR plus 3.5% per annum and interest was paid quarterly. The loan principal is repayable quarterly beginning in March 31, 2015 in 26 quarterly installments that escalate over the term of the loan.\nOn August 4, 2017, Seven Seas Water (BVI) Ltd. further amended the BVI Loan Agreement to extend the amortization on principal to May 2022 and reduce the spread applied to the LIBOR base rate used in the calculation of interest by 50 basis points to LIBOR plus 3.0% per annum. The United Kingdom Export Finance also extended its participation in the project to match the extended term of the amended BVI Loan Agreement. All other material terms of the original loan agreement remained unchanged.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the weighted-average interest rate was 5.1%. Seven Seas Water (BVI) Ltd. may prepay the principal amounts of the loans prior to the maturity date, in whole or in part.\nThe BVI Loan Agreement includes both financial and nonfinancial covenants, limits the amount of additional indebtedness that Seven Seas Water (BVI) Ltd. can incur and places annual limits on capital expenditures for this subsidiary. The BVI Loan Agreement also places restrictions on distributions made by Seven Seas Water (BVI) Ltd. which is only permitted to make distributions to shareholders and affiliates of AquaVenture Holdings Limited if specified debt service coverage and loan life coverage ratios are met and it is in compliance with all loan covenants. The BVI Loan Agreement contains a number of negative covenants restricting, among other things, indebtedness, investments, liens, dispositions of assets, restricted payments (including dividends), mergers and acquisitions, accounting changes, transactions with affiliates, prepayments of indebtedness, capital expenditures, and changes in nature of business and joint ventures. In addition, Seven Seas Water (BVI) Ltd is subject to quarterly financial covenant compliance, including minimum debt service and loan life coverage ratios, and must maintain a minimum debt service reserve fund and a maintenance reserve fund with the bank in addition to other minimum balance requirements as set forth in the agreement. As of December 31, 2019, Seven Seas Water (BVI) Ltd. was in compliance with, or received waivers for breaches of, all such covenants.\nOther Debt\nWe finance our vehicles primarily under three-year terms with interest rates per annum ranging from 3.0% to 4.5%.\nContractual Obligations and Other Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and other commitments as of December 31, 2019:\nTable 178: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPayments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLess Than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1 to 3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3 to 5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMore Than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nContractual Obligations and Other Commitments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLong-term debt at face value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,520\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n310,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n318,174\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest on long-term debt (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n23,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n58,174\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n81,975\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating leases(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,615\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,575\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n16,102\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAsset retirement obligations (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAcquisition contingent consideration (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,370\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n37,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n374,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n5,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n420,168\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 179: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nWe calculated interest on long-term debt based on payment terms that existed at December 31, 2019.

The remaining $0.6 million and $0.7 million of the Company's unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, are fully indemnified pursuant to purchase agreements for business combinations and, if realized, would impact the effective tax rate. In addition, the amount of accumulated penalties and interest related to the unrecognized tax benefit was $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded, in the aggregate, an accrued liability of $0.9 million and $1.0 million, respectively, and a corresponding indemnification receivable of $0.9 million and $1.0 million, respectively, related to the uncertain tax benefits and contractual indemnifications.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the section titled Selected Consolidated Financial Data\u201d and financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that\ncould cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nAquaVenture Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries (the Company\u201d, AquaVenture\u201d, we\u201d, us\u201d and our\u201d) is a multinational provider of Water-as-a-Service\u00ae, or WAAS\u00ae, solutions that provide our customers with a reliable and cost-effective source of clean drinking water, processed water and wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions primarily under long-term contracts that minimize capital investment by the customer. We believe our WAAS business model offers a differentiated value proposition that generates long-term customer relationships, recurring revenue, predictable cash flow and attractive rates of return. We generate revenue from our operations in North America, the Caribbean and South America and are pursuing expansion opportunities in North America, the Caribbean, South America, Africa, the Middle East and other select markets.\nWe deliver our WAAS solutions through two operating platforms: Seven Seas Water and Quench. Seven Seas Water is a multinational provider of desalination, wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions to governmental, municipal (including utility districts), industrial, property developer and hospitality customers. Our desalination solutions provide more than 8.5 billion gallons per year of potable, high purity industrial grade and ultra-pure water (which is water that is treated to meet higher purity standards required for industrial, semiconductor, utility or pharmaceutical applications). Our wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions, which include plants ranging in capacity from 5,000 gallons per day, or GPD, to more than 1.5 million GPD, are provided through 105 leases with customers as well as through the sale of equipment. Quench, is a U.S.-based provider of Point-of-Use, or POU, filtered water systems and related services through direct and indirect sales channels to approximately 60,000 institutional and commercial customers, including more than half of the Fortune 500, throughout the United States and Canada.\nOur Seven Seas Water platform generates recurring revenue through long-term contracts for our desalination and wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the significant majority of our Seven Seas Water revenue is derived from our desalination solutions in six different locations:\n \u00b7 The USVI: Seven Seas Water provides all of the municipal potable water needs for the islands of St. Croix, St. Thomas and St. John through its two seawater desalination plants, one on St. Croix and one on St. Thomas, having a combined capacity of approximately 7.0 million GPD.

Upon completion of an expansion during July 2016, total capacity was increased to 6.7 million GPD. \n \u00b7 The BVI: Seven Seas Water is the primary supplier of Tortola's potable water needs through its seawater desalination plant having a capacity of approximately 2.8 million GPD, which we began operating after we acquired the capital stock of Biwater (BVI) Holdings Limited on June 11, 2015. \n \u00b7 Peru: Seven Seas Water provides seawater and desalinated process water to a phosphate mine through a pipeline and seawater reverse osmosis facility having a capacity of approximately 2.7 million GPD, which we began operating after we completed the acquisition of all the outstanding shares of Aguas de Bayovar S.A.C. ( ADB\u201d) and all the rights and obligations under a design and construction contract for a desalination plant and related infrastructure located in Peru (the Peru Acquisition\u201d) on October 31, 2016. \nOn June 28, 2019, we received formal notice from Cura\u00e7ao Refinery Utilities B.V. ( CRU\u201d) that it is exercising its right to purchase our desalination facilities pursuant to the terms of the existing water supply agreement. The existing water supply agreement with CRU began in December 2008, with the Company providing water from a desalination plant with an initial design capacity of 0.5 million gallons per day under a five-year contract. This agreement has been amended several times, resulting in both expanded water production to the current design capacity of 4.9 million GPD and an extended contract expiration date of December 31, 2019. Pursuant to the terms of the water supply agreement, the applicable buy-out amount, upon consummation of the buyout right by CRU, was $3.5 million due upon the contract expiration date of December 31, 2019. On December 31, 2019, CRU consummated the execution of its buy-out right, and the Company received a cash payment of $3.5 million.\nThrough our Seven Seas Water wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions, we design, fabricate and install plants that are leased under a contractual term or sold to customers. The wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions offered to customers include scalable modular treatment plants, field-erected plants and temporary bypass plants ranging from 5,000 GPD to more than 1.5 million GPD. These solutions are provided through 105 leases with customers. With the November 1, 2018 AUC Acquisition, in which we acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of AUC pursuant to a membership interest purchase agreement, we significantly increased our wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions, which has contributed significantly to our Seven Seas Water revenues.\nWe are supported by operations centers in Tampa, Florida and Houston, Texas, which provides business development, engineering, field service support, procurement, accounting, finance and other administrative functions.\nOur Quench platform generates recurring revenue from the rental and servicing of POU water filtration systems and related equipment, such as ice and sparkling water machines, and from the contracted maintenance of customer owned equipment. Quench also generates revenue from the sale of coffee and consumables under agreements requiring customers to purchase a minimum amount monthly in exchange for the use of a coffee brewer. Our annual unit attrition rate at December 31, 2019 was less than 7.5%, implying an average rental period of more than 12 years. Through our direct sales channel, we receive recurring fees for the units we rent or service throughout the life of our customer relationship. In addition, we also receive non-recurring revenue from some customers for the sale of equipment and for certain services, such as the installation, relocation or removal of equipment. Through our indirect sales channel, we receive re-occurring revenue from the sale of equipment, parts and filters to dealers and retailers. We achieve an attractive return on our rental assets due to strong customer retention. We provide our systems and services to a broad mix of industries, including government, education, medical, manufacturing, retail, and hospitality, among others. We operate principally throughout the United States and Canada and are supported by a primary operations center in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania.\nFor the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, our consolidated revenue was $203.5 million and $145.6 million, respectively. The $57.9 million increase from 2018 to 2019 was primarily due to inclusion of incremental revenues from our acquisitions during 2018 and 2019 in addition to organic growth of existing operations. Including both organic and inorganic growth, our CAGR for revenue was 24.8% from 2014 to 2019.\nAgreement and Plan of Merger\nOn December 23, 2019, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or Merger Agreement, with Culligan International Company, or Culligan, a Delaware corporation, and Amberjack Merger Sub Limited, or Merger Sub, a business incorporated under the laws of the British Virgin Islands and wholly-owned subsidiary of Culligan. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions therein, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the Merger\u201d). As a result of the Merger, the Company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Culligan. The closing of the Merger remains subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the remaining conditions to the Merger set forth in the Merger Agreement. We expect the Merger to close no later than the end of the second quarter of 2020.\n2019 Acquisition Activities\nOn June 1, 2019, we acquired substantially all of the water filtration assets and assumed certain liabilities of Aguaman, Inc.

( Pure Planet\u201d), a POU water filtration company based in Palm Desert, California, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement. The estimated aggregate purchase price, subject to adjustments, was $0.2 million, which included approximately $0.1 million of cash and $0.1 million payable on the one-year anniversary of the transaction. The assets acquired consist primarily of in-place lease agreements and the related POU systems in the United States.\nOn December 16, 2019, we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Jonli Water Services, Inc. ( Jonli\u201d), a POU water filtration company based in Quebec, Canada pursuant to an asset purchase agreement. The estimated aggregate purchase price, subject to adjustments, was $0.4 million, which was paid in cash. The assets acquired consist primarily of in-place maintenance agreements in Canada.\nWhile we routinely identify and evaluate potential acquisition candidates and engage in discussions and negotiations regarding potential acquisitions, there can be no assurance that any of our discussions or negotiations will result in an acquisition. If we enter into definitive agreements, there can be no assurances that all the conditions precedent to completing those acquisitions will be satisfied or waived, or that the acquisitions will be completed. Further, if we make any acquisitions, there can be no assurance that we will be able to operate or integrate any acquired businesses profitably or otherwise successfully implement our expansion strategy.\nOperating Segments\nWe have two reportable segments that align with our operating platforms, Seven Seas Water and Quench. The segment determination is supported by, among other factors, the existence of individuals responsible for the operations of each segment and who also report directly to our chief operating decision maker ( CODM\u201d), the nature of the segment's operations and information presented to our CODM. For the year ended December 31, 2019, revenues for the Seven Seas Water and Quench segments represented approximately 43% and 57%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues.\nIn addition to the Seven Seas Water and Quench segments, we record certain general and administrative costs that are not allocated to either of the reportable segments within Corporate and Other\u201d for the CODM and for segment reporting purposes. These costs include, but are not limited to, professional service fees and other expenses to support the activities of the registrant holding company. Corporate and Other does not include any labor allocations from the Seven Seas Water and Quench segments. We believe this presentation more accurately portrays the results of the core operations of each of the operating and reportable segments to the CODM. The Corporate and Other administration function is not treated as a segment.\nAs part of the segment reconciliation, intercompany interest expense and the associated intercompany interest income are included but are eliminated in consolidation.\nComponents of Revenues and Expenses\nManagement reviews the results of operations using a variety of measurements and procedures including an analysis of the statements of operations and comprehensive income which management considers an important aspect of our performance analysis. To help the reader better understand the discussion of operating results, details regarding certain line items have been provided below.\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the guidance regarding both revenue from contracts with customers and the determination of the customer in a service concession contract on a full retrospective basis (the Adopted Revenue Guidance\u201d). Several of the Company's contracts were impacted primarily due to the identification of multiple performance obligations within a single contract. However, the Adopted Revenue Guidance did not have a cash impact and, therefore, does not affect the economics of our underlying customer contracts. The adoption did, however, result in differences in the way our revenues, gross profit and net loss are determined compared to historical periods as presented within our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. More specifically, the Adopted Revenue Guidance impacted contracts with customers in our Seven Seas Water segment determined to be service concession arrangements and the classification of financing income. Contracts with customers within the Quench segment remained substantially unchanged.\nFor a discussion on our accounting policies as restated in accordance with the Adopted Revenue Guidance, please refer to Note 2- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenues\nSeven Seas Water\nOur Seven Seas Water business generates revenue from our desalination and wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions provided to governmental, municipal (including utility districts), industrial, property developer and hospitality customers. Revenues from our desalination solutions are primarily generated from contracts with customers to deliver treated bulk water, through both bulk water sales and service and service concession arrangements. Revenues from our wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions are primarily generated from capital and financed equipment sales, and leasing arrangements of up to five years.\nBulk water sales and service, which represent our desalination solutions, can include the delivery of bulk water or bulk water services, including the operations and maintenance of a customer-owned plant. We recognize revenues from the delivery of bulk water or the performance of bulk water services at the time the water or services are delivered to the customers in accordance with the contractual agreements. Certain agreements contain a minimum monthly charge provision which allows the Company to invoice the customer for the greater of the water supplied or a minimum monthly charge. The volume of water supplied is based on meter readings performed at or near the end of the month. Estimates of revenue for unbilled water are recorded when meter readings occur at a time other than the end of a period.\nCertain contracts with customers which require the construction of facilities to provide bulk water to a specific customer contain multiple obligations, including an implicit lease for the bulk water facilities and bulk water services, including operations and maintenance. The implicit lease obligation is generally accounted for as an operating lease as a result of the provisions of the contract. Revenues for contracts with both implicit lease and non-lease components are generally recognized ratably over the contract period as delivered to the customer after taking into consideration our analysis of contingent rent, any minimum take-or-pay provisions and contractual unit pricing.\nService concession arrangements are agreements entered into with a public-sector entity which controls both (i) the ability to modify or approve the services and prices provided by the operating company and (ii) beneficial entitlement to, or residual interest in, the infrastructure at the end of the term of the agreement. Service concession arrangements typically include the construction of infrastructure for the customer and an obligation to provide operations and maintenance on the infrastructure constructed.\nOur wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions generate recurring revenue from the rental of wastewater treatment and water reuse equipment. Our equipment is typically rented under multi-year term, automatically renewing contracts. We record the recurring fees received as revenue for the units we rent ratably throughout the term of each contract period.\nRevenues related to the construction of infrastructure, or product sales revenue, for both our desalination and wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions are recognized over time, using the input method based on cost incurred, which typically begins at the later of commencement of the construction or transfer of control, with revenue being fully recognized upon the completion of the infrastructure as control of the infrastructure is transferred to the customer. Timing differences between when the construction performance obligations are completed and when cash is received from the customer could result in a significant financing component. If a significant financing component is identified, the Company will recognize interest income, or financing revenues, on a long-term receivable established upon the completion of the construction of the infrastructure. Future cash flows received from the customer related to the long-term receivable are bifurcated between the principal repayment of the long-term receivable and the related financing revenue. Revenues related to the operations and maintenance are recognized as revenues as the services are provided to the customer.\nQuench\nOur Quench direct sales channel generates recurring revenue from the rental and servicing of POU water filtration systems and related equipment, such as ice and sparkling water machines, and from the contracted maintenance of customer-owned equipment. In addition, we also receive non-recurring revenue from some customers from the sale of equipment and for certain services, such as the installation, relocation or removal of equipment. Quench also generates revenue from the sale of coffee and consumables. Through our indirect sales channel, we receive re-occurring revenue from the sale of equipment, parts and filters to dealers and retailers.\nThe majority of Quench's direct sales channel customers rent our systems under multi-year, automatically renewing contracts. We record the recurring fees received as revenue for the units we rent ratably throughout the term of each contract period. Non-recurring revenues are recorded at the time services are performed or upon the customer taking control of the equipment and/or products sold.\nCost of Revenues\nSeven Seas Water\nCost of revenues for our Seven Seas Water business consists primarily of the cost of equipment depreciation; cost of equipment constructed for sale; and costs for operating and maintaining equipment on behalf of the customer. Expenditures in connection with the installation of our leased equipment are capitalized as contract fulfillment costs and depreciated to cost of revenues over the estimated useful life of the contract.\nEquipment depreciation is the largest component of our cost of revenues. In the future, we expect that our depreciation and cost of revenue will increase with the addition of new equipment and future acquisitions. Equipment depreciation is calculated using a straight-line method with an allowance for estimated residual values. Depreciation rates are determined based on the estimated useful lives of the assets. Depreciation commences when the equipment is placed into service.\nEquipment construction related to product sales revenue can include the cost of equipment and related installation services, including construction labor costs, field engineering costs, and third-party services. Such expenses can vary depending on the size of the desalination or wastewater plant or the complexity of the application, number of projects and the prevailing labor market for the level of employees needed in the jurisdiction where the plant is being constructed.\nOperating costs for operating and maintaining the equipment on behalf of the customer, which is primarily related to our desalination solutions, includes personnel costs (including compensation and other related personnel costs for employees), electric power, repairs and maintenance, personnel and travel costs for field engineering services and the cost of consumables. Labor costs are generally consistent within a normal range of plant production but can vary from\nplant to plant depending on the size of the plant and the complexity of the water application. Costs of labor can vary depending on the prevailing labor market for the level of employees needed in the jurisdiction where the plant is located.\nElectrical power for our large plants is generally provided by the customer or charged by us to the customer as a pass-through cost; however, our contracts normally require us to maintain electrical usage at or below a specified level of kilowatt hours for each gallon of water produced.\nExpenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred whereas betterments for property, plant and equipment owned by us that add capacity, significantly improve operating efficiency or extend the asset life are capitalized.\nField engineering services include mainly the cost of labor and travel for our specially trained and skilled employees who handle more complex maintenance tasks and to troubleshoot performance issues with our plant equipment and systems. Such expenses can vary depending on the number of projects and the time and extent of the maintenance requirements.\nConsumables are typically chemical additives used in the pre- and post-production processes to meet the water quality and attribute specifications of our customers.\nQuench\nCost of revenues for our Quench business consists primarily of the cost of personnel and travel for our field service, supply chain and technician scheduling and dispatch teams; depreciation of rental equipment and field service vehicles; the cost of equipment purchased or manufactured for resale; the cost of coffee and related consumables; the cost of filters and repair parts; and freight costs. Expenditures incurred in connection with the installation of our rental equipment are capitalized and depreciated to cost of revenues over their estimated useful life.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nEach segment reports the selling, general and administrative expenses that pertain to its business. General and administrative costs that are not allocated to either of the reportable segments are reported in Corporate and Other\u201d for the CODM and for segment reporting purposes. These costs include, but are not limited to, professional service fees and other expenses to support the activities of the registrant holding company. Corporate and Other does not include any labor allocations from the Seven Seas Water and Quench segments. We believe this presentation more accurately portrays the results of the core operations of each of the operating and reportable segments to the CODM. The Corporate and Other administration function is not treated as a segment.\nSeven Seas Water\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for Seven Seas Water consist primarily of compensation and benefits (including salaries, benefits and share-based compensation), third-party professional service fees and travel. Such expenses include personnel and travel costs of our business development organization, third party and internal engineering costs incurred in connection with new project feasibility studies or proposals, and costs for operating business development offices and activities. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include personnel and related costs for our executive, engineering, procurement, finance and human resources organizations and other administrative employees; third party professional service fees for consulting, legal, accounting and tax services; depreciation of office equipment and improvements and computer systems and software not directly related to specific revenue generating projects; amortization expense associated with intangible assets acquired in connection with business combinations, which are amortized over their expected useful lives; and other corporate expenses. In the future, we expect that our selling, general and administrative expenses will increase due to business development efforts in new markets and the general infrastructure to support our future growth.\nQuench\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for Quench include costs related to our selling and marketing functions as well as general and administrative costs associated with our operations center and operating locations, including information systems, finance, customer care, and human resources. Such costs include personnel costs\n(including salaries, benefits and share-based compensation), non-capitalized commissions, amortization of deferred lease costs, expenses related to lead generation, amortization expense associated with intangible assets acquired in connection with business combinations, which are amortized over their expected useful lives, fees for third-party professional services (including consulting, legal, accounting and tax services), travel, depreciation of non-service equipment and other administrative expenses.\nOther Expense and Income\nOther expense and income consists mainly of interest expense and interest income. Interest expense primarily relates to bank and private lender debt. In the future, we expect that our interest expense will increase as a result of the use of debt financing to support our organic and inorganic growth. Interest income primarily relates to interest received on certain cash and cash equivalent investments of three months or less.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Performance and Comparability of Results\nA number of key factors have affected and will continue to affect our performance and the comparison of our operating results, including matters discussed below and those items described in the section entitled Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSeven Seas Water\nThe financial performance of our Seven Seas Water business has been, and will continue to be, significantly affected by our ability to identify and consummate acquisitions of, or to identify and secure new projects for, desalination, wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions with new and existing governmental, municipal, industrial, property developer and hospitality customers. Our performance and the comparability of results over time are largely driven by the timing of events such as acquisitions of existing plants, securing new plant projects (including bulk water sales and service), rental agreements and product sales, plant expansions, and the extension, termination or expiration of water supply agreements and rental agreements for wastewater treatment and water reuse equipment. The timing of many of these events is unpredictable. New plant projects, plant expansions and plant acquisitions, when they do occur, may require significant levels of cash and company resources before and after the commencement of revenue and their impact on our results of operations can be significant.\nThe table below summarizes significant events in 2019 and 2018 that affect the performance and comparability of financial results for these and future periods:\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCapacity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCommencement\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPlant Name\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLocation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEvent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nGPD)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPoint Blanche\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSt. Maarten\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nContract amendment (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nN/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nApril 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAnguilla\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAnguilla\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPlant acquisition\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOctober 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAnguilla\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAnguilla\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPlant expansion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMarch 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLimetree Bay Terminal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSt. Croix\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNew contract with expansion (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNovember 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCRU Refinery\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCura\u00e7ao\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nContract expiration (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nN/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Effective April 1, 2018, we entered into an amendment to the water purchase agreement in St. Maarten. The amendment reduced the required minimum monthly water purchase by our customer, in exchange for a four-year extension to the water contract. The reduction in the required minimum monthly water purchase will remain in effect for three years, after which time the average monthly minimum purchase will then revert to previous minimum requirements for the remainder of the contract. Our customer has the option to extend the lower minimum volumes for an additional two years, which, if exercised, would also extend the contract expiry from 2025 to 2027. \n (2) Effective November 1, 2019, we terminated our original agreement in St. Croix and subsequently entered new agreement with the customer. Under the new agreement, which expires in 2024, we expanded the design capacity of the plant by 1.0 million GPD. \n (3) On December 31, 2019, our water supply agreement in Cura\u00e7ao expired and our customer, CRU, exercised its right to purchase the desalination facilities pursuant to the terms of the existing water supply agreement. The applicable buy-out amount, upon consummation of the buyout right, is $3.5 million due upon the contract expiration date. On December 31, 2019, CRU consummated the execution of its buy-out right and the Company received a cash payment of $3.5 million. This payment was recorded as a gain on sale of property, plant and equipment, which is reflected within SG&A in our Seven Seas Water segment. \nIn addition to the table above, we also acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of AUC on November 1, 2018. The acquired wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions, which include plants ranging in capacity from 5,000 GPD to more than 1.5 million GPD, are provided through 105 leases with customers.\nTime and Expense Associated with New Business Development\nThe period of time required to develop an opportunity and secure an award can be lengthy, historically taking multiple years during which significant amounts of business development expense may be incurred. Our business development organization seeks to identify new project opportunities for both competitive bid situations and through unsolicited negotiated arrangements. Governmental water customers generally require a competitive bid for new plant development. Participation in a formal bid process and in negotiated arrangements can require significant costs, the timing of which can impact the comparability of our financial results. While our proposed pricing factors in such costs, there is no assurance that we will secure the contract and ultimately recover our costs.\nThe period from contract award to the commissioning of a new plant (and commencement of revenues) can also vary greatly due to, among other things, the size and complexity of the plant. In the case of a newly constructed desalination plant, there is typically a ramp-up period during which the plant operates below normal capacity.\nExisting Customer Relationships\nWe expect to continue to grow our business with existing customers by expanding and extending the contractual term for existing plants to meet an expected increase in customer demand, each of which will impact our performance and comparability of results. As customer demand increases for either the volume of water produced and delivered or the wastewater treated, we typically experience increased sales volume through the use of additional capacity built into existing desalination plants or through the renegotiation of an existing contract and deployment of\nincremental equipment to meet customer demands. Similarly, contract extensions and renewals provide economic benefits for both the customer and us. By the time we enter into an extension or renewal we have typically recovered meaningful portions of our capital investment and only incremental capital investment may be required. These factors provide a competitive advantage in a contract extension (or renewal) process and may enable us to reduce unit prices, sustain profitability and achieve an improved and continuing return on our invested capital.\nAcquisition of Existing Assets or Business\nRevenue and expenses will increase upon an acquisition of existing assets or businesses from a third party. In addition, the time, cost and capital required to complete an acquisition are significant. Specifically, the costs incurred prior to the acquisition can include professional fees, travel costs and, in certain instances, success fees paid to third parties. These costs may be incurred well in advance of the completion of an acquisition. Upon completion of the acquisition, certain assets, including desalination plants, may experience periods of downtime or reduced production levels as well as additional capital investment while we bring the plant up to our engineering and operating standards. Acquisitions are a part of our Seven Seas Water growth strategy and accordingly our ability to grow could be impacted by our effectiveness in completing and integrating our acquisitions.\nEntry into New Markets\nOur future performance will be affected by our investment and success in securing business in new markets. While continuing to penetrate the Caribbean market, we have also expanded our business development efforts to pursue a global business footprint in North America, South America, Africa, the Middle East and other select markets. As we continue to pursue entry into new markets, we may incur increasing expenses for business development that may be sustained for long periods of time before realizing the benefit of incremental revenues. In addition, our entry into some new markets may be better served through partnering arrangements such as joint ventures, which may result in a minority position. Such an arrangement may be economically attractive even though, in some circumstances, we may not be able to consolidate the operating results of a partnering arrangement with our own operating results.\nChanges to Sales Volume, Costs of Sales and Operating Expenses\nFor our desalination solutions, our profitability is affected by changes in the volume of water delivered above any minimum required customer purchases, our ability to control plant production costs, and our ability to control equipment manufacturing costs and operating expenses. For our wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions, our profitability is affected by the number and profitability of construction projects commenced and completed during the period and the number of new leases entered into with customers.\nDue to the capital-intensive nature of our desalination solutions and the relatively high level of fixed costs such as depreciation and contract cost amortization, our Seven Seas Water business model is characterized by high levels of operating leverage. As a result, significant swings in bulk water production volume could favorably or unfavorably impact profitability more significantly than business models with less operating leverage. We have mitigated the downside risk of declines in bulk water plant production through the inclusion of minimum customer purchase requirements in a majority of our eight water supply contracts with our major customers. In the other two water supply contracts, we have contractual rights to be the exclusive water supplier or our customer must purchase all the water we produce and we must provide volume at a specified percentage of installed capacity. We design our plants to meet or exceed contractual supply requirements but our failure to meet minimum supply requirements could result in penalties that may adversely affect our financial performance.\nOperating costs for our desalination solutions can have a significant impact on the profitability of our operations. Electrical costs are a major expense in connection with the operation of a water treatment plant. Our major customers either, directly or through related parties, provide the electricity needed to run the plant without cost to us or reimburse us for this cost on a pass-through basis. In general, our contracts require us to maintain electrical usage at or below a specified level of kilowatt hours for each gallon of water produced. As a result, our cost risk is principally with respect to our ability to use electrical power efficiently. We have made investments in plant equipment and configuration to maintain required levels of electrical efficiency.\nPersonnel costs are another major cost element for plant operations. Our contracts provide for price adjustments based on inflation. Profitability, however, could be adversely affected by significant increases in market prices for labor, social taxes and benefits or changes in operations requiring additional personnel.\nRepairs and maintenance can be a significant cost of the business. Because we assume the responsibility to operate and maintain our desalination plants over a long period of time, we use plant designs and equipment that seek to minimize repairs and maintenance and optimize long-term performance. We may however, from time to time experience equipment failures outside of warranty coverage which could result in significant costs to repair.\nOur operations centers in Tampa, Florida and Houston, Texas incur significant selling, general and administrative expenses that are intended to support our plans for future growth. Certain of these expenses, in particular those related to business development, are largely discretionary and not correlated specifically to short-term changes in revenue. Direct engineering cost, including allocated overhead, for personnel at our operations centers are capitalized as a project cost based on hours incurred on active plant construction projects which can change from period to period. The timing of new hires, the utilization of engineering personnel and the spending in these areas may affect the comparability of our results.\nContractually Scheduled and Negotiated Changes to Terms and Conditions\nOur Seven Seas Water business is conducted in accordance with the terms of long-term water supply contracts that, among other things, may provide for minimum customer purchases, guaranteed supply volumes and specified levels of pricing based on the volume of water purchased during the billing period. These contractual features are key determinants of plant revenue and plant profitability. Certain of our contracts provide for contractually scheduled price changes. In addition, our contracts may include provisions to increase prices in accordance with a specified inflation index such as the consumer price index. From time to time, we may also negotiate pricing changes with our customers as part of an arrangement to, among other things, extend or renew a contract or increase capacity by expanding the plant.\nRevenues and operating income can be expected to decrease, potentially by a significant amount, upon a decrease in contracted services or contract renegotiation, termination or expiration.\nCustomer Demand and Certain Other External Factors\nFor our desalination solutions, we design plant capacity to exceed the minimum purchase requirements contained in our contracts to meet anticipated customer needs and maintain sufficient excess capacity. Our customer's water demand and our ability to meet that demand can vary among quarters and annual periods for a variety of reasons over which we have little control, including:\n \u00b7 the timing and length of shutdowns of customer facilities or infrastructure due to factors such as equipment failures, power outages, regular scheduled maintenance and severe weather which can adversely affect customer demand; \n \u00b7 seasonal fluctuations or downturns in the general economy can be expected to adversely affect demand from customers for whom tourism is a significant economic driver, including our municipal or resort customers; \n \u00b7 economic cycles may affect the industrial customers we serve, especially those in the energy and mining sectors where volatility in commodity prices or consolidation of capacity could adversely affect customer demand; \n \u00b7 excessive periods of rain or drought can impact primary demand; \n \u00b7 destruction caused by floods, tropical storms and hurricanes which can impact primary demand as well as cause delays in collections from our customers; \n \u00b7 the non-renewal of contracts by customers; \n \u00b7 various environmental factors and natural or man-made conditions impacting the quality of source water, such as bacteria levels or contaminants in source water, can require additional pretreatment thus adding cost and reducing the level of production throughput; and \n \u00b7 technological advances especially in new filtration technologies, reverse osmosis membranes, energy recovery equipment and energy efficient plant designs may affect future operating performance and the cost competitiveness of our services in the market. \nFor our wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions, we utilize a modular design that enables us to expand capacity with increasing customer demand. The plants are designed to treat peak volumes of wastewater produced by our customers. Our customer's demand for our wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions can vary among quarters and annual periods for a variety of reasons over which we have little control, including:\n \u00b7 individual developers or customers inability to procure funding to initiate building or expanding certain residential developments; \n \u00b7 residential development specific construction delays such as weather-related delays, changes in specifications or inability of ancillary contractors to preform works; \n \u00b7 downturns in the general economy and housing market that can decrease demand for new housing developments thus limiting increases in demand for wastewater treatment; \n \u00b7 replacement of our solutions by a larger, centralized facility or the connecting of customers to a centralized wastewater treatment or water reuse solution; and \n \u00b7 potential changes in the regulatory environment that could impede development of further decentralized wastewater treatment systems. \nQuench\nAttracting New Customers\nOur performance will be affected by our ability to continue to attract new customers. We believe that the U.S. commercial water cooler market is underpenetrated by POU water filtration, which represented only 11.1% by revenue of a $4.2 billion per year market in 2015. We intend to continue to invest in selling and marketing efforts to attract new customers for our filtered water systems, both within our existing geographic territories and in targeted additional territories in the United States and internationally. Our ability to attract new customers may vary from period to period for several reasons, including the effectiveness of our selling and marketing efforts, our ability to hire and retain salespeople, competitive dynamics, variability in our sales cycle (particularly related to opportunities to serve larger enterprises), the timing of the roll-out of large-enterprise orders and general economic conditions.\nCustomer Relationships\nWe believe that our existing customers continue to provide significant opportunities for us to offer additional products and services. In our direct sales channel, these opportunities include the rental of additional or upgraded water coolers, as well as the rental of equipment from our newer product lines enabled by POU water filtration, such as ice machines, sparkling water coolers and coffee brewers. In addition, we expect to invest to grow the sales of consumables associated with our systems, such as coffee and related consumables, and continue to pursue the resale of equipment to dealers, retailers and end customers who prefer to own, rather than lease, their equipment.\nTypically, we rent our systems to customers on multi-year, automatically-renewing contracts, and we anticipate extending our relationships with existing customers beyond the initial contract term. Some customers terminate their agreements during the agreement term, typically due to financial constraints, and others cancel at the end of the term. Our annual unit attrition rate at December 31, 2019 was less than 7.5%, implying an average rental period of more than 12 years. Our ability to retain our existing customer relationships will affect our performance and is affected by a number of factors, including the effectiveness of our retention efforts, the quality of our products and service, our pricing, competitive dynamics in the industry, product availability, and the health of the economy. In addition, the non-\nrecurring revenue from the sale of equipment, coffee and consumables, is less predictable and can change based on fluctuations in demand in a specific period.\nStrategic Acquisitions\nThe POU water filtration industry is highly fragmented, with a large number of local competitors and several larger regional operators. Quench has completed 20 acquisitions since our initial public offering, of which 8 have occurred since the beginning of 2019. We believe our recent acquisition activity is indicative of the opportunity for future inorganic growth.\nThrough our indirect sales channel, we offer POU systems to networks of approximately 260 dealers and retailers predominantly in North America. The indirect sales channel expands our participation in the growing POU market domestically and internationally. In addition, the channel enhances our ability to develop, source and manufacture innovative, exclusive coolers and purification offerings. Lastly, the channel offers us the opportunity to develop deeper relationships with POU dealers that could lead to future acquisitions.\nWe expect to continue to pursue select acquisitions to increase our scale, customer density and geographic service area, as well as to increase our participation in the broader international market for POU systems. Our ability to complete acquisitions is a function of many factors, including competition, purchase price and our short-term business priorities. Accordingly, it is impossible to predict whether any current or future discussions will lead to the successful completion of any acquisitions. Since acquisitions are a part of our growth strategy, the inability to complete, integrate and profitably operate acquisitions may adversely affect our operating results.\nChanges to Cost of Sales and Operating Expenses\nProfitability of our Quench platform will be affected by our ability to control our costs of sales and operating expenses.\nA majority of Quench rental agreements are priced at fixed rates for multi-year periods ranging up to four years. As a result, our gross margins are exposed to potential cost of sales increases that cannot be immediately offset by price adjustments. The volume, mix and pricing of equipment and consumables purchased for immediate resale (as opposed to rental) can impact the consistency and comparability of our results. The overall compensation of field service and supply chain support (along with the costs of associated vehicles), may affect our gross margins.\nQuench incurs selling, general and administrative costs to support a North American sales force, a widely dispersed installed base of customers, and a high volume of recurring business transactions. A portion of such costs is composed of new customer acquisition costs, such as lead generation expenses, which are expensed upfront and recovered over the periods following the execution of a customer contract and any subsequent renewal. Commissions and other costs that are directly related to the negotiation and execution of leases, considered contract acquisition costs, are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the contract period. Selling, general and administrative costs also include certain costs to complete business acquisitions, which precede the realization of revenues generated by the acquired new business, and discretionary investments in infrastructure to support our plans for Quench's future long-term growth. The timing of these expenditures and their impact relative to the revenues generated can affect our performance and comparability of results.\nCorporate and Other\nChanges to Operating Expenses\nWe expect to incur increased legal, accounting and other expenses as we pursue our expansion strategy and as a public company, including costs resulting from public company reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act\u201d), and the listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange. We anticipate that such operating costs as a percentage of revenue will moderate over the long-term if and as our revenues increase or as a result of certain other corporate activities or projects.\nPresentation of Financial Information\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). In the preparation of these consolidated financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses and related disclosures. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or operating results would be affected. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates, which we discuss below.\nAdoption of New Accounting Pronouncements\nUnder the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act, we meet the definition of an emerging growth company.\u201d We have irrevocably elected to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance regarding implementation of measurement of credit losses on financial instruments. This guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those annual periods, and early adoption is permitted. We adopted this guidance on a modified retrospective basis on January 1, 2019 with the cumulative effect of transition as of the effective date of adoption. For a discussion on the impacts of the authoritative guidance on our financial statements, please refer to Note 2- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn March 2019, the FASB issued authoritative guidance regarding targeted changes to lessor accounting. This guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those annual periods, and early adoption is permitted. We adopted this guidance on a retrospective basis as of January 1, 2019 (the original adoption date of the lease pronouncement). For a discussion on the impacts of the authoritative guidance on our financial statements, please refer to Note 2- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued authoritative guidance regarding leases that requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and right of use asset for operating leases, with the exception of short-term leases. In addition, lessor accounting was modified to align, where necessary, with lessee accounting modifications and the authoritative guidance regarding revenue from contracts with customers. During 2018, the FASB issued additional authoritative guidance which, among other things, provided an option to apply transition provisions under the standard at adoption date rather than the earliest comparative period presented as well as added a practical expedient that would permit lessors to not separate non-lease components from the associated lease components if certain conditions are met. These amendments are effective, in conjunction with the new lease standard, for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those annual periods.\nWe adopted this guidance on a modified retrospective basis on January 1, 2019 with the cumulative effect of transition as of the effective date of adoption. For a discussion on the impacts of the authoritative guidance on our financial statements, please refer to Note 2- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements to be Adopted\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued authoritative guidance regarding implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract. This guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those annual periods, and early adoption is permitted. We adopted this guidance on January 1, 2020 on a prospective basis. Although certain implementation costs we incur going forward may now be capitalizable, there is no material impact expected to the consolidated financial statements as a result of this adoption.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued authoritative guidance regarding fair value measurements. This guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those annual periods, and early adoption is permitted. We adopted this guidance on January 1, 2020 on a prospective basis. Beginning with all periods subsequent to the adoption date, we will prepare the enhanced disclosures within the consolidated financial statements as a result of this adoption.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments used. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. In making estimates and judgments, management employs critical accounting policies.\nOur significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.\nLeases\nLessee accounting\nWe lease space and operating assets, including offices, office equipment, warehouses, storage yards and storage units under non-cancelable operating leases. We account for these leases in accordance with the authoritative guidance adopted as of January 1, 2019. Please see Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements\u201d section above for information regarding this adoption.\nAt contract inception, we determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease. If the arrangement contains a lease, we recognize a right-of-use asset and an operating lease liability at the lease commencement date. Lease expense for lease payments made is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nThe operating lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments at the lease commencement date. The current portion of our operating lease liabilities are recorded within accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which is comprised of the initial amount of the operating lease liability adjusted for lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred less any lease incentives received. The right-of-use asset is subsequently measured throughout the lease term at the carrying amount of the operating lease liability, plus initial direct costs, plus (minus) any prepaid (accrued) lease payments, less the unamortized balance of lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets are periodically reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances arise.\nKey estimates and judgments in determining both the operating lease liability and right-of-use asset include the determination of (i) the discount rate it uses to discount the unpaid lease payments to present value, (ii) the lease term and (iii) the lease payments.\nThe discount rate applied to the unpaid lease payments is the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, our incremental borrowing rate. Generally, we cannot determine the interest rate implicit in the lease because we do not have access to the lessor's estimated residual value or the amount of the lessor's deferred initial direct costs. Therefore, we generally derive an incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate for the lease. Our incremental borrowing rate for a lease is the rate of interest we would have to pay on a collateralized basis to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments under similar terms.\nThe lease term for all of our leases includes the noncancelable period of the lease, plus any additional periods covered by either our option to extend (or not to terminate) the lease that we are reasonably certain to exercise, and/or an option to extend (or not to terminate) the lease controlled by the lessor.\nLease payments included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities are comprised of the following:\n \u00b7 fixed payments; \n \u00b7 variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate, initially measured using the index or rate at the lease commencement date; and \n \u00b7 the exercise price of our option to purchase the underlying asset if we are reasonably certain to exercise the option. \nIn certain instances, our leases include non-lease components, such as equipment maintenance or common area maintenance. As part of its adoption of authoritative guidance on leases on January 1, 2019, we have not elected the practical expedient to account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component and have elected (for all classes of underlying assets) to account for these components separately. We have allocated the consideration in the contract to the lease and non-lease components based on each component's relative standalone price. We determine standalone prices for the lease components based on the prices for which other lessors lease similar assets on a standalone basis. We determine standalone prices for the non-lease components based on the prices that suppliers might charge for those type of services on a standalone basis. If observable standalone prices are not readily available, we estimate the standalone prices maximizing the use of observable information.\nWe have elected to utilize the short-term lease exemption and not recognize a right-of-use asset and corresponding operating lease liability for leases with expected terms of 12 months or less. We recognize the lease payments associated with its short-term leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nLessor accounting\nWe generate revenues through the lease of our bulk water facilities, wastewater treatment and water reuse equipment, and filtered water and related systems equipment to customers. In certain instances, we enter into a contract with a customer but must construct the underlying asset, including bulk water facilities and wastewater treatment and water reuse equipment, prior to its lease.\nAt the time of contract inception, we determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease.\nCustomer contracts that contain leases, which can be explicit or implicit in the contract, are generally classified as either operating leases or sales-type leases and can contain both lease and non-lease components, including operating and maintenance services ( O&M\u201d) of the Company-owned equipment. As part of our adoption of authoritative guidance on leases on January 1, 2019, we elected the practical expedient for all classes of underlying assets to not separate the lease and non-lease components if certain conditions are met, including the classification of the lease component as operating and the revenue recognition pattern of both the lease and non-lease components. We will account for the contract with the customer as a combined component under the respective authoritative guidance for the predominant element in the contract, the lease or non-lease component.\nFor leases classified as sales-type leases, we allocate the transaction price based on the relative standalone selling prices of the identified performance obligations.\nIf the customer contract contains or is accounted for as a lease, the key estimates and judgments used in accounting for the lease as a lessor include the following: (i) lease term, (ii) the economic life of the underlying leased\nasset, (iii) determination of lease payments and (iv) determination of the fair value at the time of contract inception and the residual value of the underlying leased asset.\nThe lease term for all of our leases includes the noncancelable period of the lease, plus any additional periods covered by either a lessee option to extend (or not to terminate) the lease that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise, and/or an option to extend (or not to terminate) the lease controlled by us. Contracts entered into with customers can include either the option to renew or an auto-renewing provision that results in the automatic extension of the existing contract. In certain instances, key provisions such as the lease payment and term of the renewal are not stated and are subject to renewal.\nThe economic life of the underlying leased asset is determined to be either the period over which the asset is expected to be economically usable, or where the benefits it can produce exceed the cost to replace or undertake major repairs. In certain instances, the economic life of the underlying leased asset can exceed the useful life we assign.\nLease payments that are accounted for as rental revenue are comprised of the following:\n \u00b7 fixed payments; \n \u00b7 variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate, initially measured using the index or rate at the lease commencement date; \n \u00b7 the exercise price of a lessee option to purchase the underlying asset if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise the option; and \n \u00b7 payments for penalties for the termination of a lease if the term reflects the lessee terminating the lease. \nOur leases do not typically include a requirement for the customer to guarantee the residual value of the underlying leased asset. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or rate are excluded from the determination of lease payments.\nThe fair value of the underlying leased asset at contract inception and residual value of underlying leased asset at the end of the term of the lease are determined based on the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction at the time of valuation. Our risk management strategy for protecting the residual value of the underlying assets include our ongoing maintenance during the lease term as well as clauses and other protections within the lease agreements which require the lessee to return the underlying asset in working condition at the end of the lease term.\nAt contract inception, we determine the lease classification of the underlying asset. We consider inputs such as the lease term, lease payments, fair value of the underlying asset and residual value of the underlying asset when assessing the classification. The discount rate applied to the unpaid lease payments is the interest rate implicit in the lease. The rate implicit in the lease is the rate of interest that, at a given date, causes the aggregate present value of (a) the lease payments and (b) the amount that the we expect to derive from the underlying asset following the end of the lease term to equal the sum of (1) the fair value of the underlying asset minus any related investment tax credit retained and expected to be realized and (2) any deferred initial direct costs we incur.\nIn certain instances, contracts with customers may also include the option for the customer to purchase the underlying asset at the end of the lease term. When applicable and certain conditions are met, we will incorporate the stated purchase price into the determination of the interest rate implied in the lease.\nRecoverable Amount of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill associated with our business combinations has been and is expected to continue increasing in the future as further acquisitions are completed. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter and more frequently if a change in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicates that potential impairment exists. We first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If it is determined to be more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we perform the quantitative analysis of the goodwill impairment test. Otherwise, the quantitative test is optional.\nUnder the quantitative analysis, the recoverability of goodwill is measured at each reporting unit by comparing the reporting unit's carrying amount, including goodwill, to the fair market value of the reporting unit. We determine the fair market value of our reporting units based on a weighting of the present value of projected future cash flows, which we refer to as the Income Approach, and a comparative market approach under both the guideline company method and guideline transaction method, which we refer to as the Market Approach. Fair market value using the Income Approach is based on our estimated future cash flows on a discounted basis. The Market Approach compares each of our reporting units to other comparable companies based on valuation multiples derived from operational and transactional data to arrive at a fair value. Factors requiring significant judgment include, among others, the determination of comparable companies, assumptions related to forecasted operating results, discount rates, long-term growth rates, and market multiples. Changes in economic or operating conditions, or changes in our business strategies, that occur after the annual impairment analysis and which impact these assumptions, may result in a future goodwill impairment charge, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements.\nIn determining its reporting units, the Company reviews its operating segments to determine the number of components within each segment. If an operating segment contains only a single component, the operating segment is deemed a reporting unit. If an operating segment contains more than one component, the Company aggregates into a single reporting unit those components determined to have similar economic characteristics. Components determined to have dissimilar economic characteristics are considered a separate reporting unit. As of both December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Quench segment was determined to be composed of a single reporting unit. As of both December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Seven Seas Water segment was determined to be composed of two reporting units.\nFor the 2019 and 2018 goodwill impairment assessments, we performed a qualitative assessment of each reporting unit that existed at the time of the impairment assessment. Based upon the qualitative assessments, it was determined that there was substantial evidence that it was more likely than not that the fair value for each reporting unit were more than the carrying values. As such, no quantitative assessment was deemed necessary.\nOther intangible assets consist of certain trade names, customer relationships and non-compete agreements. Intangible assets which have a finite life are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis. Customer relationships which have a finite life are amortized on an accelerated basis based on the projected economic value of the asset over its useful life. Intangible assets with a finite life are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which consist of certain trade names, are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the asset may be impaired. No impairment was recorded during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nBusiness Combinations\nIn accordance with accounting for business combinations, we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill.\nOur purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. Management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices, the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses. Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates.\nThe valuation of net assets acquired in a business combination determines the allocation of purchase price to specific assets and the subsequent recognition of expense. A change in our estimate of the value assigned to intangibles or a change in our estimate of useful life for the intangibles could impact the amount of amortization expense recorded in any period. A 10% change in the amortization expense recorded for the year ended December 31, 2019 would have impacted our pre-tax net loss by approximately $2.3 million.\nIf an acquisition does not meet the definition of a business combination, then we account for the transaction as an asset acquisition. In an asset acquisition, goodwill is not recognized, but rather any excess consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired is allocated on a relative fair value basis to the identifiable net assets. In addition, transaction-related expenses are capitalized and allocated to the net assets acquired on a relative fair value basis.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe account for share-based compensation by measuring the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value. The cost is recognized over the requisite service period, net of adjustments for forfeitures as they occur.\nWe have several equity award plans, including plans which were established prior to the corporate reorganization and IPO and one which became effective upon the effectiveness of the IPO. See Note 12- Share-based Compensation\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a complete discussion on all our equity award plans.\nWe expense the fair value of share-based compensation awards over the requisite service period, which is typically the vesting period. The expense is then adjusted for forfeitures as they occur. We estimate the grant date fair value of options and other equity awards with hurdle rates using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model that requires management to apply judgment and make estimates, including:\n \u00b7 expected volatility, which is calculated based on reported volatility data for a representative group of publicly traded companies for which historical information is available. Because we only recently completed our IPO, we have continued to use an average of expected volatility based on the volatilities of a representative group of publicly traded companies for a period approximating the expected term of the grant; \n \u00b7 the risk-free interest rate, which is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect on the date of grant commensurate with the expected term assumption; \n \u00b7 expected term, which we calculate using the simplified method, as we have insufficient historical information regarding our equity awards to provide a basis for an estimate; \n \u00b7 fair value of the underlying securities, which is determined using the option-pricing model or by reasonably contemporaneous arm's length transactions prior to our IPO and closing prices as reported by the New York Stock Exchange on or after the IPO; and \n \u00b7 dividend yield, which is zero based on the fact that we never paid cash dividends and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. \nPrior to our IPO, there were significant judgments and estimates inherent in the determination of the fair value of our shares. These judgments and estimates included assumptions regarding our future operating performance, the time to completing an initial public offering, or other liquidity event, the related company valuations associated with such events, and the determinations of the appropriate valuation methods. If we had made different assumptions, our share-based compensation expense and net loss could have been significantly different. A 10% change in share-based compensation expense recorded for the year ended December 31, 2019 would have impacted our pre-tax net loss by approximately $0.5 million.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach to the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. We are required to exercise judgment with respect to the realization of our net deferred tax assets. Management evaluates all positive and negative evidence and exercises judgment regarding past and future events to determine if it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets may not be realized. If appropriate, a valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that\nmay not be realized. We evaluate tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in our tax returns, and we record a liability for uncertain tax positions. We use a two-step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions. First, tax positions are recognized if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. Second, tax positions are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nAquaVenture Holdings Limited is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, which does not impose income taxes. Certain of our subsidiaries file separate tax returns and are subject to federal income taxes at the corporate level in the United States or in foreign jurisdictions. Certain other subsidiaries operate in jurisdictions that do not impose taxes based on income.\nVarious internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable, material or immaterial effects on our effective income tax rate and therefore, impact net income and earnings per share. These factors include, but are not limited to changes in tax rates; changes in tax laws, regulations and rulings; changes in interpretations of existing laws, regulations and rulings; changes in the evaluation of our ability to realize deferred tax assets, and changes in accounting principles; changes in current pre-tax income as well as changes in forecasted pre-tax income; changes in the mix of earnings among countries with different tax rates; and acquisitions and changes in our corporate structure. These factors may result in periodic revisions to our effective income tax rate, which could affect our cash flow and results of operations. We recorded a valuation allowance of $28.5 million as of December 31, 2019 related primarily to net operating losses.\nA 0.50% change in our effective income tax rate would have impacted our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2019 by approximately $0.1 million.\nResults of Operations\nWe have omitted discussion of the earliest of the three years covered by our consolidated financial statements presented in this report because that disclosure was already included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, as amended. You are encouraged to reference Part II, Item 7, within that report, as amended, for a discussion of our financial condition and result of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe operating expenses of the parent, AquaVenture Holdings Limited, are reported separately from the two operating and reportable segments below. See Operating Segments\u201d located in the Overview\u201d section above for more information.\nThe following table sets forth the components of our consolidated statements of operations and

December 31, 2018 through a combination of organic and inorganic growth. In calculating organic and inorganic revenue growth, (i) organic growth represents estimated revenue from operations that existed in both the current and comparable periods, and (ii) inorganic growth includes the estimated revenue from acquisitions for the 12 months following an acquisition and any revenue contributions from divested businesses for the months in the prior year period in which the business did not exist in the current year period.\nSeven Seas Water revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $21.9 million, or 33.0%, compared to the same period of 2018, which were comprised of 31.2% inorganic growth and 1.8% organic growth. Bulk water revenues increased $3.2 million, or 5.6%, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to: (i) increases of $1.4 million from our USVI operations and $0.7 million from our St. Maarten operations due to higher production volumes compared to the same period of 2018; (ii) an increase of $1.3 million in connection with the commencement of our water contract in Anguilla; and (iii) an increase of $0.4 million in our BVI operations driven by increases in the water rate compared to the prior year. This was partially offset by $0.3 million lower revenue in our Peru operations primarily due to revenue received in the prior year in connection with non-routine services performed for the customer. Rental revenues and product sales increased $12.5 million and $6.6 million, respectively, primarily due to the inclusion of the AUC operations which were acquired in November 2018.\nQuench revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $36.0 million, or 45.4%, compared to the same period of 2018, which were comprised of 31.8% of inorganic growth and 13.6% organic growth. The prior year period included $3.5 million of revenue from the Atlas High Purity Solutions business that was divested in October 2018. Rental revenues increased $17.6 million, or 28.4%, compared to the prior year period, which was comprised of 20.5% inorganic net growth from acquisitions and 7.9% of organic growth due to additional units placed under new leases in excess of unit attrition. Product sales increased $18.4 million compared to the prior year, which included $12.8 million of inorganic net growth primarily due to the acquisitions of PHSI and Bluline in December 2018, and $5.6 million of organic growth driven by higher indirect dealer equipment sales and coffee sales.\nGross margin\nThe following table presents the major components of cost of revenues, gross profit and gross margin for our two operating segments:\nTable 166: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPercent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGross Margin:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSeven Seas Water\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBulk water\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n54.2\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n53.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRental\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n67.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n74.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(7.7)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProduct sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n17.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2.5)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFinancing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal Seven Seas Water\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n54.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n55.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1.7)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nQuench\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRental\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n52.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n55.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3.0)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProduct sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n40.2\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n35.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.2\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal Quench\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n48.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n51.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2.4)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal gross margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n51.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n53.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased 210 basis points to 51.1% from 53.2% in the prior year period.\nSeven Seas Water gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased 170 basis points to 54.0% compared to 55.7% in the prior year. Bulk water gross margin of 54.2% increased 50 basis points compared to 53.7% in the prior year primarily due to higher revenues in our BVI and USVI operations without a commensurate increase in costs. This was partially offset by a decrease in gross margin at our Trinidad operations due to a depreciation expense adjustment in the prior year in connection with a purchase price refund received on in-service equipment. Rental gross margin of 67.0% decreased from 74.7% in the prior year primarily due to additional depreciation expense on property, plant and equipment related to the finalization of purchase accounting for the AUC acquisition. Product sales gross margin of 15.0% decreased from 17.5% in the prior year period primarily due to higher contributions from lower-margin contracts compared to the prior year.\nQuench gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased 240 basis points to 48.8% from 51.2% for the same period of 2018. Rental gross margin of 52.7% decreased from 55.7% in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenue related to additional units placed on lease, partially offset by lower compensation and benefits as a percentage of revenues due to continued leveraging of the platform. Product sales gross margin increased to 40.2% for the year ended December 31, 2019 from 35.0% in the prior year, primarily driven by the higher-margin indirect PHSI dealer equipment sales.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nThe following table presents selling, general and administrative, or SG&A, expenses for our operating segments:\nTable 167: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPercent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSeven Seas Water\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n24,974\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n30,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(5,169)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(17.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nQuench\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n59,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n48,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10,910\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n22.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCorporate and Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11,432\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,832\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n136.6\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n95,986\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n83,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n12,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $12.3 million, or 14.8%, compared to the same period of 2018.\nSeven Seas Water SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $5.2 million to $25.0 million compared to the prior year, which was primarily due to (i) a decrease of $4.4 million in share-based compensation expense driven by the completion of the vesting of certain equity grants made in connection with our initial public offering in 2016, (ii) a $3.0 million net gain on sale of property, plant and equipment primarily in connection with our customer in Cura\u00e7ao exercising its right to purchase the desalination facilities pursuant to the water supply agreement, and (iii) $1.6 million of lower professional fees primarily due to elevated costs in the prior year related to the acquisition of the AUC operations in November 2018. Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase of $3.2 million in amortization expense of definite lived intangible assets and $0.3 million higher compensation and benefits expense primarily due to the acquisition of the AUC operations in November 2018. Seven Seas Water SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decline compared to 45.4% for the same period of 2018.\nQuench SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $10.9 million to $59.6 million compared to the prior year. The increase was driven by $6.5 million higher amortization expense primarily related to an increase in intangible assets from recent acquisitions, $4.1 million higher compensation and benefits primarily driven by increased headcount from the inclusion of staff added from certain acquisitions and a $1.3 million increase in general expenses primarily to support the expansion of our operations. Partially offsetting this increase was $1.5 million lower acquisition-related expenses and $0.8 million lower restructuring costs primarily incurred in connection with the PHSI acquisition in December 2018, and a $1.4 million decrease in share-based compensation expense driven by the completion of the vesting of certain equity grants made in connection with our initial public offering in 2016. Quench SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue were 51.7% for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decline compared to 61.5% for the same period of 2018.\nCorporate and Other SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $6.6 million to $11.4 million compared to the same period of 2018, which was driven by $6.6 million of expenses incurred in connection with the definitive merger agreement entered into in December 2019.\nCommencing on December 18, 2018, the Company initiated a restructuring of the PHSI organization which included the reduction of headcount for PHSI executive management and other employee positions determined to be duplicative with those at Quench (the PHSI Restructuring Plan\u201d). Certain of the positions were backfilled with additional positions at Quench depending on the needs of the business. The expected net effect of the restructuring allowed Quench to recognize synergies of reduced employee costs subsequent to the PHSI Acquisition. The restructuring was determined to be a post-combination transaction. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company incurred an incremental restructuring-related charge related to severance, termination benefits and related taxes of $0.1 million and $0.9 million, respectively, which was recorded within SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had accrued approximately $0 and $0.8 million, respectively, within accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, we incurred a consolidated pre-tax loss of $22.0 million, which was composed of: (i) an aggregate of $29.3 million of pre-tax losses in jurisdictions which either do not impose an income tax or we do not believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of such losses and (ii) an aggregate of $7.3 million of pre-tax income in taxable jurisdictions.\nIncome tax (benefit) expense for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $2.2 million and $(1.3) million, respectively. Income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were composed of a current tax of $3.2 million and $2.0 million, respectively, and deferred tax (benefit) expense of $(1.0) million and $(3.3) million, respectively. The increase in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period\nin 2018 was primarily the result of the recognition $3.4 million tax benefit recorded in the prior year for the full release of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in one of our foreign jurisdictions, a gain recorded on the sale of assets in Curacao and an increase in current expense related to withholding taxes. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in income tax expense for our other jurisdictions due to lower taxable income in certain tax paying jurisdictions.\nCash paid for income taxes was $2.3 million and $1.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, our principal sources of liquidity on a consolidated basis were cash and cash equivalents of $103.3 million and $56.6 million, respectively (excluding restricted cash), which were held for working capital, investment and general corporate purposes. In addition, as of both December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had an aggregate of $4.2 million of restricted cash related to debt service reserve funds and minimum balance requirements for one of our borrowings. See Note 2- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Restricted Cash\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our working capital as of December 31, 2019 was $115.2 million compared to $64.6 million as of December 31, 2018.\nIn July 2019, we completed an underwritten sale of 4.7 million ordinary shares at a public offering price of $16.88 per share. We received net proceeds of $75.4 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.\nOur cash and cash equivalents are held by our holding company and our subsidiaries primarily in demand deposits with domestic and international banks, money market accounts, and U.S. Treasury bills. We utilize a combination of equity financing and corporate and project debt financing through international commercial banks and other financial institutions to fund our cash needs and the growth of our business. Our debt financing arrangements contain financial covenants and provisions which govern distributions by the borrowers may limit our ability to transfer cash among us and our subsidiaries. See Note 10- Long-Term Debt-Restricted Net Assets\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a summary of limitations applicable to us and our subsidiaries as of December 31, 2019. Based on our current level of operations, we believe our cash flow from operations and available cash will be adequate to meet the future liquidity needs of our current operations for at least the next twelve months.\nOur expected future liquidity and capital requirements consist principally of:\n \u00b7 capital expenditures and investments in infrastructure under concession arrangements related to maintaining or expanding our existing operations; \n \u00b7 development of new projects and new markets; \n \u00b7 inventory; \n \u00b7 acquisitions; \n \u00b7 costs and expenses relating to our ongoing business operations; and \n \u00b7 debt service requirements on our existing and future debt. \nOur ability to meet our debt service obligations and other capital requirements, including capital expenditures, as well as future acquisitions, will depend on our future operating performance which, in turn, will be subject to general economic, financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other conditions, many of which are beyond our control.\nWe may in the future be required to seek additional equity or debt financing to meet these future capital and liquidity requirements. If additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired or needed, our business, operating results, cash flow and financial condition would be adversely affected. We currently intend to use our available funds and any future cash flow from operations for the conduct and expansion of our business, debt service requirements and general corporate purposes.\nSubsidiary Distribution Policy\nA significant portion of our cash flow is provided by operations from our principal operating subsidiaries and borrowings made at the corporate level.\nWith respect to our Seven Seas Water segment, unless cash balances are expected to be redeployed for further growth opportunities in the same jurisdiction, our distribution policy is to efficiently distribute cash from our international operating subsidiaries to our non-U.S. intermediate holding companies for redeployment in the manner intended to optimize our return on invested capital. However, one of our subsidiaries, as of December 31, 2019, has a loan agreement that restricts distributions to related parties in the event certain financial or nonfinancial covenants are not met, which could reduce our ability to redeploy cash. Distributions are typically in the form of principal and interest payments on intercompany loans, repayment of intercompany advances or other intercompany arrangements, including billings from our Tampa operations center, and dividends. When considering the amount and timing of such distributions, our Seven Seas Water operating subsidiaries must maintain sufficient funds for future capital investment, debt service and general working capital purposes.\nWith respect to our Quench operating segment, our current intent is for Quench to retain cash for working capital, investment for future growth within the segment and for future debt repayment.\nAlthough the governing boards of our subsidiaries have discretion over intercompany dividends or other future distributions, the form, frequency and amount of such distributions will depend on our subsidiaries' future operations and earnings, capital requirements and surplus, general financial condition, contractual requirements of our lenders, tax considerations and other factors that may be deemed relevant.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the following periods:\nTable 176: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n31,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n26,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(52,468)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(214,540)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n68,180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n126,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEffect of exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(25)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n46,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(61,588)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nThe significant variations of cash provided by operating activities and net losses are principally related to adjustments to eliminate non-cash and non-operating charges including, but not limited to, amortization, depreciation, share-based compensation, changes in the deferred income tax provision, charges related to the disposal of assets and impairment charges. The largest source of operating cash flow is the collection of trade receivables and our largest use of cash flows is the payment of costs associated with revenue and SG&A expenses.\nCash provided by operations during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $31.0 million and $26.9 million, respectively. The increase in cash flow from operations was primarily due to overall higher operating cash inflows driven by the large acquisitions in late 2018 which was partially offset by higher cash interest expense related to incremental borrowings of $150 million in connection with the expansions of our senior secured credit agreement in November and December 2018.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $52.5 million and $214.6 million, respectively. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to a decrease of $178.8 million of net cash paid for acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the prior year period. This was partially offset by an increase of $17.0 million in capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the prior year period.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash paid for acquisitions was $19.7 million as compared to $198.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 there were $21.0 million and $3.5 million, respectively, of capital expenditures by Seven Seas Water primarily for new plants, plant expansions and capacity upgrades and $15.6 million and $16.1 million, respectively, of capital expenditures for Quench primarily to support existing operations.\nCapital Expenditures on Fixed Assets and Investments in Long-Lived Assets\nFor Seven Seas Water, our primary capital expenditures are composed of construction costs of our plants, including engineering, procurement and construction and equipment costs, internal direct labor and project development costs, which include engineering and environmental studies, permitting and licensing and certain legal costs. Major repairs and maintenance, which improve the efficiency or extend the life of our operating plants, are also included in capital expenditures. In addition to our contractually committed capital expenditures, we routinely explore project investment opportunities in our current and new geographic locations and business lines if we believe that any of the opportunities has the potential to meet our internal investment criteria. In the course of pursuing these investment opportunities, we may successfully bid on projects or operating plants that will require additional capital expenditures. For Quench, our primary capital expenditures are the acquisition of POU systems and related assets as well as typical capital expenditures for leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, computers, field tablets and software.\nFor the fiscal year 2020, we expect to invest approximately $27 million across our Seven Seas Water and Quench segments in capital expenditures, primarily to support growth opportunities. We expect that these investments will be financed through existing cash and cash generated from operations.\nSignificant 2019 Acquisitions\nOn June 1, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Aguaman for an aggregate purchase price of $1.5 million. On July 15, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Carolina Pure for an aggregate purchase price of $7.3 million. On October 1, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Mirex for an aggregate purchase price of $11.6 million.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $68.2 million and $126.1 million, respectively. The $57.8 million net decrease in cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to a decrease of $150.0 million of net proceeds from long-term debt related to incremental borrowings in connection with the expansions of our senior secured credit agreement in November and December 2018. This decrease was partially offset by net proceeds of $75.4 million received in connection with issuance of 4.7 million ordinary shares at a public offering price of $16.88 per share in July 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, long-term debt included the following (in thousands):\nTable 177: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCorporate Credit Agreement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBVI Loan Agreement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14,838\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n20,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nVehicle financing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal face value of long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n318,174\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n322,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFace value of long-term debt, current\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,520\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n6,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLess: Current portion of unamortized debt discounts and deferred financing fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(29)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(42)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCurrent portion of long-term debt, net of debt discounts and deferred financing fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n6,494\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFace value of long-term debt, non-current\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n310,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n315,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLess: Non-current portion of unamortized debt discounts and deferred financing fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,550)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2,559)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLong-term debt, net of debt discounts and deferred financing fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n309,104\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n313,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCorporate Credit Agreement\nOn August 4, 2017, AquaVenture Holdings Limited, AquaVenture Holdings Peru S.A.C., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and Quench USA, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, (collectively the Borrowers\u201d) entered into a $150.0 million senior secured credit agreement (the Corporate Credit Agreement\u201d) with a syndicate of lenders. The Corporate Credit Agreement is non-amortizing, matures in August 2021, at the time it was incurred, bore interest at LIBOR plus 6.0% with a LIBOR floor of 1.0%. Interest only payments are due quarterly with principal due in full upon maturity.\nOn November 17, 2017, the Corporate Credit Agreement was amended to convert the interest rate applicable to 50% of the then-outstanding principal balance, or $75.0 million, from a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus 6.0% with a LIBOR floor of 1.0% to a fixed rate of 8.2%. The remaining 50% of the then-outstanding principal balance, of $75.0 million, continued to bear interest at LIBOR plus 6.0% with a LIBOR floor of 1.0%. All other material terms of the original credit agreement remained substantially unchanged.\nOn August 28, 2018, the Corporate Credit Agreement was amended to modify certain agreement definitions and non-financial covenants. All other material terms of the original credit agreement remained substantially unchanged.\nOn November 1, 2018, the Corporate Credit Agreement was amended ( Amended Corporate Credit Agreement\u201d) to: (i) add AquaVenture Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, as a borrower under the Amended Corporate Credit Agreement, (ii) increase our net borrowings by $110.0 million to an aggregate principal amount of $260.0 million, (iii) reduce the interest rate for the original $150.0 million borrowings by 50 basis points on both the variable and fixed interest portions and (iv) amend certain financial covenant requirements. Of the incremental net borrowing of $110.0 million, $70.0 million bears interest at a variable rate of LIBOR plus 5.5% with a LIBOR floor of 1.0%, and the remaining $40.0 million bears interest at a fixed rate of 8.7%. In the aggregate, including the aforementioned interest rate reduction, $145.0 million of borrowings bear interest at a variable rate of LIBOR plus 5.5% with a LIBOR floor of 1.0% and the remaining $115.0 million of borrowings bear interest at a weighted average fixed rate of 8.0%. A declining prepayment fee on the incremental borrowing was due upon repayment if it occurred prior to November 1, 2019. All other material terms of the Amended Corporate Credit Agreement remained substantially unchanged.\nOn December 20, 2018, the Corporate Credit Agreement was amended to increase its borrowings by $40.0 million to an aggregate principal amount of $300.0 million. The incremental borrowings bear interest at a variable rate of LIBOR plus 5.5% with a LIBOR floor of 1.0%. A prepayment fee on the incremental borrowing, which declines over time, was due upon repayment if it occurred prior to December 20, 2019. These additional borrowings are non-amortizing and mature in August 2021. All other terms of the Corporate Credit Agreement remained substantially unchanged.\nOn December 10, 2019, the Corporate Credit Agreement was amended to modify certain covenants. All other material terms of the original credit agreement remained substantially unchanged.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the weighted average interest rate was 7.7%.\nThe Corporate Credit Agreement is guaranteed by AquaVenture Holdings Limited along with certain subsidiaries and contains financial and nonfinancial covenants. The financial covenants include minimum interest coverage ratio and maximum leverage ratio requirements, as defined in the Corporate Credit Agreement, and are calculated using consolidated financial information of AquaVenture Holdings Limited excluding the results of AquaVenture (BVI) Holdings Limited and its subsidiary Seven Seas Water (BVI) Limited. In addition, the Corporate Credit Agreement contains customary negative covenants limiting, among other things, indebtedness, investments, liens, dispositions of assets, restricted payments (including dividends), transactions with affiliates, prepayments of indebtedness, capital expenditures, changes in nature of business and amendments to documents. As of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with, or received waivers for breaches of, all such covenants.\nWe may prepay in whole or in part, the outstanding principal and accrued unpaid interest under the Corporate Credit Agreement. The prepayment fee requirement has expired on the original $150.0 million borrowing. The Corporate Credit Agreement is collateralized by certain of the assets of the Borrowers and stated guarantors.\nBVI Loan Agreement\nIn connection with our acquisition of the capital stock of Biwater (BVI) Holdings Limited in June 2015, we inherited the $43.0 million credit facility of its subsidiary, Seven Seas Water (BVI) Ltd., arranged by a bank (the BVI Loan Agreement\u201d). The BVI Loan Agreement closed on November 14, 2013 and was arranged to finance the construction of the 2.8 million GPD desalination facility at Paraquita Bay in Tortola, BVI and other contractual obligations. The BVI Loan Agreement is project financing with recourse only to the stock, assets and cash flow of Seven Seas Water (BVI) Ltd. The BVI Loan Agreement is guaranteed by the United Kingdom Export Finance. As of the acquisition date of June 11, 2015, $40.8 million remained outstanding. In addition, approximately $820 thousand remained available for draw through October 2016. The BVI Loan Agreement was amended on May 7, 2014 and June 11, 2015 to reflect extensions in milestone dates and our acquisition of Seven Seas Water (BVI) Ltd. The BVI Loan Agreement is collateralized by all shares and underlying assets of Seven Seas Water (BVI) Ltd.\nPrior to the amendment on August 4, 2017, the BVI Loan Agreement provided for interest on the outstanding borrowings at LIBOR plus 3.5% per annum and interest was paid quarterly. The loan principal is repayable quarterly beginning in March 31, 2015 in 26 quarterly installments that escalate over the term of the loan.\nOn August 4, 2017, Seven Seas Water (BVI) Ltd. further amended the BVI Loan Agreement to extend the amortization on principal to May 2022 and reduce the spread applied to the LIBOR base rate used in the calculation of interest by 50 basis points to LIBOR plus 3.0% per annum. The United Kingdom Export Finance also extended its participation in the project to match the extended term of the amended BVI Loan Agreement. All other material terms of the original loan agreement remained unchanged.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the weighted-average interest rate was 5.1%. Seven Seas Water (BVI) Ltd. may prepay the principal amounts of the loans prior to the maturity date, in whole or in part.\nThe BVI Loan Agreement includes both financial and nonfinancial covenants, limits the amount of additional indebtedness that Seven Seas Water (BVI) Ltd. can incur and places annual limits on capital expenditures for this subsidiary. The BVI Loan Agreement also places restrictions on distributions made by Seven Seas Water (BVI) Ltd. which is only permitted to make distributions to shareholders and affiliates of AquaVenture Holdings Limited if specified debt service coverage and loan life coverage ratios are met and it is in compliance with all loan covenants. The BVI Loan Agreement contains a number of negative covenants restricting, among other things, indebtedness, investments, liens, dispositions of assets, restricted payments (including dividends), mergers and acquisitions, accounting changes, transactions with affiliates, prepayments of indebtedness, capital expenditures, and changes in nature of business and joint ventures. In addition, Seven Seas Water (BVI) Ltd is subject to quarterly financial covenant compliance, including minimum debt service and loan life coverage ratios, and must maintain a minimum debt service reserve fund and a maintenance reserve fund with the bank in addition to other minimum balance requirements as set forth in the agreement. As of December 31, 2019, Seven Seas Water (BVI) Ltd. was in compliance with, or received waivers for breaches of, all such covenants.\nOther Debt\nWe finance our vehicles primarily under three-year terms with interest rates per annum ranging from 3.0% to 4.5%.\nContractual Obligations and Other Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and other commitments as of December 31, 2019:\nTable 178: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPayments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLess Than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1 to 3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3 to 5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMore Than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nContractual Obligations and Other Commitments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLong-term debt at face value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,520\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n310,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n318,174\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest on long-term debt (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n23,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n58,174\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n81,975\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating leases(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,615\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,575\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n16,102\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAsset retirement obligations (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAcquisition contingent consideration (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,370\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n37,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n374,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n5,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n420,168\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) We calculated interest on long-term debt based on payment terms that existed at December 31, 2019.

We have included the total undiscounted asset retirement obligation, as determined at December 31, 2019, in the table above. \n (4) Acquisition contingent consideration represents the additional purchase price that is contingent on the future performance of an acquired business or collection of certain acquired receivables. We have included the fair value of the total expected amount as of December 31, 2019. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt December 31, 2019, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nOther Matters\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits of $0.7 million and $4.6 million, respectively. Of these amounts, $0.1 million and $3.9 of the Company's unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, have been recorded as a reduction to the related deferred tax asset for the net operating loss in accordance with the FASB issued authoritative guidance relating to the presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists for all periods. The remaining $0.6 million and $0.7 million of the Company's unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, are fully indemnified pursuant to purchase agreements for business combinations and, if realized, would impact the effective tax rate. In addition, the amount of accumulated penalties and interest related to the unrecognized tax benefit was $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded, in the aggregate, an accrued liability of $0.9 million and $1.0 million, respectively, and a corresponding indemnification receivable of $0.9 million and $1.0 million, respectively, related to the uncertain tax benefits and contractual indemnifications. As a result of the indemnifications, the Company does not anticipate any material effect to our operating results, liquidity or financial condition.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the section titled Selected Consolidated Financial Data\u201d and financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that\ncould cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nAquaVenture Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries (the Company\u201d, AquaVenture\u201d, we\u201d, us\u201d and our\u201d) is a multinational provider of Water-as-a-Service\u00ae, or WAAS\u00ae, solutions that provide our customers with a reliable and cost-effective source of clean drinking water, processed water and wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions primarily under long-term contracts that minimize capital investment by the customer. We believe our WAAS business model offers a differentiated value proposition that generates long-term customer relationships, recurring revenue, predictable cash flow and attractive rates of return. We generate revenue from our operations in North America, the Caribbean and South America and are pursuing expansion opportunities in North America, the Caribbean, South America, Africa, the Middle East and other select markets.\nWe deliver our WAAS solutions through two operating platforms: Seven Seas Water and Quench. Seven Seas Water is a multinational provider of desalination, wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions to governmental, municipal (including utility districts), industrial, property developer and hospitality customers. Our desalination solutions provide more than 8.5 billion gallons per year of potable, high purity industrial grade and ultra-pure water (which is water that is treated to meet higher purity standards required for industrial, semiconductor, utility or pharmaceutical applications). Our wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions, which include plants ranging in capacity from 5,000 gallons per day, or GPD, to more than 1.5 million GPD, are provided through 105 leases with customers as well as through the sale of equipment. Quench, is a U.S.-based provider of Point-of-Use, or POU, filtered water systems and related services through direct and indirect sales channels to approximately 60,000 institutional and commercial customers, including more than half of the Fortune 500, throughout the United States and Canada.\nOur Seven Seas Water platform generates recurring revenue through long-term contracts for our desalination and wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the significant majority of our Seven Seas Water revenue is derived from our desalination solutions in six different locations:\n \u00b7 The USVI: Seven Seas Water provides all of the municipal potable water needs for the islands of St. Croix, St. Thomas and St. John through its two seawater desalination plants, one on St. Croix and one on St. Thomas, having a combined capacity of approximately 7.0 million GPD. We also provide ultrapure water for use in power generation units by further processing a portion of the potable water we produce for certain of our customers. \n \u00b7 St. Maarten: Seven Seas Water is the primary supplier of municipal potable water needs for St. Maarten through its three seawater desalination plants, which have a combined capacity of approximately 5.8 million GPD. \n \u00b7 Cura\u00e7ao: Seven Seas Water provided industrial grade water through seawater and brackish water desalination facilities having a combined capacity of approximately 4.9 million GPD. \n \u00b7 Trinidad: Seven Seas Water provides potable water to southern Trinidad through its seawater desalination plant having a capacity of approximately 5.5 million GPD. Upon completion of an expansion during July 2016, total capacity was increased to 6.7 million GPD. \n \u00b7 The BVI: Seven Seas Water is the primary supplier of Tortola's potable water needs through its seawater desalination plant having a capacity of approximately 2.8 million GPD, which we began operating after we acquired the capital stock of Biwater (BVI) Holdings Limited on June 11, 2015. \n \u00b7 Peru: Seven Seas Water provides seawater and desalinated process water to a phosphate mine through a pipeline and seawater reverse osmosis facility having a capacity of approximately 2.7 million GPD, which we began operating after we completed the acquisition of all the outstanding shares of Aguas de Bayovar S.A.C. ( ADB\u201d) and all the rights and obligations under a design and construction contract for a desalination plant and related infrastructure located in Peru (the Peru Acquisition\u201d) on October 31, 2016. \nOn June 28, 2019, we received formal notice from Cura\u00e7ao Refinery Utilities B.V. ( CRU\u201d) that it is exercising its right to purchase our desalination facilities pursuant to the terms of the existing water supply agreement. The existing water supply agreement with CRU began in December 2008, with the Company providing water from a desalination plant with an initial design capacity of 0.5 million gallons per day under a five-year contract. This agreement has been amended several times, resulting in both expanded water production to the current design capacity of 4.9 million GPD and an extended contract expiration date of December 31, 2019. Pursuant to the terms of the water supply agreement, the applicable buy-out amount, upon consummation of the buyout right by CRU, was $3.5 million due upon the contract expiration date of December 31, 2019. On December 31, 2019, CRU consummated the execution of its buy-out right, and the Company received a cash payment of $3.5 million.\nThrough our Seven Seas Water wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions, we design, fabricate and install plants that are leased under a contractual term or sold to customers. The wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions offered to customers include scalable modular treatment plants, field-erected plants and temporary bypass plants ranging from 5,000 GPD to more than 1.5 million GPD. These solutions are provided through 105 leases with customers. With the November 1, 2018 AUC Acquisition, in which we acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of AUC pursuant to a membership interest purchase agreement, we significantly increased our wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions, which has contributed significantly to our Seven Seas Water revenues.\nWe are supported by operations centers in Tampa, Florida and Houston, Texas, which provides business development, engineering, field service support, procurement, accounting, finance and other administrative functions.\nOur Quench platform generates recurring revenue from the rental and servicing of POU water filtration systems and related equipment, such as ice and sparkling water machines, and from the contracted maintenance of customer owned equipment. Quench also generates revenue from the sale of coffee and consumables under agreements requiring customers to purchase a minimum amount monthly in exchange for the use of a coffee brewer. Our annual unit attrition rate at December 31, 2019 was less than 7.5%, implying an average rental period of more than 12 years. Through our direct sales channel, we receive recurring fees for the units we rent or service throughout the life of our customer relationship. In addition, we also receive non-recurring revenue from some customers for the sale of equipment and for certain services, such as the installation, relocation or removal of equipment. Through our indirect sales channel, we receive re-occurring revenue from the sale of equipment, parts and filters to dealers and retailers. We achieve an attractive return on our rental assets due to strong customer retention. We provide our systems and services to a broad mix of industries, including government, education, medical, manufacturing, retail, and hospitality, among others. We operate principally throughout the United States and Canada and are supported by a primary operations center in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania.\nFor the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, our consolidated revenue was $203.5 million and $145.6 million, respectively. The $57.9 million increase from 2018 to 2019 was primarily due to inclusion of incremental revenues from our acquisitions during 2018 and 2019 in addition to organic growth of existing operations. Including both organic and inorganic growth, our CAGR for revenue was 24.8% from 2014 to 2019.\nAgreement and Plan of Merger\nOn December 23, 2019, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or Merger Agreement, with Culligan International Company, or Culligan, a Delaware corporation, and Amberjack Merger Sub Limited, or Merger Sub, a business incorporated under the laws of the British Virgin Islands and wholly-owned subsidiary of Culligan. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions therein, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the Merger\u201d). As a result of the Merger, the Company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Culligan. The closing of the Merger remains subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the remaining conditions to the Merger set forth in the Merger Agreement. We expect the Merger to close no later than the end of the second quarter of 2020.\n2019 Acquisition Activities\nOn June 1, 2019, we acquired substantially all of the water filtration assets and assumed certain liabilities of Aguaman, Inc. ( Aguaman\u201d), a POU water filtration company based in Miami, Florida, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement. The aggregate purchase price, subject to adjustments, was $1.5 million, which included approximately $1.1 million of cash, $0.2 million payable on the one-year anniversary of the transaction and $0.2 million acquisition contingent\nconsideration payable to the seller on or before the one-year anniversary of the transaction. The assets acquired consist primarily of in-place lease agreements and the related POU systems in the United States.\nOn July 15, 2019, we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Carolina Pure Water Systems, LLC ( Carolina Pure\u201d), a POU water filtration company based in Raleigh, North Carolina, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement.

The assets acquired consist primarily of in-place lease agreements and the related POU systems in the United States.\nOn October 1, 2019, we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Mirex AquaPure Solutions L.P., d/b/a Mirex AquaPure Solutions ( Mirex\u201d), a POU water filtration company based in Houston, Texas, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement. The estimated aggregate purchase price, subject to adjustments, was $11.6 million, which included approximately $10.3 million of cash, $0.9 million payable on the one-year anniversary of the transaction, $0.3 million payable on the two-year anniversary of the transaction and approximately $0.1 million of acquisition contingent consideration. The assets acquired consist primarily of in-place lease agreements and the related POU systems in the United States.\nOn October 1, 2019, we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of 1920277 Alberta Inc., d/b/a Flowline Canada ( Flowline\u201d), a POU water filtration company based in Edmonton, Canada, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement. The estimated aggregate purchase price, subject to adjustments, was $0.9 million, which included approximately $0.8 million of cash and $0.1 million payable on the one-year anniversary of the transaction. The assets acquired consist primarily of in-place lease agreements and the related POU systems in Canada.\nOn December 2, 2019, we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Pure Planet Water, Inc. ( Pure Planet\u201d), a POU water filtration company based in Palm Desert, California, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement. The estimated aggregate purchase price, subject to adjustments, was $0.2 million, which included approximately $0.1 million of cash and $0.1 million payable on the one-year anniversary of the transaction. The assets acquired consist primarily of in-place lease agreements and the related POU systems in the United States.\nOn December 16, 2019, we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Jonli Water Services, Inc. ( Jonli\u201d), a POU water filtration company based in Quebec, Canada pursuant to an asset purchase agreement. The estimated aggregate purchase price, subject to adjustments, was $0.4 million, which was paid in cash. The assets acquired consist primarily of in-place maintenance agreements in Canada.\nWhile we routinely identify and evaluate potential acquisition candidates and engage in discussions and negotiations regarding potential acquisitions, there can be no assurance that any of our discussions or negotiations will result in an acquisition. If we enter into definitive agreements, there can be no assurances that all the conditions precedent to completing those acquisitions will be satisfied or waived, or that the acquisitions will be completed. Further, if we make any acquisitions, there can be no assurance that we will be able to operate or integrate any acquired businesses profitably or otherwise successfully implement our expansion strategy.\nOperating Segments\nWe have two reportable segments that align with our operating platforms, Seven Seas Water and Quench. The segment determination is supported by, among other factors, the existence of individuals responsible for the operations of each segment and who also report directly to our chief operating decision maker ( CODM\u201d), the nature of the segment's operations and information presented to our CODM. For the year ended December 31, 2019, revenues for the Seven Seas Water and Quench segments represented approximately 43% and 57%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues.\nIn addition to the Seven Seas Water and Quench segments, we record certain general and administrative costs that are not allocated to either of the reportable segments within Corporate and Other\u201d for the CODM and for segment reporting purposes. These costs include, but are not limited to, professional service fees and other expenses to support the activities of the registrant holding company. Corporate and Other does not include any labor allocations from the Seven Seas Water and Quench segments. We believe this presentation more accurately portrays the results of the core operations of each of the operating and reportable segments to the CODM. The Corporate and Other administration function is not treated as a segment.\nAs part of the segment reconciliation, intercompany interest expense and the associated intercompany interest income are included but are eliminated in consolidation.\nComponents of Revenues and Expenses\nManagement reviews the results of operations using a variety of measurements and procedures including an analysis of the statements of operations and comprehensive income which management considers an important aspect of our performance analysis. To help the reader better understand the discussion of operating results, details regarding certain line items have been provided below.\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the guidance regarding both revenue from contracts with customers and the determination of the customer in a service concession contract on a full retrospective basis (the Adopted Revenue Guidance\u201d). Several of the Company's contracts were impacted primarily due to the identification of multiple performance obligations within a single contract. However, the Adopted Revenue Guidance did not have a cash impact and, therefore, does not affect the economics of our underlying customer contracts. The adoption did, however, result in differences in the way our revenues, gross profit and net loss are determined compared to historical periods as presented within our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. More specifically, the Adopted Revenue Guidance impacted contracts with customers in our Seven Seas Water segment determined to be service concession arrangements and the classification of financing income. Contracts with customers within the Quench segment remained substantially unchanged.\nFor a discussion on our accounting policies as restated in accordance with the Adopted Revenue Guidance, please refer to Note 2- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenues\nSeven Seas Water\nOur Seven Seas Water business generates revenue from our desalination and wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions provided to governmental, municipal (including utility districts), industrial, property developer and hospitality customers. Revenues from our desalination solutions are primarily generated from contracts with customers to deliver treated bulk water, through both bulk water sales and service and service concession arrangements. Revenues from our wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions are primarily generated from capital and financed equipment sales, and leasing arrangements of up to five years.\nBulk water sales and service, which represent our desalination solutions, can include the delivery of bulk water or bulk water services, including the operations and maintenance of a customer-owned plant. We recognize revenues from the delivery of bulk water or the performance of bulk water services at the time the water or services are delivered to the customers in accordance with the contractual agreements. Certain agreements contain a minimum monthly charge provision which allows the Company to invoice the customer for the greater of the water supplied or a minimum monthly charge. The volume of water supplied is based on meter readings performed at or near the end of the month. Estimates of revenue for unbilled water are recorded when meter readings occur at a time other than the end of a period.\nCertain contracts with customers which require the construction of facilities to provide bulk water to a specific customer contain multiple obligations, including an implicit lease for the bulk water facilities and bulk water services, including operations and maintenance. The implicit lease obligation is generally accounted for as an operating lease as a result of the provisions of the contract. Revenues for contracts with both implicit lease and non-lease components are generally recognized ratably over the contract period as delivered to the customer after taking into consideration our analysis of contingent rent, any minimum take-or-pay provisions and contractual unit pricing.\nService concession arrangements are agreements entered into with a public-sector entity which controls both (i) the ability to modify or approve the services and prices provided by the operating company and (ii) beneficial entitlement to, or residual interest in, the infrastructure at the end of the term of the agreement. Service concession arrangements typically include the construction of infrastructure for the customer and an obligation to provide operations and maintenance on the infrastructure constructed.\nOur wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions generate recurring revenue from the rental of wastewater treatment and water reuse equipment. Our equipment is typically rented under multi-year term, automatically renewing contracts. We record the recurring fees received as revenue for the units we rent ratably throughout the term of each contract period.\nRevenues related to the construction of infrastructure, or product sales revenue, for both our desalination and wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions are recognized over time, using the input method based on cost incurred, which typically begins at the later of commencement of the construction or transfer of control, with revenue being fully recognized upon the completion of the infrastructure as control of the infrastructure is transferred to the customer. Timing differences between when the construction performance obligations are completed and when cash is received from the customer could result in a significant financing component. If a significant financing component is identified, the Company will recognize interest income, or financing revenues, on a long-term receivable established upon the completion of the construction of the infrastructure. Future cash flows received from the customer related to the long-term receivable are bifurcated between the principal repayment of the long-term receivable and the related financing revenue. Revenues related to the operations and maintenance are recognized as revenues as the services are provided to the customer.\nQuench\nOur Quench direct sales channel generates recurring revenue from the rental and servicing of POU water filtration systems and related equipment, such as ice and sparkling water machines, and from the contracted maintenance of customer-owned equipment. In addition, we also receive non-recurring revenue from some customers from the sale of equipment and for certain services, such as the installation, relocation or removal of equipment. Quench also generates revenue from the sale of coffee and consumables. Through our indirect sales channel, we receive re-occurring revenue from the sale of equipment, parts and filters to dealers and retailers.\nThe majority of Quench's direct sales channel customers rent our systems under multi-year, automatically renewing contracts. We record the recurring fees received as revenue for the units we rent ratably throughout the term of each contract period. Non-recurring revenues are recorded at the time services are performed or upon the customer taking control of the equipment and/or products sold.\nCost of Revenues\nSeven Seas Water\nCost of revenues for our Seven Seas Water business consists primarily of the cost of equipment depreciation; cost of equipment constructed for sale; and costs for operating and maintaining equipment on behalf of the customer. Expenditures in connection with the installation of our leased equipment are capitalized as contract fulfillment costs and depreciated to cost of revenues over the estimated useful life of the contract.\nEquipment depreciation is the largest component of our cost of revenues. In the future, we expect that our depreciation and cost of revenue will increase with the addition of new equipment and future acquisitions. Equipment depreciation is calculated using a straight-line method with an allowance for estimated residual values. Depreciation rates are determined based on the estimated useful lives of the assets. Depreciation commences when the equipment is placed into service.\nEquipment construction related to product sales revenue can include the cost of equipment and related installation services, including construction labor costs, field engineering costs, and third-party services. Such expenses can vary depending on the size of the desalination or wastewater plant or the complexity of the application, number of projects and the prevailing labor market for the level of employees needed in the jurisdiction where the plant is being constructed.\nOperating costs for operating and maintaining the equipment on behalf of the customer, which is primarily related to our desalination solutions, includes personnel costs (including compensation and other related personnel costs for employees), electric power, repairs and maintenance, personnel and travel costs for field engineering services and the cost of consumables. Labor costs are generally consistent within a normal range of plant production but can vary from\nplant to plant depending on the size of the plant and the complexity of the water application. Costs of labor can vary depending on the prevailing labor market for the level of employees needed in the jurisdiction where the plant is located.\nElectrical power for our large plants is generally provided by the customer or charged by us to the customer as a pass-through cost; however, our contracts normally require us to maintain electrical usage at or below a specified level of kilowatt hours for each gallon of water produced.\nExpenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred whereas betterments for property, plant and equipment owned by us that add capacity, significantly improve operating efficiency or extend the asset life are capitalized.\nField engineering services include mainly the cost of labor and travel for our specially trained and skilled employees who handle more complex maintenance tasks and to troubleshoot performance issues with our plant equipment and systems. Such expenses can vary depending on the number of projects and the time and extent of the maintenance requirements.\nConsumables are typically chemical additives used in the pre- and post-production processes to meet the water quality and attribute specifications of our customers.\nQuench\nCost of revenues for our Quench business consists primarily of the cost of personnel and travel for our field service, supply chain and technician scheduling and dispatch teams; depreciation of rental equipment and field service vehicles; the cost of equipment purchased or manufactured for resale; the cost of coffee and related consumables; the cost of filters and repair parts; and freight costs. Expenditures incurred in connection with the installation of our rental equipment are capitalized and depreciated to cost of revenues over their estimated useful life.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nEach segment reports the selling, general and administrative expenses that pertain to its business. General and administrative costs that are not allocated to either of the reportable segments are reported in Corporate and Other\u201d for the CODM and for segment reporting purposes. These costs include, but are not limited to, professional service fees and other expenses to support the activities of the registrant holding company. Corporate and Other does not include any labor allocations from the Seven Seas Water and Quench segments. We believe this presentation more accurately portrays the results of the core operations of each of the operating and reportable segments to the CODM. The Corporate and Other administration function is not treated as a segment.\nSeven Seas Water\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for Seven Seas Water consist primarily of compensation and benefits (including salaries, benefits and share-based compensation), third-party professional service fees and travel. Such expenses include personnel and travel costs of our business development organization, third party and internal engineering costs incurred in connection with new project feasibility studies or proposals, and costs for operating business development offices and activities. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include personnel and related costs for our executive, engineering, procurement, finance and human resources organizations and other administrative employees; third party professional service fees for consulting, legal, accounting and tax services; depreciation of office equipment and improvements and computer systems and software not directly related to specific revenue generating projects; amortization expense associated with intangible assets acquired in connection with business combinations, which are amortized over their expected useful lives; and other corporate expenses. In the future, we expect that our selling, general and administrative expenses will increase due to business development efforts in new markets and the general infrastructure to support our future growth.\nQuench\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for Quench include costs related to our selling and marketing functions as well as general and administrative costs associated with our operations center and operating locations, including information systems, finance, customer care, and human resources. Such costs include personnel costs\n(including salaries, benefits and share-based compensation), non-capitalized commissions, amortization of deferred lease costs, expenses related to lead generation, amortization expense associated with intangible assets acquired in connection with business combinations, which are amortized over their expected useful lives, fees for third-party professional services (including consulting, legal, accounting and tax services), travel, depreciation of non-service equipment and other administrative expenses.\nOther Expense and Income\nOther expense and income consists mainly of interest expense and interest income. Interest expense primarily relates to bank and private lender debt. In the future, we expect that our interest expense will increase as a result of the use of debt financing to support our organic and inorganic growth. Interest income primarily relates to interest received on certain cash and cash equivalent investments of three months or less.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Performance and Comparability of Results\nA number of key factors have affected and will continue to affect our performance and the comparison of our operating results, including matters discussed below and those items described in the section entitled Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSeven Seas Water\nThe financial performance of our Seven Seas Water business has been, and will continue to be, significantly affected by our ability to identify and consummate acquisitions of, or to identify and secure new projects for, desalination, wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions with new and existing governmental, municipal, industrial, property developer and hospitality customers. Our performance and the comparability of results over time are largely driven by the timing of events such as acquisitions of existing plants, securing new plant projects (including bulk water sales and service), rental agreements and product sales, plant expansions, and the extension, termination or expiration of water supply agreements and rental agreements for wastewater treatment and water reuse equipment. The timing of many of these events is unpredictable. New plant projects, plant expansions and plant acquisitions, when they do occur, may require significant levels of cash and company resources before and after the commencement of revenue and their impact on our results of operations can be significant.\nThe table below summarizes significant events in 2019 and 2018 that affect the performance and comparability of financial results for these and future periods:\n\n (1) Effective April 1, 2018, we entered into an amendment to the water purchase agreement in St. Maarten. The amendment reduced the required minimum monthly water purchase by our customer, in exchange for a four-year extension to the water contract. The reduction in the required minimum monthly water purchase will remain in effect for three years, after which time the average monthly minimum purchase will then revert to previous minimum requirements for the remainder of the contract. Our customer has the option to extend the lower minimum volumes for an additional two years, which, if exercised, would also extend the contract expiry from 2025 to 2027. \n (2) Effective November 1, 2019, we terminated our original agreement in St. Croix and subsequently entered new agreement with the customer. Under the new agreement, which expires in 2024, we expanded the design capacity of the plant by 1.0 million GPD. \n (3) On December 31, 2019, our water supply agreement in Cura\u00e7ao expired and our customer, CRU, exercised its right to purchase the desalination facilities pursuant to the terms of the existing water supply agreement. The applicable buy-out amount, upon consummation of the buyout right, is $3.5 million due upon the contract expiration date. On December 31, 2019, CRU consummated the execution of its buy-out right and the Company received a cash payment of $3.5 million. This payment was recorded as a gain on sale of property, plant and equipment, which is reflected within SG&A in our Seven Seas Water segment. \nIn addition to the table above, we also acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of AUC on November 1, 2018. The acquired wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions, which include plants ranging in capacity from 5,000 GPD to more than 1.5 million GPD, are provided through 105 leases with customers.\nTime and Expense Associated with New Business Development\nThe period of time required to develop an opportunity and secure an award can be lengthy, historically taking multiple years during which significant amounts of business development expense may be incurred. Our business development organization seeks to identify new project opportunities for both competitive bid situations and through unsolicited negotiated arrangements. Governmental water customers generally require a competitive bid for new plant development. Participation in a formal bid process and in negotiated arrangements can require significant costs, the timing of which can impact the comparability of our financial results. While our proposed pricing factors in such costs, there is no assurance that we will secure the contract and ultimately recover our costs.\nThe period from contract award to the commissioning of a new plant (and commencement of revenues) can also vary greatly due to, among other things, the size and complexity of the plant. In the case of a newly constructed desalination plant, there is typically a ramp-up period during which the plant operates below normal capacity.\nExisting Customer Relationships\nWe expect to continue to grow our business with existing customers by expanding and extending the contractual term for existing plants to meet an expected increase in customer demand, each of which will impact our performance and comparability of results. As customer demand increases for either the volume of water produced and delivered or the wastewater treated, we typically experience increased sales volume through the use of additional capacity built into existing desalination plants or through the renegotiation of an existing contract and deployment of\nincremental equipment to meet customer demands. Similarly, contract extensions and renewals provide economic benefits for both the customer and us. By the time we enter into an extension or renewal we have typically recovered meaningful portions of our capital investment and only incremental capital investment may be required. These factors provide a competitive advantage in a contract extension (or renewal) process and may enable us to reduce unit prices, sustain profitability and achieve an improved and continuing return on our invested capital.\nAcquisition of Existing Assets or Business\nRevenue and expenses will increase upon an acquisition of existing assets or businesses from a third party. In addition, the time, cost and capital required to complete an acquisition are significant. Specifically, the costs incurred prior to the acquisition can include professional fees, travel costs and, in certain instances, success fees paid to third parties. These costs may be incurred well in advance of the completion of an acquisition. Upon completion of the acquisition, certain assets, including desalination plants, may experience periods of downtime or reduced production levels as well as additional capital investment while we bring the plant up to our engineering and operating standards. Acquisitions are a part of our Seven Seas Water growth strategy and accordingly our ability to grow could be impacted by our effectiveness in completing and integrating our acquisitions.\nEntry into New Markets\nOur future performance will be affected by our investment and success in securing business in new markets. While continuing to penetrate the Caribbean market, we have also expanded our business development efforts to pursue a global business footprint in North America, South America, Africa, the Middle East and other select markets. As we continue to pursue entry into new markets, we may incur increasing expenses for business development that may be sustained for long periods of time before realizing the benefit of incremental revenues. In addition, our entry into some new markets may be better served through partnering arrangements such as joint ventures, which may result in a minority position. Such an arrangement may be economically attractive even though, in some circumstances, we may not be able to consolidate the operating results of a partnering arrangement with our own operating results.\nChanges to Sales Volume, Costs of Sales and Operating Expenses\nFor our desalination solutions, our profitability is affected by changes in the volume of water delivered above any minimum required customer purchases, our ability to control plant production costs, and our ability to control equipment manufacturing costs and operating expenses. For our wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions, our profitability is affected by the number and profitability of construction projects commenced and completed during the period and the number of new leases entered into with customers.\nDue to the capital-intensive nature of our desalination solutions and the relatively high level of fixed costs such as depreciation and contract cost amortization, our Seven Seas Water business model is characterized by high levels of operating leverage. As a result, significant swings in bulk water production volume could favorably or unfavorably impact profitability more significantly than business models with less operating leverage. We have mitigated the downside risk of declines in bulk water plant production through the inclusion of minimum customer purchase requirements in a majority of our eight water supply contracts with our major customers. In the other two water supply contracts, we have contractual rights to be the exclusive water supplier or our customer must purchase all the water we produce and we must provide volume at a specified percentage of installed capacity. We design our plants to meet or exceed contractual supply requirements but our failure to meet minimum supply requirements could result in penalties that may adversely affect our financial performance.\nOperating costs for our desalination solutions can have a significant impact on the profitability of our operations. Electrical costs are a major expense in connection with the operation of a water treatment plant. Our major customers either, directly or through related parties, provide the electricity needed to run the plant without cost to us or reimburse us for this cost on a pass-through basis. In general, our contracts require us to maintain electrical usage at or below a specified level of kilowatt hours for each gallon of water produced. As a result, our cost risk is principally with respect to our ability to use electrical power efficiently. We have made investments in plant equipment and configuration to maintain required levels of electrical efficiency.\nPersonnel costs are another major cost element for plant operations. Our contracts provide for price adjustments based on inflation. Profitability, however, could be adversely affected by significant increases in market prices for labor, social taxes and benefits or changes in operations requiring additional personnel.\nRepairs and maintenance can be a significant cost of the business. Because we assume the responsibility to operate and maintain our desalination plants over a long period of time, we use plant designs and equipment that seek to minimize repairs and maintenance and optimize long-term performance. We may however, from time to time experience equipment failures outside of warranty coverage which could result in significant costs to repair.\nOur operations centers in Tampa, Florida and Houston, Texas incur significant selling, general and administrative expenses that are intended to support our plans for future growth. Certain of these expenses, in particular those related to business development, are largely discretionary and not correlated specifically to short-term changes in revenue. Direct engineering cost, including allocated overhead, for personnel at our operations centers are capitalized as a project cost based on hours incurred on active plant construction projects which can change from period to period. The timing of new hires, the utilization of engineering personnel and the spending in these areas may affect the comparability of our results.\nContractually Scheduled and Negotiated Changes to Terms and Conditions\nOur Seven Seas Water business is conducted in accordance with the terms of long-term water supply contracts that, among other things, may provide for minimum customer purchases, guaranteed supply volumes and specified levels of pricing based on the volume of water purchased during the billing period. These contractual features are key determinants of plant revenue and plant profitability. Certain of our contracts provide for contractually scheduled price changes. In addition, our contracts may include provisions to increase prices in accordance with a specified inflation index such as the consumer price index. From time to time, we may also negotiate pricing changes with our customers as part of an arrangement to, among other things, extend or renew a contract or increase capacity by expanding the plant.\nRevenues and operating income can be expected to decrease, potentially by a significant amount, upon a decrease in contracted services or contract renegotiation, termination or expiration.\nCustomer Demand and Certain Other External Factors\nFor our desalination solutions, we design plant capacity to exceed the minimum purchase requirements contained in our contracts to meet anticipated customer needs and maintain sufficient excess capacity. Our customer's water demand and our ability to meet that demand can vary among quarters and annual periods for a variety of reasons over which we have little control, including:\n \u00b7 the timing and length of shutdowns of customer facilities or infrastructure due to factors such as equipment failures, power outages, regular scheduled maintenance and severe weather which can adversely affect customer demand; \n \u00b7 seasonal fluctuations or downturns in the general economy can be expected to adversely affect demand from customers for whom tourism is a significant economic driver, including our municipal or resort customers; \n \u00b7 economic cycles may affect the industrial customers we serve, especially those in the energy and mining sectors where volatility in commodity prices or consolidation of capacity could adversely affect customer demand; \n \u00b7 excessive periods of rain or drought can impact primary demand; \n \u00b7 destruction caused by floods, tropical storms and hurricanes which can impact primary demand as well as cause delays in collections from our customers; \n \u00b7 the non-renewal of contracts by customers; \n \u00b7 various environmental factors and natural or man-made conditions impacting the quality of source water, such as bacteria levels or contaminants in source water, can require additional pretreatment thus adding cost and reducing the level of production throughput; and \n \u00b7 technological advances especially in new filtration technologies, reverse osmosis membranes, energy recovery equipment and energy efficient plant designs may affect future operating performance and the cost competitiveness of our services in the market. \nFor our wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions, we utilize a modular design that enables us to expand capacity with increasing customer demand. The plants are designed to treat peak volumes of wastewater produced by our customers. Our customer's demand for our wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions can vary among quarters and annual periods for a variety of reasons over which we have little control, including:\n \u00b7 individual developers or customers inability to procure funding to initiate building or expanding certain residential developments; \n \u00b7 residential development specific construction delays such as weather-related delays, changes in specifications or inability of ancillary contractors to preform works; \n \u00b7 downturns in the general economy and housing market that can decrease demand for new housing developments thus limiting increases in demand for wastewater treatment; \n \u00b7 replacement of our solutions by a larger, centralized facility or the connecting of customers to a centralized wastewater treatment or water reuse solution; and \n \u00b7 potential changes in the regulatory environment that could impede development of further decentralized wastewater treatment systems. \nQuench\nAttracting New Customers\nOur performance will be affected by our ability to continue to attract new customers. We believe that the U.S. commercial water cooler market is underpenetrated by POU water filtration, which represented only 11.1% by revenue of a $4.2 billion per year market in 2015. We intend to continue to invest in selling and marketing efforts to attract new customers for our filtered water systems, both within our existing geographic territories and in targeted additional territories in the United States and internationally. Our ability to attract new customers may vary from period to period for several reasons, including the effectiveness of our selling and marketing efforts, our ability to hire and retain salespeople, competitive dynamics, variability in our sales cycle (particularly related to opportunities to serve larger enterprises), the timing of the roll-out of large-enterprise orders and general economic conditions.\nCustomer Relationships\nWe believe that our existing customers continue to provide significant opportunities for us to offer additional products and services. In our direct sales channel, these opportunities include the rental of additional or upgraded water coolers, as well as the rental of equipment from our newer product lines enabled by POU water filtration, such as ice machines, sparkling water coolers and coffee brewers. In addition, we expect to invest to grow the sales of consumables associated with our systems, such as coffee and related consumables, and continue to pursue the resale of equipment to dealers, retailers and end customers who prefer to own, rather than lease, their equipment.\nTypically, we rent our systems to customers on multi-year, automatically-renewing contracts, and we anticipate extending our relationships with existing customers beyond the initial contract term. Some customers terminate their agreements during the agreement term, typically due to financial constraints, and others cancel at the end of the term. Our annual unit attrition rate at December 31, 2019 was less than 7.5%, implying an average rental period of more than 12 years. Our ability to retain our existing customer relationships will affect our performance and is affected by a number of factors, including the effectiveness of our retention efforts, the quality of our products and service, our pricing, competitive dynamics in the industry, product availability, and the health of the economy. In addition, the non-\nrecurring revenue from the sale of equipment, coffee and consumables, is less predictable and can change based on fluctuations in demand in a specific period.\nStrategic Acquisitions\nThe POU water filtration industry is highly fragmented, with a large number of local competitors and several larger regional operators. Quench has completed 20 acquisitions since our initial public offering, of which 8 have occurred since the beginning of 2019. We believe our recent acquisition activity is indicative of the opportunity for future inorganic growth.\nThrough our indirect sales channel, we offer POU systems to networks of approximately 260 dealers and retailers predominantly in North America. The indirect sales channel expands our participation in the growing POU market domestically and internationally. In addition, the channel enhances our ability to develop, source and manufacture innovative, exclusive coolers and purification offerings. Lastly, the channel offers us the opportunity to develop deeper relationships with POU dealers that could lead to future acquisitions.\nWe expect to continue to pursue select acquisitions to increase our scale, customer density and geographic service area, as well as to increase our participation in the broader international market for POU systems. Our ability to complete acquisitions is a function of many factors, including competition, purchase price and our short-term business priorities. Accordingly, it is impossible to predict whether any current or future discussions will lead to the successful completion of any acquisitions. Since acquisitions are a part of our growth strategy, the inability to complete, integrate and profitably operate acquisitions may adversely affect our operating results.\nChanges to Cost of Sales and Operating Expenses\nProfitability of our Quench platform will be affected by our ability to control our costs of sales and operating expenses.\nA majority of Quench rental agreements are priced at fixed rates for multi-year periods ranging up to four years. As a result, our gross margins are exposed to potential cost of sales increases that cannot be immediately offset by price adjustments. The volume, mix and pricing of equipment and consumables purchased for immediate resale (as opposed to rental) can impact the consistency and comparability of our results. The overall compensation of field service and supply chain support (along with the costs of associated vehicles), may affect our gross margins.\nQuench incurs selling, general and administrative costs to support a North American sales force, a widely dispersed installed base of customers, and a high volume of recurring business transactions. A portion of such costs is composed of new customer acquisition costs, such as lead generation expenses, which are expensed upfront and recovered over the periods following the execution of a customer contract and any subsequent renewal. Commissions and other costs that are directly related to the negotiation and execution of leases, considered contract acquisition costs, are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the contract period. Selling, general and administrative costs also include certain costs to complete business acquisitions, which precede the realization of revenues generated by the acquired new business, and discretionary investments in infrastructure to support our plans for Quench's future long-term growth. The timing of these expenditures and their impact relative to the revenues generated can affect our performance and comparability of results.\nCorporate and Other\nChanges to Operating Expenses\nWe expect to incur increased legal, accounting and other expenses as we pursue our expansion strategy and as a public company, including costs resulting from public company reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act\u201d), and the listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange. We anticipate that such operating costs as a percentage of revenue will moderate over the long-term if and as our revenues increase or as a result of certain other corporate activities or projects.\nPresentation of Financial Information\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). In the preparation of these consolidated financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses and related disclosures. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or operating results would be affected. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates, which we discuss below.\nAdoption of New Accounting Pronouncements\nUnder the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act, we meet the definition of an emerging growth company.\u201d We have irrevocably elected to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance regarding implementation of measurement of credit losses on financial instruments. This guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those annual periods, and early adoption is permitted. We adopted this guidance on a modified retrospective basis on January 1, 2019 with the cumulative effect of transition as of the effective date of adoption. For a discussion on the impacts of the authoritative guidance on our financial statements, please refer to Note 2- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn March 2019, the FASB issued authoritative guidance regarding targeted changes to lessor accounting. This guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those annual periods, and early adoption is permitted. We adopted this guidance on a retrospective basis as of January 1, 2019 (the original adoption date of the lease pronouncement). For a discussion on the impacts of the authoritative guidance on our financial statements, please refer to Note 2- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued authoritative guidance regarding leases that requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and right of use asset for operating leases, with the exception of short-term leases. In addition, lessor accounting was modified to align, where necessary, with lessee accounting modifications and the authoritative guidance regarding revenue from contracts with customers. During 2018, the FASB issued additional authoritative guidance which, among other things, provided an option to apply transition provisions under the standard at adoption date rather than the earliest comparative period presented as well as added a practical expedient that would permit lessors to not separate non-lease components from the associated lease components if certain conditions are met. These amendments are effective, in conjunction with the new lease standard, for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those annual periods.\nWe adopted this guidance on a modified retrospective basis on January 1, 2019 with the cumulative effect of transition as of the effective date of adoption. For a discussion on the impacts of the authoritative guidance on our financial statements, please refer to Note 2- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements to be Adopted\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued authoritative guidance regarding implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract. This guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those annual periods, and early adoption is permitted. We adopted this guidance on January 1, 2020 on a prospective basis. Although certain implementation costs we incur going forward may now be capitalizable, there is no material impact expected to the consolidated financial statements as a result of this adoption.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued authoritative guidance regarding fair value measurements. This guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those annual periods, and early adoption is permitted. We adopted this guidance on January 1, 2020 on a prospective basis. Beginning with all periods subsequent to the adoption date, we will prepare the enhanced disclosures within the consolidated financial statements as a result of this adoption.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments used. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. In making estimates and judgments, management employs critical accounting policies.\nOur significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.\nLeases\nLessee accounting\nWe lease space and operating assets, including offices, office equipment, warehouses, storage yards and storage units under non-cancelable operating leases. We account for these leases in accordance with the authoritative guidance adopted as of January 1, 2019. Please see Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements\u201d section above for information regarding this adoption.\nAt contract inception, we determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease. If the arrangement contains a lease, we recognize a right-of-use asset and an operating lease liability at the lease commencement date. Lease expense for lease payments made is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nThe operating lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments at the lease commencement date. The current portion of our operating lease liabilities are recorded within accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which is comprised of the initial amount of the operating lease liability adjusted for lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred less any lease incentives received. The right-of-use asset is subsequently measured throughout the lease term at the carrying amount of the operating lease liability, plus initial direct costs, plus (minus) any prepaid (accrued) lease payments, less the unamortized balance of lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets are periodically reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances arise.\nKey estimates and judgments in determining both the operating lease liability and right-of-use asset include the determination of (i) the discount rate it uses to discount the unpaid lease payments to present value, (ii) the lease term and (iii) the lease payments.\nThe discount rate applied to the unpaid lease payments is the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, our incremental borrowing rate. Generally, we cannot determine the interest rate implicit in the lease because we do not have access to the lessor's estimated residual value or the amount of the lessor's deferred initial direct costs. Therefore, we generally derive an incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate for the lease. Our incremental borrowing rate for a lease is the rate of interest we would have to pay on a collateralized basis to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments under similar terms.\nThe lease term for all of our leases includes the noncancelable period of the lease, plus any additional periods covered by either our option to extend (or not to terminate) the lease that we are reasonably certain to exercise, and/or an option to extend (or not to terminate) the lease controlled by the lessor.\nLease payments included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities are comprised of the following:\n \u00b7 fixed payments; \n \u00b7 variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate, initially measured using the index or rate at the lease commencement date; and \n \u00b7 the exercise price of our option to purchase the underlying asset if we are reasonably certain to exercise the option. \nIn certain instances, our leases include non-lease components, such as equipment maintenance or common area maintenance. As part of its adoption of authoritative guidance on leases on January 1, 2019, we have not elected the practical expedient to account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component and have elected (for all classes of underlying assets) to account for these components separately. We have allocated the consideration in the contract to the lease and non-lease components based on each component's relative standalone price. We determine standalone prices for the lease components based on the prices for which other lessors lease similar assets on a standalone basis. We determine standalone prices for the non-lease components based on the prices that suppliers might charge for those type of services on a standalone basis. If observable standalone prices are not readily available, we estimate the standalone prices maximizing the use of observable information.\nWe have elected to utilize the short-term lease exemption and not recognize a right-of-use asset and corresponding operating lease liability for leases with expected terms of 12 months or less. We recognize the lease payments associated with its short-term leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nLessor accounting\nWe generate revenues through the lease of our bulk water facilities, wastewater treatment and water reuse equipment, and filtered water and related systems equipment to customers. In certain instances, we enter into a contract with a customer but must construct the underlying asset, including bulk water facilities and wastewater treatment and water reuse equipment, prior to its lease.\nAt the time of contract inception, we determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease.\nCustomer contracts that contain leases, which can be explicit or implicit in the contract, are generally classified as either operating leases or sales-type leases and can contain both lease and non-lease components, including operating and maintenance services ( O&M\u201d) of the Company-owned equipment. As part of our adoption of authoritative guidance on leases on January 1, 2019, we elected the practical expedient for all classes of underlying assets to not separate the lease and non-lease components if certain conditions are met, including the classification of the lease component as operating and the revenue recognition pattern of both the lease and non-lease components. We will account for the contract with the customer as a combined component under the respective authoritative guidance for the predominant element in the contract, the lease or non-lease component.\nFor leases classified as sales-type leases, we allocate the transaction price based on the relative standalone selling prices of the identified performance obligations.\nIf the customer contract contains or is accounted for as a lease, the key estimates and judgments used in accounting for the lease as a lessor include the following: (i) lease term, (ii) the economic life of the underlying leased\nasset, (iii) determination of lease payments and (iv) determination of the fair value at the time of contract inception and the residual value of the underlying leased asset.\nThe lease term for all of our leases includes the noncancelable period of the lease, plus any additional periods covered by either a lessee option to extend (or not to terminate) the lease that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise, and/or an option to extend (or not to terminate) the lease controlled by us. Contracts entered into with customers can include either the option to renew or an auto-renewing provision that results in the automatic extension of the existing contract. In certain instances, key provisions such as the lease payment and term of the renewal are not stated and are subject to renewal.\nThe economic life of the underlying leased asset is determined to be either the period over which the asset is expected to be economically usable, or where the benefits it can produce exceed the cost to replace or undertake major repairs. In certain instances, the economic life of the underlying leased asset can exceed the useful life we assign.\nLease payments that are accounted for as rental revenue are comprised of the following:\n \u00b7 fixed payments; \n \u00b7 variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate, initially measured using the index or rate at the lease commencement date; \n \u00b7 the exercise price of a lessee option to purchase the underlying asset if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise the option; and \n \u00b7 payments for penalties for the termination of a lease if the term reflects the lessee terminating the lease. \nOur leases do not typically include a requirement for the customer to guarantee the residual value of the underlying leased asset. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or rate are excluded from the determination of lease payments.\nThe fair value of the underlying leased asset at contract inception and residual value of underlying leased asset at the end of the term of the lease are determined based on the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction at the time of valuation. Our risk management strategy for protecting the residual value of the underlying assets include our ongoing maintenance during the lease term as well as clauses and other protections within the lease agreements which require the lessee to return the underlying asset in working condition at the end of the lease term.\nAt contract inception, we determine the lease classification of the underlying asset. We consider inputs such as the lease term, lease payments, fair value of the underlying asset and residual value of the underlying asset when assessing the classification. The discount rate applied to the unpaid lease payments is the interest rate implicit in the lease. The rate implicit in the lease is the rate of interest that, at a given date, causes the aggregate present value of (a) the lease payments and (b) the amount that the we expect to derive from the underlying asset following the end of the lease term to equal the sum of (1) the fair value of the underlying asset minus any related investment tax credit retained and expected to be realized and (2) any deferred initial direct costs we incur.\nIn certain instances, contracts with customers may also include the option for the customer to purchase the underlying asset at the end of the lease term. When applicable and certain conditions are met, we will incorporate the stated purchase price into the determination of the interest rate implied in the lease.\nRecoverable Amount of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill associated with our business combinations has been and is expected to continue increasing in the future as further acquisitions are completed. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter and more frequently if a change in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicates that potential impairment exists. We first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If it is determined to be more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we perform the quantitative analysis of the goodwill impairment test. Otherwise, the quantitative test is optional.\nUnder the quantitative analysis, the recoverability of goodwill is measured at each reporting unit by comparing the reporting unit's carrying amount, including goodwill, to the fair market value of the reporting unit. We determine the fair market value of our reporting units based on a weighting of the present value of projected future cash flows, which we refer to as the Income Approach, and a comparative market approach under both the guideline company method and guideline transaction method, which we refer to as the Market Approach. Fair market value using the Income Approach is based on our estimated future cash flows on a discounted basis. The Market Approach compares each of our reporting units to other comparable companies based on valuation multiples derived from operational and transactional data to arrive at a fair value. Factors requiring significant judgment include, among others, the determination of comparable companies, assumptions related to forecasted operating results, discount rates, long-term growth rates, and market multiples. Changes in economic or operating conditions, or changes in our business strategies, that occur after the annual impairment analysis and which impact these assumptions, may result in a future goodwill impairment charge, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements.\nIn determining its reporting units, the Company reviews its operating segments to determine the number of components within each segment. If an operating segment contains only a single component, the operating segment is deemed a reporting unit. If an operating segment contains more than one component, the Company aggregates into a single reporting unit those components determined to have similar economic characteristics. Components determined to have dissimilar economic characteristics are considered a separate reporting unit. As of both December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Quench segment was determined to be composed of a single reporting unit. As of both December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Seven Seas Water segment was determined to be composed of two reporting units.\nFor the 2019 and 2018 goodwill impairment assessments, we performed a qualitative assessment of each reporting unit that existed at the time of the impairment assessment. Based upon the qualitative assessments, it was determined that there was substantial evidence that it was more likely than not that the fair value for each reporting unit were more than the carrying values. As such, no quantitative assessment was deemed necessary.\nOther intangible assets consist of certain trade names, customer relationships and non-compete agreements. Intangible assets which have a finite life are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis. Customer relationships which have a finite life are amortized on an accelerated basis based on the projected economic value of the asset over its useful life. Intangible assets with a finite life are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which consist of certain trade names, are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the asset may be impaired. No impairment was recorded during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nBusiness Combinations\nIn accordance with accounting for business combinations, we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill.\nOur purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. Management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices, the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses. Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates.\nThe valuation of net assets acquired in a business combination determines the allocation of purchase price to specific assets and the subsequent recognition of expense. A change in our estimate of the value assigned to intangibles or a change in our estimate of useful life for the intangibles could impact the amount of amortization expense recorded in any period. A 10% change in the amortization expense recorded for the year ended December 31, 2019 would have impacted our pre-tax net loss by approximately $2.3 million.\nIf an acquisition does not meet the definition of a business combination, then we account for the transaction as an asset acquisition. In an asset acquisition, goodwill is not recognized, but rather any excess consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired is allocated on a relative fair value basis to the identifiable net assets. In addition, transaction-related expenses are capitalized and allocated to the net assets acquired on a relative fair value basis.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe account for share-based compensation by measuring the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value. The cost is recognized over the requisite service period, net of adjustments for forfeitures as they occur.\nWe have several equity award plans, including plans which were established prior to the corporate reorganization and IPO and one which became effective upon the effectiveness of the IPO. See Note 12- Share-based Compensation\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a complete discussion on all our equity award plans.\nWe expense the fair value of share-based compensation awards over the requisite service period, which is typically the vesting period. The expense is then adjusted for forfeitures as they occur. We estimate the grant date fair value of options and other equity awards with hurdle rates using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model that requires management to apply judgment and make estimates, including:\n \u00b7 expected volatility, which is calculated based on reported volatility data for a representative group of publicly traded companies for which historical information is available. Because we only recently completed our IPO, we have continued to use an average of expected volatility based on the volatilities of a representative group of publicly traded companies for a period approximating the expected term of the grant; \n \u00b7 the risk-free interest rate, which is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect on the date of grant commensurate with the expected term assumption; \n \u00b7 expected term, which we calculate using the simplified method, as we have insufficient historical information regarding our equity awards to provide a basis for an estimate; \n \u00b7 fair value of the underlying securities, which is determined using the option-pricing model or by reasonably contemporaneous arm's length transactions prior to our IPO and closing prices as reported by the New York Stock Exchange on or after the IPO; and \n \u00b7 dividend yield, which is zero based on the fact that we never paid cash dividends and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. \nPrior to our IPO, there were significant judgments and estimates inherent in the determination of the fair value of our shares. These judgments and estimates included assumptions regarding our future operating performance, the time to completing an initial public offering, or other liquidity event, the related company valuations associated with such events, and the determinations of the appropriate valuation methods. If we had made different assumptions, our share-based compensation expense and net loss could have been significantly different. A 10% change in share-based compensation expense recorded for the year ended December 31, 2019 would have impacted our pre-tax net loss by approximately $0.5 million.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach to the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. We are required to exercise judgment with respect to the realization of our net deferred tax assets. Management evaluates all positive and negative evidence and exercises judgment regarding past and future events to determine if it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets may not be realized. If appropriate, a valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that\nmay not be realized. We evaluate tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in our tax returns, and we record a liability for uncertain tax positions. We use a two-step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions. First, tax positions are recognized if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. Second, tax positions are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nAquaVenture Holdings Limited is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, which does not impose income taxes. Certain of our subsidiaries file separate tax returns and are subject to federal income taxes at the corporate level in the United States or in foreign jurisdictions. Certain other subsidiaries operate in jurisdictions that do not impose taxes based on income.\nVarious internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable, material or immaterial effects on our effective income tax rate and therefore, impact net income and earnings per share. These factors include, but are not limited to changes in tax rates; changes in tax laws, regulations and rulings; changes in interpretations of existing laws, regulations and rulings; changes in the evaluation of our ability to realize deferred tax assets, and changes in accounting principles; changes in current pre-tax income as well as changes in forecasted pre-tax income; changes in the mix of earnings among countries with different tax rates; and acquisitions and changes in our corporate structure. These factors may result in periodic revisions to our effective income tax rate, which could affect our cash flow and results of operations. We recorded a valuation allowance of $28.5 million as of December 31, 2019 related primarily to net operating losses.\nA 0.50% change in our effective income tax rate would have impacted our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2019 by approximately $0.1 million.\nResults of Operations\nWe have omitted discussion of the earliest of the three years covered by our consolidated financial statements presented in this report because that disclosure was already included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, as amended. You are encouraged to reference Part II, Item 7, within that report, as amended, for a discussion of our financial condition and result of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe operating expenses of the parent, AquaVenture Holdings Limited, are reported separately from the two operating and reportable segments below. See Operating Segments\u201d located in the Overview\u201d section above for more information.\nThe following table sets forth the components of our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for each of the periods presented.\n\nThe following table sets forth the components of our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for each of the periods presented as a percentage of revenue.\n\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nRevenues\nThe following table presents revenue for each of our two operating segments:\n\nOur total revenues of $203.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $57.9 million, or 39.7%, from $145.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 through a combination of organic and inorganic growth. In calculating organic and inorganic revenue growth, (i) organic growth represents estimated revenue from operations that existed in both the current and comparable periods, and (ii) inorganic growth includes the estimated revenue from acquisitions for the 12 months following an acquisition and any revenue contributions from divested businesses for the months in the prior year period in which the business did not exist in the current year period.\nSeven Seas Water revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $21.9 million, or 33.0%, compared to the same period of 2018, which were comprised of 31.2% inorganic growth and 1.8% organic growth. Bulk water revenues increased $3.2 million, or 5.6%, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to: (i) increases of $1.4 million from our USVI operations and $0.7 million from our St. Maarten operations due to higher production volumes compared to the same period of 2018; (ii) an increase of $1.3 million in connection with the commencement of our water contract in Anguilla; and (iii) an increase of $0.4 million in our BVI operations driven by increases in the water rate compared to the prior year. This was partially offset by $0.3 million lower revenue in our Peru operations primarily due to revenue received in the prior year in connection with non-routine services performed for the customer. Rental revenues and product sales increased $12.5 million and $6.6 million, respectively, primarily due to the inclusion of the AUC operations which were acquired in November 2018.\nQuench revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $36.0 million, or 45.4%, compared to the same period of 2018, which were comprised of 31.8% of inorganic growth and 13.6% organic growth. The prior year period included $3.5 million of revenue from the Atlas High Purity Solutions business that was divested in October 2018. Rental revenues increased $17.6 million, or 28.4%, compared to the prior year period, which was comprised of 20.5% inorganic net growth from acquisitions and 7.9% of organic growth due to additional units placed under new leases in excess of unit attrition. Product sales increased $18.4 million compared to the prior year, which included $12.8 million of inorganic net growth primarily due to the acquisitions of PHSI and Bluline in December 2018, and $5.6 million of organic growth driven by higher indirect dealer equipment sales and coffee sales.\nGross margin\nThe following table presents the major components of cost of revenues, gross profit and gross margin for our two operating segments:\n\nTotal gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased 210 basis points to 51.1% from 53.2% in the prior year period.\nSeven Seas Water gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased 170 basis points to 54.0% compared to 55.7% in the prior year. Bulk water gross margin of 54.2% increased 50 basis points compared to 53.7% in the prior year primarily due to higher revenues in our BVI and USVI operations without a commensurate increase in costs. This was partially offset by a decrease in gross margin at our Trinidad operations due to a depreciation expense adjustment in the prior year in connection with a purchase price refund received on in-service equipment. Rental gross margin of 67.0% decreased from 74.7% in the prior year primarily due to additional depreciation expense on property, plant and equipment related to the finalization of purchase accounting for the AUC acquisition. Product sales gross margin of 15.0% decreased from 17.5% in the prior year period primarily due to higher contributions from lower-margin contracts compared to the prior year.\nQuench gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased 240 basis points to 48.8% from 51.2% for the same period of 2018. Rental gross margin of 52.7% decreased from 55.7% in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenue related to additional units placed on lease, partially offset by lower compensation and benefits as a percentage of revenues due to continued leveraging of the platform. Product sales gross margin increased to 40.2% for the year ended December 31, 2019 from 35.0% in the prior year, primarily driven by the higher-margin indirect PHSI dealer equipment sales.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nThe following table presents selling, general and administrative, or SG&A, expenses for our operating segments:\n\nTotal SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $12.3 million, or 14.8%, compared to the same period of 2018.\nSeven Seas Water SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $5.2 million to $25.0 million compared to the prior year, which was primarily due to (i) a decrease of $4.4 million in share-based compensation expense driven by the completion of the vesting of certain equity grants made in connection with our initial public offering in 2016, (ii) a $3.0 million net gain on sale of property, plant and equipment primarily in connection with our customer in Cura\u00e7ao exercising its right to purchase the desalination facilities pursuant to the water supply agreement, and (iii) $1.6 million of lower professional fees primarily due to elevated costs in the prior year related to the acquisition of the AUC operations in November 2018. Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase of $3.2 million in amortization expense of definite lived intangible assets and $0.3 million higher compensation and benefits expense primarily due to the acquisition of the AUC operations in November 2018. Seven Seas Water SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decline compared to 45.4% for the same period of 2018.\nQuench SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $10.9 million to $59.6 million compared to the prior year. The increase was driven by $6.5 million higher amortization expense primarily related to an increase in intangible assets from recent acquisitions, $4.1 million higher compensation and benefits primarily driven by increased headcount from the inclusion of staff added from certain acquisitions and a $1.3 million increase in general expenses primarily to support the expansion of our operations. Partially offsetting this increase was $1.5 million lower acquisition-related expenses and $0.8 million lower restructuring costs primarily incurred in connection with the PHSI acquisition in December 2018, and a $1.4 million decrease in share-based compensation expense driven by the completion of the vesting of certain equity grants made in connection with our initial public offering in 2016. Quench SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue were 51.7% for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decline compared to 61.5% for the same period of 2018.\nCorporate and Other SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $6.6 million to $11.4 million compared to the same period of 2018, which was driven by $6.6 million of expenses incurred in connection with the definitive merger agreement entered into in December 2019.\nCommencing on December 18, 2018, the Company initiated a restructuring of the PHSI organization which included the reduction of headcount for PHSI executive management and other employee positions determined to be duplicative with those at Quench (the PHSI Restructuring Plan\u201d). Certain of the positions were backfilled with additional positions at Quench depending on the needs of the business. The expected net effect of the restructuring allowed Quench to recognize synergies of reduced employee costs subsequent to the PHSI Acquisition. The restructuring was determined to be a post-combination transaction. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company incurred an incremental restructuring-related charge related to severance, termination benefits and related taxes of $0.1 million and $0.9 million, respectively, which was recorded within SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had accrued approximately $0 and $0.8 million, respectively, within accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company completed the PHSI Restructuring Plan during the second quarter of 2019.\nOther expense\n\nInterest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $10.3 million compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to incremental borrowings of $150 million in connection with expansion of our senior secured credit agreement in November and December 2018.\nOther expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $0.4 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to $0.2 million of loss recorded in the prior year related to the divestiture of the Atlas High Purity Solutions business and $0.1 million of gain on foreign currency transactions during 2019 as compared to 2018.\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n\nWe operate through multiple legal entities in a variety of domestic and international jurisdictions, some of which do not impose an income tax. Within these jurisdictions, our operations generate a mix of income and losses, which cannot be offset when calculating income tax expense or benefit for each legal entity. Income tax benefits are not recorded for losses generated in jurisdictions where either the jurisdictions do not impose an income tax, or we do not believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of such losses.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred a consolidated pre-tax loss of $17.9 million, which was composed of: (i) an aggregate of $26.0 million of pre-tax losses in jurisdictions which either do not impose an income tax or we do not believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of such losses and (ii) an aggregate of $8.1 million of pre-tax income in taxable jurisdictions. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we incurred a consolidated pre-tax loss of $22.0 million, which was composed of: (i) an aggregate of $29.3 million of pre-tax losses in jurisdictions which either do not impose an income tax or we do not believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of such losses and (ii) an aggregate of $7.3 million of pre-tax income in taxable jurisdictions.\nIncome tax (benefit) expense for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $2.2 million and $(1.3) million, respectively. Income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were composed of a current tax of $3.2 million and $2.0 million, respectively, and deferred tax (benefit) expense of $(1.0) million and $(3.3) million, respectively. The increase in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period\nin 2018 was primarily the result of the recognition $3.4 million tax benefit recorded in the prior year for the full release of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in one of our foreign jurisdictions, a gain recorded on the sale of assets in Curacao and an increase in current expense related to withholding taxes. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in income tax expense for our other jurisdictions due to lower taxable income in certain tax paying jurisdictions.\nCash paid for income taxes was $2.3 million and $1.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, our principal sources of liquidity on a consolidated basis were cash and cash equivalents of $103.3 million and $56.6 million, respectively (excluding restricted cash), which were held for working capital, investment and general corporate purposes. In addition, as of both December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had an aggregate of $4.2 million of restricted cash related to debt service reserve funds and minimum balance requirements for one of our borrowings. See Note 2- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Restricted Cash\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our working capital as of December 31, 2019 was $115.2 million compared to $64.6 million as of December 31, 2018.\nIn July 2019, we completed an underwritten sale of 4.7 million ordinary shares at a public offering price of $16.88 per share. We received net proceeds of $75.4 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.\nOur cash and cash equivalents are held by our holding company and our subsidiaries primarily in demand deposits with domestic and international banks, money market accounts, and U.S. Treasury bills. We utilize a combination of equity financing and corporate and project debt financing through international commercial banks and other financial institutions to fund our cash needs and the growth of our business. Our debt financing arrangements contain financial covenants and provisions which govern distributions by the borrowers may limit our ability to transfer cash among us and our subsidiaries. See Note 10- Long-Term Debt-Restricted Net Assets\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a summary of limitations applicable to us and our subsidiaries as of December 31, 2019. Based on our current level of operations, we believe our cash flow from operations and available cash will be adequate to meet the future liquidity needs of our current operations for at least the next twelve months.\nOur expected future liquidity and capital requirements consist principally of:\n \u00b7 capital expenditures and investments in infrastructure under concession arrangements related to maintaining or expanding our existing operations; \n \u00b7 development of new projects and new markets; \n \u00b7 inventory; \n \u00b7 acquisitions; \n \u00b7 costs and expenses relating to our ongoing business operations; and \n \u00b7 debt service requirements on our existing and future debt. \nOur ability to meet our debt service obligations and other capital requirements, including capital expenditures, as well as future acquisitions, will depend on our future operating performance which, in turn, will be subject to general economic, financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other conditions, many of which are beyond our control.\nWe may in the future be required to seek additional equity or debt financing to meet these future capital and liquidity requirements. If additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired or needed, our business, operating results, cash flow and financial condition would be adversely affected. We currently intend to use our available funds and any future cash flow from operations for the conduct and expansion of our business, debt service requirements and general corporate purposes.\nSubsidiary Distribution Policy\nA significant portion of our cash flow is provided by operations from our principal operating subsidiaries and borrowings made at the corporate level.\nWith respect to our Seven Seas Water segment, unless cash balances are expected to be redeployed for further growth opportunities in the same jurisdiction, our distribution policy is to efficiently distribute cash from our international operating subsidiaries to our non-U.S. intermediate holding companies for redeployment in the manner intended to optimize our return on invested capital. However, one of our subsidiaries, as of December 31, 2019, has a loan agreement that restricts distributions to related parties in the event certain financial or nonfinancial covenants are not met, which could reduce our ability to redeploy cash. Distributions are typically in the form of principal and interest payments on intercompany loans, repayment of intercompany advances or other intercompany arrangements, including billings from our Tampa operations center, and dividends. When considering the amount and timing of such distributions, our Seven Seas Water operating subsidiaries must maintain sufficient funds for future capital investment, debt service and general working capital purposes.\nWith respect to our Quench operating segment, our current intent is for Quench to retain cash for working capital, investment for future growth within the segment and for future debt repayment.\nAlthough the governing boards of our subsidiaries have discretion over intercompany dividends or other future distributions, the form, frequency and amount of such distributions will depend on our subsidiaries' future operations and earnings, capital requirements and surplus, general financial condition, contractual requirements of our lenders, tax considerations and other factors that may be deemed relevant.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the following periods:\n\nOperating Activities\nThe significant variations of cash provided by operating activities and net losses are principally related to adjustments to eliminate non-cash and non-operating charges including, but not limited to, amortization, depreciation, share-based compensation, changes in the deferred income tax provision, charges related to the disposal of assets and impairment charges. The largest source of operating cash flow is the collection of trade receivables and our largest use of cash flows is the payment of costs associated with revenue and SG&A expenses.\nCash provided by operations during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $31.0 million and $26.9 million, respectively. The increase in cash flow from operations was primarily due to overall higher operating cash inflows driven by the large acquisitions in late 2018 which was partially offset by higher cash interest expense related to incremental borrowings of $150 million in connection with the expansions of our senior secured credit agreement in November and December 2018.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $52.5 million and $214.6 million, respectively. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to a decrease of $178.8 million of net cash paid for acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the prior year period. This was partially offset by an increase of $17.0 million in capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the prior year period.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash paid for acquisitions was $19.7 million as compared to $198.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 there were $21.0 million and $3.5 million, respectively, of capital expenditures by Seven Seas Water primarily for new plants, plant expansions and capacity upgrades and $15.6 million and $16.1 million, respectively, of capital expenditures for Quench primarily to support existing operations.\nCapital Expenditures on Fixed Assets and Investments in Long-Lived Assets\nFor Seven Seas Water, our primary capital expenditures are composed of construction costs of our plants, including engineering, procurement and construction and equipment costs, internal direct labor and project development costs, which include engineering and environmental studies, permitting and licensing and certain legal costs. Major repairs and maintenance, which improve the efficiency or extend the life of our operating plants, are also included in capital expenditures. In addition to our contractually committed capital expenditures, we routinely explore project investment opportunities in our current and new geographic locations and business lines if we believe that any of the opportunities has the potential to meet our internal investment criteria. In the course of pursuing these investment opportunities, we may successfully bid on projects or operating plants that will require additional capital expenditures. For Quench, our primary capital expenditures are the acquisition of POU systems and related assets as well as typical capital expenditures for leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, computers, field tablets and software.\nFor the fiscal year 2020, we expect to invest approximately $27 million across our Seven Seas Water and Quench segments in capital expenditures, primarily to support growth opportunities. We expect that these investments will be financed through existing cash and cash generated from operations.\nSignificant 2019 Acquisitions\nOn June 1, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Aguaman for an aggregate purchase price of $1.5 million. On July 15, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Carolina Pure for an aggregate purchase price of $7.3 million. On October 1, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Mirex for an aggregate purchase price of $11.6 million.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $68.2 million and $126.1 million, respectively. The $57.8 million net decrease in cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to a decrease of $150.0 million of net proceeds from long-term debt related to incremental borrowings in connection with the expansions of our senior secured credit agreement in November and December 2018. This decrease was partially offset by net proceeds of $75.4 million received in connection with issuance of 4.7 million ordinary shares at a public offering price of $16.88 per share in July 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, long-term debt included the following (in thousands):\n\nCorporate Credit Agreement\nOn August 4, 2017, AquaVenture Holdings Limited, AquaVenture Holdings Peru S.A.C., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and Quench USA, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, (collectively the Borrowers\u201d) entered into a $150.0 million senior secured credit agreement (the Corporate Credit Agreement\u201d) with a syndicate of lenders. The Corporate Credit Agreement is non-amortizing, matures in August 2021, at the time it was incurred, bore interest at LIBOR plus 6.0% with a LIBOR floor of 1.0%. Interest only payments are due quarterly with principal due in full upon maturity.\nOn November 17, 2017, the Corporate Credit Agreement was amended to convert the interest rate applicable to 50% of the then-outstanding principal balance, or $75.0 million, from a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus 6.0% with a LIBOR floor of 1.0% to a fixed rate of 8.2%. The remaining 50% of the then-outstanding principal balance, of $75.0 million, continued to bear interest at LIBOR plus 6.0% with a LIBOR floor of 1.0%. All other material terms of the original credit agreement remained substantially unchanged.\nOn August 28, 2018, the Corporate Credit Agreement was amended to modify certain agreement definitions and non-financial covenants. All other material terms of the original credit agreement remained substantially unchanged.\nOn November 1, 2018, the Corporate Credit Agreement was amended ( Amended Corporate Credit Agreement\u201d) to: (i) add AquaVenture Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, as a borrower under the Amended Corporate Credit Agreement, (ii) increase our net borrowings by $110.0 million to an aggregate principal amount of $260.0 million, (iii) reduce the interest rate for the original $150.0 million borrowings by 50 basis points on both the variable and fixed interest portions and (iv) amend certain financial covenant requirements. Of the incremental net borrowing of $110.0 million, $70.0 million bears interest at a variable rate of LIBOR plus 5.5% with a LIBOR floor of 1.0%, and the remaining $40.0 million bears interest at a fixed rate of 8.7%. In the aggregate, including the aforementioned interest rate reduction, $145.0 million of borrowings bear interest at a variable rate of LIBOR plus 5.5% with a LIBOR floor of 1.0% and the remaining $115.0 million of borrowings bear interest at a weighted average fixed rate of 8.0%. A declining prepayment fee on the incremental borrowing was due upon repayment if it occurred prior to November 1, 2019. All other material terms of the Amended Corporate Credit Agreement remained substantially unchanged.\nOn December 20, 2018, the Corporate Credit Agreement was amended to increase its borrowings by $40.0 million to an aggregate principal amount of $300.0 million. The incremental borrowings bear interest at a variable rate of LIBOR plus 5.5% with a LIBOR floor of 1.0%. A prepayment fee on the incremental borrowing, which declines over time, was due upon repayment if it occurred prior to December 20, 2019. These additional borrowings are non-amortizing and mature in August 2021. All other terms of the Corporate Credit Agreement remained substantially unchanged.\nOn December 10, 2019, the Corporate Credit Agreement was amended to modify certain covenants. All other material terms of the original credit agreement remained substantially unchanged.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the weighted average interest rate was 7.7%.\nThe Corporate Credit Agreement is guaranteed by AquaVenture Holdings Limited along with certain subsidiaries and contains financial and nonfinancial covenants. The financial covenants include minimum interest coverage ratio and maximum leverage ratio requirements, as defined in the Corporate Credit Agreement, and are calculated using consolidated financial information of AquaVenture Holdings Limited excluding the results of AquaVenture (BVI) Holdings Limited and its subsidiary Seven Seas Water (BVI) Limited. In addition, the Corporate Credit Agreement contains customary negative covenants limiting, among other things, indebtedness, investments, liens, dispositions of assets, restricted payments (including dividends), transactions with affiliates, prepayments of indebtedness, capital expenditures, changes in nature of business and amendments to documents. As of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with, or received waivers for breaches of, all such covenants.\nWe may prepay in whole or in part, the outstanding principal and accrued unpaid interest under the Corporate Credit Agreement. The prepayment fee requirement has expired on the original $150.0 million borrowing. The Corporate Credit Agreement is collateralized by certain of the assets of the Borrowers and stated guarantors.\nBVI Loan Agreement\nIn connection with our acquisition of the capital stock of Biwater (BVI) Holdings Limited in June 2015, we inherited the $43.0 million credit facility of its subsidiary, Seven Seas Water (BVI) Ltd., arranged by a bank (the BVI Loan Agreement\u201d). The BVI Loan Agreement closed on November 14, 2013 and was arranged to finance the construction of the 2.8 million GPD desalination facility at Paraquita Bay in Tortola, BVI and other contractual obligations. The BVI Loan Agreement is project financing with recourse only to the stock, assets and cash flow of Seven Seas Water (BVI) Ltd. The BVI Loan Agreement is guaranteed by the United Kingdom Export Finance. As of the acquisition date of June 11, 2015, $40.8 million remained outstanding. In addition, approximately $820 thousand remained available for draw through October 2016. The BVI Loan Agreement was amended on May 7, 2014 and June 11, 2015 to reflect extensions in milestone dates and our acquisition of Seven Seas Water (BVI) Ltd. The BVI Loan Agreement is collateralized by all shares and underlying assets of Seven Seas Water (BVI) Ltd.\nPrior to the amendment on August 4, 2017, the BVI Loan Agreement provided for interest on the outstanding borrowings at LIBOR plus 3.5% per annum and interest was paid quarterly. The loan principal is repayable quarterly beginning in March 31, 2015 in 26 quarterly installments that escalate over the term of the loan.\nOn August 4, 2017, Seven Seas Water (BVI) Ltd. further amended the BVI Loan Agreement to extend the amortization on principal to May 2022 and reduce the spread applied to the LIBOR base rate used in the calculation of interest by 50 basis points to LIBOR plus 3.0% per annum. The United Kingdom Export Finance also extended its participation in the project to match the extended term of the amended BVI Loan Agreement. All other material terms of the original loan agreement remained unchanged.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the weighted-average interest rate was 5.1%. Seven Seas Water (BVI) Ltd. may prepay the principal amounts of the loans prior to the maturity date, in whole or in part.\nThe BVI Loan Agreement includes both financial and nonfinancial covenants, limits the amount of additional indebtedness that Seven Seas Water (BVI) Ltd. can incur and places annual limits on capital expenditures for this subsidiary. The BVI Loan Agreement also places restrictions on distributions made by Seven Seas Water (BVI) Ltd. which is only permitted to make distributions to shareholders and affiliates of AquaVenture Holdings Limited if specified debt service coverage and loan life coverage ratios are met and it is in compliance with all loan covenants. The BVI Loan Agreement contains a number of negative covenants restricting, among other things, indebtedness, investments, liens, dispositions of assets, restricted payments (including dividends), mergers and acquisitions, accounting changes, transactions with affiliates, prepayments of indebtedness, capital expenditures, and changes in nature of business and joint ventures. In addition, Seven Seas Water (BVI) Ltd is subject to quarterly financial covenant compliance, including minimum debt service and loan life coverage ratios, and must maintain a minimum debt service reserve fund and a maintenance reserve fund with the bank in addition to other minimum balance requirements as set forth in the agreement. As of December 31, 2019, Seven Seas Water (BVI) Ltd. was in compliance with, or received waivers for breaches of, all such covenants.\nOther Debt\nWe finance our vehicles primarily under three-year terms with interest rates per annum ranging from 3.0% to 4.5%.\nContractual Obligations and Other Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and other commitments as of December 31, 2019:\n\n (1) We calculated interest on long-term debt based on payment terms that existed at December 31, 2019. Weighted-average interest rates used are as follows: (i) Corporate Credit Agreement-7.7%; (ii) BVI Loan Agreement-5.1%; and (iii) vehicle financing-3.8%. \n (2) Operating leases include total future minimum rent payments under non-cancelable operating lease agreements. \n (3) The asset retirement obligations represent contractual requirements to perform certain asset retirement activities and are based on engineering estimates of future costs to dismantle and remove equipment from a customer's plant site and to restore the site to a specified condition at the conclusion of a contract. We have included the total undiscounted asset retirement obligation, as determined at December 31, 2019, in the table above. \n (4) Acquisition contingent consideration represents the additional purchase price that is contingent on the future performance of an acquired business or collection of certain acquired receivables. We have included the fair value of the total expected amount as of December 31, 2019. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt December 31, 2019, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nOther Matters\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits of $0.7 million and $4.6 million, respectively. Of these amounts, $0.1 million and $3.9 of the Company's unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, have been recorded as a reduction to the related deferred tax asset for the net operating loss in accordance with the FASB issued authoritative guidance relating to the presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists for all periods. The remaining $0.6 million and $0.7 million of the Company's unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, are fully indemnified pursuant to purchase agreements for business combinations and, if realized, would impact the effective tax rate. In addition, the amount of accumulated penalties and interest related to the unrecognized tax benefit was $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded, in the aggregate, an accrued liability of $0.9 million and $1.0 million, respectively, and a corresponding indemnification receivable of $0.9 million and $1.0 million, respectively, related to the uncertain tax benefits and contractual indemnifications. As a result of the indemnifications, the Company does not anticipate any material effect to our operating results, liquidity or financial condition.", "item_7_tables": "Table 134: <table> <tr>

overall revenue.\n- Net loss for 2019 was $20.1 million, slightly less than 2018's net loss of $20.7 million.\n- AquaVenture entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Culligan International
