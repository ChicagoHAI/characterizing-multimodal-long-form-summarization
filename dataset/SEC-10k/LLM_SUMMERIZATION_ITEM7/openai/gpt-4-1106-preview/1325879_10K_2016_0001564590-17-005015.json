Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read the Risk Factors\u201d section in Part 1 - Item 1A of this report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to advancing a broad portfolio of targeted therapeutics for oncology and other areas of unmet medical need. Our proprietary platform has delivered unique insights into cancer and related diseases. Our strategy is to leverage these biomarker insights and partner resources to advance the development of our clinical pipeline.\nOur pipeline includes our lead candidate tivozanib, an oral, once-daily, vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor, or TKI. Tivozanib is a potent, selective and long half-life inhibitor of all three VEGF receptors and is designed to optimize VEGF blockade while minimizing off-target toxicities, potentially resulting in improved efficacy and minimal dose modifications. Tivozanib has been investigated in several tumor types, including renal cell, colorectal and breast cancers.\nIn June 2013, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, issued a complete response letter denying our application for approval of the use of tivozanib in first-line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma, or RCC, citing concerns regarding the negative trend in overall survival in TIVO-1, our first pivotal phase 3 clinical trial.\nIn May 2016, we initiated enrollment and treatment of patients in TIVO-3, a new phase 3 clinical trial of tivozanib, in the third-line treatment of patients with refractory RCC seeking to address the overall survival, or OS, concerns from the TIVO-1 trial presented in the June 2013 complete response letter from the FDA and to support a request for regulatory approval of tivozanib in the United States as a third-line treatment and as a first-line treatment for RCC. We expect to complete enrollment in the TIVO-3 trial in June 2017, and to report top line data in the first quarter of 2018. The TIVO-3 trial passed an initial safety data assessment in February 2017. We expect a pre-planned interim futility analysis to occur mid-year 2017.\nIn March 2017, we initiated enrollment in the TiNivo trial, a phase 1/2 trial of tivozanib in combination with Opdivo\u00ae, or nivolumab, an immune checkpoint, or PD-1, inhibitor, for the treatment of RCC. Bristol-Myers Squibb is supplying nivolumab for the TiNivo trial, and we are the trial sponsor. The TiNivo trial is being led by the Institut Gustave Roussy in Paris under the direction of Professor Bernard Escudier, MD, Chairman of the Genitourinary Oncology Committee. The phase 1 trial will primarily evaluate the safety of tivozanib in combination with nivolumab at escalating doses of tivozanib and, assuming favorable results, is expected to be followed by a phase 2 expansion at the established combination dose. We expect to receive initial data from the phase 1 portion of the TiNivo trial in the first half of 2017.\nIn February 2016, EUSA Pharma (UK) Ltd., or EUSA, our European licensee, submitted a marketing authorization application, or MAA, for tivozanib with the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, for the treatment of RCC. The application was validated in March 2016, confirming that the submission was complete and that the EMA would initiate its review process. EUSA received the Day 120 List of Questions from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the EMA in July 2016, and submitted its responses in November 2016. In January 2017, EUSA received the Day 180 List of Outstanding Issues, or LOI, from the CHMP, of the EMA. The Day 180 LOI signifies that the MAA is not approvable at the present time, and outlines outstanding deficiencies, which are then required to be satisfactorily addressed in an oral explanation and/or in writing prior to a final application decision. EUSA has informed AVEO that it expects to submit written responses to the Day 180 LOI in April 2017, and the EMA has tentatively scheduled EUSA to provide an oral explanation to the CHMP in May 2017.\nWe also have a pipeline of monoclonal antibodies, including:\nTable 264: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (i)\n</td> <td> Ficlatuzumab, a potent hepatocyte growth factor, or HGF, antibody that inhibits the activity of the HGF/c-Met pathway. Ficlatuzumab is in early stage clinical development, with ongoing studies in acute myloid leukemia, or AML, and squamous cell cancer of the head and neck, or SCCHN. We and our worldwide partner Biodesix, Inc., or Biodesix, will share equally in all future costs and profits relating to the development of ficlatuzumab;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 265: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (ii)\n</td> <td> AV-203, a potent, high-affinity inhibitor of the ErbB3 pathway.

To continue as a going concern, we must secure additional capital to provide us with additional liquidity. We believe that our approximate $23.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2016, could allow us to fund our planned operations into the fourth quarter of 2017; however, additional funds will be needed to extend these operations into 2018 and maintain compliance with our $10.0 million financial covenant under our loan agreement with Hercules Technology II, L.P. and Hercules Technology III, L.P., affiliates of Hercules Technology Growth, which we collectively refer to as Hercules. We expect that, in order to obtain additional capital, we will need to complete public or private financings of debt or equity, and / or receive milestone payments from our partners. We may also seek to procure additional funds through future arrangements with collaborators, licensees or other third parties, and these arrangements would generally require us to relinquish or encumber rights to some of our technologies or drug candidates. Moreover, we may not be able receive milestone payments or complete additional financing or enter into such arrangements on acceptable terms, if at all. For more information, refer to -Liquidity and Capital Resources-Operating Capital Requirements and Going Concern\u201d below and Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nStrategic Partnerships\nCANbridge\nIn March 2016, which we refer to as the Effective Date, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with CANbridge, or the CANbridge Agreement, under which we granted CANbridge the exclusive right to develop, manufacture and commercialize AV-203, our proprietary ErbB3 (HER3) inhibitory antibody, for the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease in humans and animals in all countries other than the United States, Canada and Mexico. Under the terms of the CANbridge Agreement, if we determine to grant a license to any ErbB3 inhibitory antibody in the United States, Canada or Mexico, we are obligated to first negotiate with CANbridge for the grant to CANbridge of a license to such rights. The parties have both agreed not to directly or indirectly develop or commercialize any other ErbB3 inhibitory antibody product during the term of the CANbridge Agreement other than pursuant to the CANbridge Agreement.\nCANbridge has responsibility for all activities and costs associated with the further development, manufacture, regulatory filings and commercialization of AV-203 throughout its licensed territory. CANbridge is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and obtain regulatory approval for AV-203 in each of China, Japan, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Spain, and Germany. CANbridge will bear all costs for development of AV-203 through proof-of-concept in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, after which we would expect to contribute to certain worldwide development costs.\nPursuant to the CANbridge Agreement, CANbridge paid us an upfront fee of $1.0 million in April 2016. CANbridge also agreed to reimburse us $1.0 million for certain manufacturing costs and expenses that we previously incurred, $0.5 million of which will be due on the earlier of (i) the date of validation by CANbridge of certain manufacturing development activities we conducted and (ii) twelve months from the Effective Date, and the remaining $0.5 million of which will be due on the earlier of (i) the date of validation by CANbridge of such manufacturing development activities or (ii) eighteen months from the Effective Date. We are also eligible to receive up to $42.0 million in potential development and regulatory milestone payments and up to $90.0 million in potential sales based milestone payments based on annual net sales of licensed products. Upon commercialization, we are eligible to receive a tiered royalty, with a percentage range in the low double-digits, on net sales of approved licensed products. CANbridge's obligation to pay royalties for each licensed product expires on a country-by-country basis on the later of the expiration of patent rights covering such licensed product in such country, the expiration of regulatory data exclusivity in such country and ten years after the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country. A percentage of any milestone and royalty payments received by us, excluding upfront and reimbursement payments, are due to Biogen Idec International GmbH, or Biogen Idec, as a sublicensing fee under our option and license agreement with Biogen dated March 18, 2009, as amended.\nEUSA\nIn December 2015, we entered into a license agreement with EUSA under which we granted to EUSA the exclusive, sublicensable right to develop, manufacture and commercialize tivozanib in the territories of Europe (excluding Russia, Ukraine and the Commonwealth of Independent States), Latin America (excluding Mexico), Africa, Australasia and New Zealand for all diseases and conditions in humans, excluding non-oncologic diseases or conditions of the eye. EUSA is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to seek regulatory approval for and commercialize tivozanib throughout its licensed territories in RCC. With the exception of certain support to be provided by us in connection with the application for marketing approval by the EMA, EUSA has responsibility for all activities and costs associated with the further development, manufacture, regulatory filings and commercialization of tivozanib in its licensed territories.\nUnder the license agreement, EUSA made a research and development funding payment to us of $2.5 million in 2015. EUSA is required to make a further research and development funding payment of $4.0 million if the EMA grants marketing approval for tivozanib for treatment of RCC. We are eligible to receive additional research funding from EUSA, including up to $20.0 million for the data generated by our phase 3 clinical trial in third-line RCC if EUSA elects to utilize such data for regulatory or commercial purposes, and up to $2.0 million for the data generated by a phase 1 combination trial with a checkpoint inhibitor if EUSA elects to utilize such data for regulatory or commercial purposes. We would be entitled to receive milestone payments of $2.0 million per country upon reimbursement approval, if any, for RCC in each of France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, and an additional $2.0 million for the grant of marketing approval, if any, in three of the following five countries: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, South Africa and Venezuela. We are also eligible to receive a payment of $2.0 million in connection with a filing by EUSA with the EMA for marketing approval, if any, for tivozanib for the treatment of each of up to three additional indications and $5.0 million per indication in connection with the EMA's grant of marketing approval for each of up to three additional indications, as well as up to $335.0 million upon EUSA's achievement of certain sales thresholds. We are also eligible to receive tiered double digit royalties on net sales, if any, of licensed products in its licensed territories ranging from a low double digit up to mid-twenty percent depending on the level of annual net sales. Thirty percent of any non-research and development related milestone and royalty payments we receive is due to Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd. (formerly Kirin Brewery Co. Ltd.), or KHK as a sublicensing fee under our license agreement with KHK. The research and development funding payments under the EUSA license agreement are not subject to sublicensing payment to KHK.\nNovartis\nIn August 2015, we entered into a license agreement with Novartis International Pharmaceutical Ltd., or Novartis, under which we granted Novartis the exclusive right to develop and commercialize AV-380 and our related antibodies that bind to GDF15 worldwide. Under this agreement, Novartis is responsible for all activities and costs associated with the further development, regulatory filing and commercialization of AV-380 worldwide.\nNovartis made an upfront payment to us of $15.0 million in September 2015. We are also eligible to receive (a) up to $53.0 million in potential clinical milestone payments and up to $105.0 million in potential regulatory milestone payments tied to the commencement of clinical trials and to regulatory approvals of products developed under the license agreement in the United States, the European Union and Japan; and (b) up to $150.0 million in potential sales based milestone payments based on annual net sales of such products. Upon commercialization, we are eligible to receive tiered royalties on net sales of approved products ranging from the high single digits to the low double-digits. Novartis has responsibility under the license agreement for the development, manufacture and commercialization of the licensed antibodies and any resulting approved therapeutic products. In December 2015, Novartis also exercised its right under the license agreement to acquire our inventory of clinical quality drug substance, reimbursing us approximately $3.5 million for such existing inventory.\nCertain milestones achieved by Novartis would trigger milestone payment obligations from us to St. Vincent's Hospital Sydney Limited, which we refer to as St. Vincent's, under our amended and restated license agreement with St. Vincent's. In addition, royalties on approved products, if any, will be payable to St. Vincent's, and we and Novartis will share that obligation equally.\nPharmstandard\nIn August 2015, we entered into a license agreement with JSC Pharmstandard-Ufimskiy Vitamin Plant,\u201d or Pharmstandard, a company registered under the laws of the Russian Federation. Pharmstandard is a subsidiary of Pharmstandard OJSC. Under the license agreement, we granted to Pharmstandard the exclusive, sublicensable right to develop, manufacture and commercialize tivozanib in the territories of Russia, Ukraine and the Commonwealth of Independent States, for all diseases and conditions in humans, excluding non-oncologic ocular conditions.\nIn June 2016, following unsuccessful efforts to renegotiate certain terms of the Pharmstandard license agreement, Pharmstandard notified us that due to economic and market changes in Russia it was exercising its right to terminate the license\nagreement effective September 9, 2016. Upon termination of the license agreement, the licenses to tivozanib granted to Pharmstandard were terminated, all product rights and regulatory documents were transferred to us, and Pharmstandard is no longer responsible for the development and commercialization of tivozanib in its licensed territories. Pharmstandard filed an application for marketing authorization in Russia for tivozanib for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma that was accepted by the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation in February 2016. This application was withdrawn following Pharmstandard's termination notice.\nOphthotech\nIn November 2014, we entered into a research and exclusive option agreement with Ophthotech Corporation, or Ophthotech, pursuant to which we provided Ophthotech an exclusive option to enter into a definitive license agreement whereby we would grant Ophthotech the right to develop and commercialize tivozanib outside of Asia and the Middle East for the potential diagnosis, prevention and treatment of non-oncologic diseases or conditions of the eye in humans. Pursuant to this option agreement, we granted to Ophthotech an exclusive, royalty-free license or sublicense, as applicable, under intellectual property rights controlled by us solely to perform the research and development activities related to the use of tivozanib for the specific purposes outlined in the agreement during the option period. These activities included formulation work for ocular administration, preclinical research and the conduct of a phase 1/2a proof-of-concept clinical trial of a product containing tivozanib in patients with wet age-related macular degeneration. Ophthotech paid us $0.5 million in consideration for the grant of the option. Such amount is non-refundable and not creditable against any other amounts due under the agreement.\nIn January 2017, Ophthotech notified us that it will not be able to develop tivozanib and exercised its right to terminate the option agreement effective April 3, 2017.\nBiodesix\nIn April 2014, we and Biodesix entered into the Biodesix Agreement to develop and commercialize ficlatuzumab. Under the Biodesix Agreement, we granted Biodesix perpetual, non-exclusive rights to certain intellectual property, including all clinical and biomarker data related to ficlatuzumab, to develop and commercialize VeriStrat\u00ae, Biodesix's proprietary companion diagnostic test. Biodesix granted us perpetual, non-exclusive rights to certain intellectual property, including diagnostic data related to VeriStrat, with respect to the development and commercialization of ficlatuzumab; each license includes the right to sublicense, subject to certain exceptions. Pursuant to a joint development plan, we retain primary responsibility for clinical development of ficlatuzumab. In September 2016, we and Biodesix announced the termination of the FOCAL trial, a phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical study of ficlatuzumab in which VeriStrat was used to select clinical trial subjects.\nUnder the Biodesix Agreement, with the exception of the costs incurred for the FOCAL trial, we and Biodesix are each required to contribute 50% of all clinical, regulatory, manufacturing and other costs to develop ficlatuzumab. Pursuant to the Biodesix Agreement, Biodesix was obligated to fund all costs of the FOCAL trial up to a cap of $15 million, following which all costs of the FOCAL trial would be shared equally. In connection with the discontinuation of the FOCAL trial, on October 14, 2016, we and Biodesix amended the Biodesix Agreement. Under the amendment, we agreed to share 50% of all program costs from August 1, 2016 forward. In return for bearing 50% of the FOCAL closeout costs after August 1, 2016, we will be entitled to recover an agreed multiple of the additional costs borne by us out of any income Biodesix receives from the partnership in connection with the licensing, development or commercialization of ficlatuzumab. We do not anticipate that these remaining costs will be material. Following such recovery, the payment structure under the original Biodesix Agreement, which generally provides that the parties share equally in any costs and revenue, will resume without such modification.\nPending marketing approval or the sublicense of ficlatuzumab, and subject to the negotiation of a commercialization agreement, each party would share equally in commercialization profits and losses, subject to our right to be the lead commercialization party.\nSt. Vincent's Hospital\nIn July 2012, we entered into a license agreement with St. Vincent's, under which we obtained an exclusive, worldwide license to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize products for therapeutic applications that benefit from inhibition or decreased expression or activity of MIC-1, which is also known as GDF15. We believe GDF15 is a novel target for cachexia, and we are exploiting this license in our AV-380 program for cachexia. Under the agreement, we have the right to grant sublicenses subject to certain restrictions. We have a right of first negotiation to obtain an exclusive license to certain improvements that St. Vincent's or third parties may make to licensed therapeutic products. Under the license agreement, St. Vincent's also granted us non-exclusive rights for certain related diagnostic products and research tools.\nIn connection with entering into the original license agreement with St. Vincent's in July 2012, we paid St. Vincent's an upfront license fee of $0.7 million and a low five-figure amount to reimburse St. Vincent's for patent-related expenses it incurred with respect to a specified licensed patent.\nIn August 2015, in connection with the execution of our license agreement with Novartis, we entered into an amended and restated agreement with St. Vincent's, pursuant to which we made an upfront payment to St. Vincent's of $1.5 million. Under our license agreement with St. Vincent's:\nTable 268: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> We (or any sublicensee) are obligated to use diligent efforts to conduct research and clinical development and commercially launch at least one licensed therapeutic product, and to maximize profits from licensed therapeutic products for the benefit of us and St. Vincent's. Subject to certain conditions, we have also agreed to achieve specified research, development and regulatory milestones by specified dates. If we (or a sublicensee) do not achieve a given milestone by the agreed date, we have the option of paying the amount we would have been obligated to pay had we timely achieved the milestone, and, if we do so, St. Vincent's will not have the right to terminate the license agreement based on our failure to timely achieve such milestone.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 269: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> We have agreed that, for as long as there is a valid claim in the licensed patents, we will not, and we will ensure that our affiliates and our sublicensees do not, develop or commercialize any product, other than a licensed therapeutic product, for the treatment, prevention or prophylaxis of cachexia, decreased appetite or body weight, that binds to GDF15 or the GDF15 receptor and that is a GDF15 antagonist, and will not license or induce any other person to do the same.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 270: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> We (or any sublicensee) are required to make milestone payments, up to an aggregate total of $18.9 million, upon the earlier of achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones or a specified date for the first indication, and upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones for the second and third indications, for licensed therapeutic products, some of which payments may be increased by a mid to high double-digit percentage rate for milestones payments made after we grant any sublicense under the license agreement, depending on the sublicensed territory or territories;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 271: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> We (or any sublicensee) will be required to pay tiered royalty payments equal to a low-single-digit percentage of any net sales we or our sublicensees make from licensed therapeutic products, an obligation we share with Novartis equally. The royalty rate escalates within the low-single-digit range during each calendar year based on increasing licensed therapeutic product sales during such calendar year. Our royalty payment obligations for a licensed therapeutic product in a particular country end on the later of 10 years after the date of first commercial sale of such licensed therapeutic product in such country or expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim of the licensed patents covering such licensed therapeutic product in such country, and are subject to offsets under certain circumstances; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 272: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> We (or any sublicensee) will be required to reimburse St. Vincent's for some or all of the reasonable costs and expenses it incurs in patent management, filing, prosecuting and maintaining the licensed patents.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAstellas Pharma\nIn February 2011, we and our wholly-owned subsidiary AVEO Pharma Limited entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Astellas Pharma Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries pursuant to which we and Astellas intended to develop and commercialize tivozanib for the treatment of a broad range of cancers. Astellas elected to terminate the agreement effective August 2014, at which time the tivozanib rights were returned to us. In accordance with the Astellas Agreement, committed development costs, including the costs of completing certain tivozanib clinical development activities, continue to be shared equally.\nBiogen Idec\nIn March 2009, we entered into an exclusive option and license agreement with Biogen Idec regarding the development and commercialization of our discovery-stage ErbB3-targeted antibodies for the potential treatment and diagnosis of cancer and other diseases in humans outside of North America. In March 2014, we amended our agreement with Biogen Idec, and regained worldwide rights to AV-203. Pursuant to the amendment, we were obligated to in good faith use reasonable efforts to seek a collaboration partner to fund further development and commercialization of ErbB3-targeted antibodies. We satisfied this obligation in March 2016 upon entering into our license agreement with CANbridge. We are obligated to pay Biogen Idec a percentage of milestone payments we receive under the CANbridge agreement and single-digit royalty payments on net sales related to the sale of AV-203, up to cumulative maximum amount of $50.0 million.\nKyowa Hakko Kirin\nIn December 2006, we entered into a license agreement with KHK under which we obtained an exclusive license, with the right to grant sublicenses subject to certain restrictions, to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize tivozanib, pharmaceutical\ncompositions thereof and associated biomarkers. Our exclusive license covers all territories in the world except for Asia and the Middle East, where KHK has retained the rights to tivozanib. Under the license agreement, we obtained exclusive rights in our territory under certain KHK patents, patent applications and know-how related to tivozanib, to research, develop, make, have made, use, import, offer for sale, and sell tivozanib for the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of any and all human diseases and conditions. We and KHK each have access to and can benefit from the other party's clinical data and regulatory filings with respect to tivozanib and biomarkers identified in the conduct of activities under the license agreement.\nUnder the license agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize tivozanib in our territory, including meeting certain specified diligence goals. Prior to the first anniversary of the first post-marketing approval sale of tivozanib in our territory, neither we nor any of our subsidiaries has the right to conduct certain clinical trials of, seek marketing approval for or commercialize any other cancer product that also works by inhibiting the activity of a VEGF receptor.\nWe have upfront, milestone and royalty payment obligations to KHK under our license agreement. Upon entering into the license agreement with KHK, we made an upfront payment in the amount of $5.0 million. In March 2010, we made a milestone payment to KHK in the amount of $10.0 million in connection with the dosing of the first patient in our first phase 3 clinical trial of tivozanib (TIVO-1). In December 2012, we made a $12.0 million milestone payment to KHK in connection with the acceptance by the FDA of our 2012 new drug application, or NDA filing for tivozanib. Each milestone under the KHK agreement is a one-time only payment obligation. Accordingly, we did not owe KHK another milestone payment in connection with the dosing of the first patient in our TIVO-3 trial, and would not owe a milestone payment to KHK if we file an NDA with the FDA following the completion of our TIVO-3 clinical trial. If we obtain approval for tivozanib in the U.S., we would owe KHK a one-time milestone payment of $18.0 million, provided that we do not sublicense U.S. rights for tivozanib prior to obtaining a U.S. regulatory approval. If we were to sublicense the U.S. rights, the associated U.S. regulatory milestone would be replaced by a specified percentage of sublicensing revenue, as set forth below.\nIf we sublicense any of our rights to tivozanib to a third party, as we have done with EUSA pursuant to our license agreement, the sublicense defines the payment obligations of the sublicensee, which may vary from the milestone and royalty payment obligations under our KHK license relating to rights we retain. We are required to pay KHK a fixed 30% of amounts we receive from our sublicensees, including upfront license fees, milestone payments and royalties, but excluding amounts we receive in respect of research and development funding or equity investments, subject to certain limitations. In accordance with the sublicensing provisions of our KHK agreement, in 2011 we made a $22.5 million payment to KHK related to the upfront license payment received under a collaboration and license agreement we entered into with Astellas Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the termination of which became effective on August 11, 2014. If tivozanib is approved in the European Union, or EU, the $4.0 million research and development reimbursement milestone that would be owed to us by EUSA would not be subject to a sublicense revenue payment to KHK, nor would a research and development reimbursement payment upon an election by EUSA to use the data generated from our TIVO-3 or TiNivo trials for regulatory or commercial purposes, which could be up to $20.0 million for the TIVO-3 data and up to $2.0 million TiNivo data. We would, however, owe KHK 30% of other, non-research and development payments we may receive from EUSA pursuant to our license agreement, including EU reimbursement approval milestones in up to five specified EU countries, EU marketing approvals for up to three additional indications beyond RCC, marketing approvals in up to three specified licensed territories outside of the EU, sales-based milestones and royalties, as set forth above.\nWe are also required to pay tiered royalty payments on net sales we make of tivozanib in our territory, which range from the low to mid-teens as a percentage of net sales. The royalty rate escalates within this range based on increasing tivozanib sales. Our royalty payment obligations in a particular country in our territory begin on the date of the first commercial sale of tivozanib in that country, and end on the later of 12 years after the date of first commercial sale of tivozanib in that country or the date of the last to expire of the patents covering tivozanib that have been issued in that country.\nThe license agreement will remain in effect until the expiration of all of our royalty and sublicense revenue obligations to KHK, determined on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, unless we elect to terminate the license agreement earlier. If we fail to meet our obligations under the agreement and are unable to cure such failure within specified time periods, KHK can terminate the agreement, resulting in a loss of our rights to tivozanib and an obligation to assign or license to KHK any intellectual property or other rights we may have in tivozanib, including our regulatory filings, regulatory approvals, patents and trademarks for tivozanib.\nFinancial Overview\nWe do not have a history of being profitable and, as of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $521.9 million. We anticipate that we will continue to incur significant operating costs over the next several years as we continue our planned development activities for our preclinical and clinical products. We will need additional funding to support our operating activities, and the timing and nature of activities contemplated for 2017 and thereafter will be conducted subject to the availability of sufficient financial resources. Refer to the -Going Concern\u201d and Liquidity and Capital Resources-Operating Capital Requirements and Going Concern\u201d sections for a further discussion of our funding requirements.\nRevenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales. All of our revenue to date has been derived from license fees, milestone payments, premium over the fair value of convertible preferred shares sold to our strategic partners, and research and development payments received from our strategic partners.\nIn the future, we may generate revenue from a combination of product sales, license fees, milestone payments and research and development payments in connection with strategic partnerships, and royalties resulting from the sales of products developed under licenses of our intellectual property. We expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing and amount of license fees, research and development reimbursements, milestone and other payments received under our strategic partnerships, and the payments that we receive upon the sale of our products, to the extent any are successfully commercialized. We do not expect to generate revenue from product sales in the near term. If we or our strategic partners fail to complete the development of our drug candidates in a timely manner or obtain regulatory approval for them, our ability to generate future revenue, and our results of operations and financial position, would be materially adversely affected.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses have historically consisted of expenses incurred in connection with the discovery and development of our product candidates. We recognize research and development expenses as they are incurred. These expenses consist primarily of:\nTable 273: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> employee-related expenses, which include salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 274: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, investigative sites and consultants that conduct our clinical trials and a substantial portion of our preclinical studies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 275: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the cost of acquiring and manufacturing drug development related materials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 276: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the cost of completing certain tivozanib clinical development activities that were initiated as part of our prior partnership with Astellas;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 277: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> facilities, depreciation and other allocated expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and equipment, and depreciation of fixed assets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 278: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> license fees for, and milestone payments related to, in-licensed products and technology; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 279: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> costs associated with outsourced development activities, regulatory approvals and medical affairs\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses are net of amounts reimbursed under our agreements with Astellas and Biodesix for Astellas' and Biodesix' respective shares of development costs incurred by us under our joint development plans with each respective partner.\nWe expect that research and development expenses in 2017 will remain at current levels as we seek to advance and complete enrollment in the TIVO-3 trial and the TiNivo trial.\nWe track external development expenses and personnel expense on a program-by-program basis and allocate common expenses, such as scientific consultants and laboratory supplies, to each program based on the personnel resources allocated to such program. Facilities, depreciation, stock-based compensation, research and development management and research and development support services are not allocated among programs and are considered overhead. Below is a summary of our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively:\nTable 280: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2016 / 2015 Comparison\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2015 / 2014 Comparison\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tivozanib\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,530\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,017\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AV-380 Program in Cachexia\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,944\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (81\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10,560\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (81\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ficlatuzumab\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,579\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,499\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (95\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AV-203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (456\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (86\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,311\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (71\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other pipeline programs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (61\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (85\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (57\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (85\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Overhead\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,195\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (135\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10,874\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (89\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,703\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 38,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (25,379\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (66\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTivozanib\nWe have pursued partnering options to fund further tivozanib development in appropriate clinical settings outside of our strategic focus. Our licensee, EUSA, has submitted an application for marketing authorization for tivozanib for the treatment of RCC to the EMA. EUSA is responsible for all activities and costs associated with the further development and commercialization of tivozanib within its licensed territories, excluding non-oncologic diseases or conditions of the eye. We continue to share the costs of development activities to which we and Astellas were committed at the time the Astellas partnership was terminated.\nIn May 2016, we initiated TIVO-3, an additional phase 3 trial of tivozanib vs. sorafenib. TIVO-3, which is expected to enroll approximately 322 patients in the refractory RCC setting, will use progression-free survival, or PFS, as the primary endpoint and OS as a secondary endpoint, and is designed to address the OS concerns presented in the June 2013 complete response letter from the FDA and to support a request for approval of tivozanib as a third-line treatment and as a first-line treatment. We expect the total estimated remaining costs of this trial, including drug supply and distribution, to be approximately $22.0 million to $25.0 million through completion. We have also initiated the TiNivo trial in collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb, or BMS, which is providing nivolumab for the study. We are the study sponsor. The TiNivo trial is a phase 1/2 trial of tivozanib in combination with nivolumab, a PD-1 inhibitor, for the treatment of RCC, for which our costs, including tivozanib drug supply and distribution, could be in the range of $2.0 million to $2.5 million.\nAV-380 Program in Cachexia\nIn August 2015, we entered into a license agreement with Novartis, under which we granted Novartis the exclusive right to develop and commercialize AV-380 and related AVEO antibodies that bind to GDF15 worldwide. Under this agreement, Novartis is responsible for all activities and costs associated with the further development, regulatory filing and commercialization of AV-380 worldwide. We do not expect to incur any significant costs related to AV-380 in future periods beyond any milestone fees and royalties payable to St.Vincent's pursuant to our in-licensing agreement, which comprises substantially all of the costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAV-203\nIn March 2014, we regained our worldwide rights from Biogen Idec to develop, manufacture and commercialize AV-203. In March 2016, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with CANbridge, under which we granted CANbridge the exclusive right to develop and commercialize AV-203 in all countries other than the United States, Canada and Mexico. CANbridge is responsible for all costs of developing and commercializing AV-203 within its licensed territory. For a period of time following the completion of certain proof-of-concept clinical studies by CANbridge involving the use of AV-203 for the treatment of squamous cell esophagus cancer, we agreed to negotiate exclusively with CANbridge for (a) the right to co-develop ErbB3 inhibitory antibody products for the treatment of squamous cell esophagus cancer or (b) the right to include the United States, Canada and Mexico as part of the licensed territories. We do not expect to incur any significant costs related to AV-203 prior to CANbridge's completion of a proof-of-concept clinical study.\nFiclatuzumab\nIn April 2014, we entered into the Biodesix Agreement to develop and commercialize ficlatuzumab, our potent HGF inhibitory antibody. Pursuant to the agreement, Biodesix was to provide up to $15.0 million for the phase 2 FOCAL trial of ficlatuzumab in combination with erlotinib in first-line advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients selected using Biodesix's proprietary companion diagnostic VeriStrat. In connection with the discontinuation of the FOCAL trial, on October 14, 2016 we and Biodesix amended the Biodesix Agreement. Under the amendment, we agreed to fund 50% of the shutdown costs of the FOCAL trial after August 1, 2016. In return, we would be entitled to reimbursement at a multiple of such shutdown expenses out of any future revenues Biodesix receives from ficlatuzumab. All manufacturing and all non-FOCAL development, regulatory or commercial expenses for ficlatuzumab will continue to be equally shared, as provided in the original Biodesix Agreement. Due to the unpredictable nature of clinical development, we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur in the future development of ficlatuzumab.\nUncertainties of Estimates Related to Research and Development Expenses\nThe process of conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials necessary to obtain FDA approval for each of our product candidates is costly and time-consuming. The probability of success for each product candidate and clinical trial may be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the quality of the product candidate's early clinical data, investment in the program, competition, manufacturing capabilities and commercial viability.\nAt this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, specific timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of our product candidates, or the period, if any, in which material net cash inflows may commence from sales of any approved products. This uncertainty is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs, including the uncertainty of:\nTable 281: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our ability to establish and maintain strategic partnerships, the terms of those strategic partnerships and the success of those strategic partnerships, if any, including the timing and amount of payments that we might receive from strategic partners;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 282: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the scope, progress, results and costs of preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for any product candidate;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 283: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the progress and results of our clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 284: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 285: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the emergence of competing technologies and products and other adverse market developments; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 286: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property-related claims.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs a result of the uncertainties associated with developing drugs, including those discussed above, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of current or future clinical stages of our product candidates, or when, or to what extent, we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates. Development timelines, probability of success and development costs vary widely. We anticipate that we will make determinations as to which additional programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific and clinical success, if any, of each product candidate, as well as ongoing assessment of each product candidate's commercial potential. We will need to raise substantial additional capital in the future in order to fund the development of our preclinical and clinical product candidates.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and related costs for personnel in executive, finance, corporate development, information technology, legal and human resource functions. Other general and administrative expenses include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, patent filing, prosecution and defense costs and professional fees for legal, consulting, pre-commercialization activities, auditing and tax services. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses in 2017 will remain at current levels.\nWarrants Issued in Connection with Private Placement\nWe account for warrant instruments that either conditionally or unconditionally obligate the issuer to transfer assets as liabilities regardless of the timing of the redemption feature or price, even though the underlying shares may be classified as permanent or temporary equity. These warrants are subject to revaluation at each balance sheet date, and any changes in fair value are recorded as a non-cash component of other expense, until the earlier of their exercise or expiration or upon the completion of a liquidation event.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest income consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The primary objective of our investment policy is capital preservation. Interest expense consists of interest, amortization of debt discount, and amortization of deferred financing costs associated with our loans payable.\nIncome Taxes\nWe calculate our provision for income taxes on ordinary income based on our projected annual tax rate for the year. We recorded a loss for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, and since we maintain a full valuation allowance on all of our deferred tax assets, we have recorded no income tax provision or benefit during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, except for a $0.1 million provision recorded in the year ended December 31, 2016 related to withholding taxes incurred in a foreign jurisdiction.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, accrued clinical expenses, and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we and our management believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenues have historically been generated primarily through collaborative research, development and commercialization agreements. The terms of these agreements generally contain multiple elements, or deliverables, which may include (i) licenses, or options to obtain licenses, to our technology, (ii) research and development activities to be performed on behalf of the collaborative partner, and (iii) in certain cases, services in connection with the manufacturing of pre-clinical and clinical material. Payments to us under these arrangements typically include one or more of the following: non-refundable, upfront license fees; option exercise fees; funding of research and/or development efforts; milestone payments; and royalties on future product sales.\nWhen evaluating multiple element arrangements, we consider whether the deliverables under the arrangement represent separate units of accounting. This evaluation requires subjective determinations and requires management to make judgments about the individual deliverables and whether such deliverables are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship. In determining the units of accounting, management evaluates certain criteria, including whether the deliverables have standalone value, based on the relevant facts and circumstances for each arrangement. The consideration received is allocated among the separate units of accounting using the relative selling price method, and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units.\nWe determine the estimated selling price for deliverables within each agreement using vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of selling price, if available, third-party evidence, or TPE, of selling price if VSOE is not available, or best estimate of selling price if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. Determining the best estimate of selling price for a deliverable requires significant judgment. We typically use best estimates of selling price to estimate the selling price for licenses to our proprietary technology, since we often do not have VSOE or TPE of selling price for these deliverables. In those circumstances where we utilize the best estimate of selling price to determine the estimated selling price of a license to our proprietary technology, we consider market conditions as well as entity-specific factors, including those factors contemplated in negotiating the agreements and internally developed models that include assumptions related to the market opportunity, estimated development costs, probability of success and the time needed to commercialize a product candidate pursuant to the applicable license. In validating our best estimate of selling price, we evaluate whether changes in the key assumptions used to determine the best estimate of selling price will have a significant effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration among multiple deliverables.\nWe typically receive non-refundable, upfront payments when licensing our intellectual property in conjunction with a research and development agreement. When management believes the license to our intellectual property does not have stand-alone value from the other deliverables to be provided in the arrangement, we generally recognize revenue attributed to the license on a straight-line basis over our contractual or estimated performance period, which is typically the term of our research and development obligations. If management cannot reasonably estimate when our performance obligation ends, then revenue is deferred until management can\nreasonably estimate when the performance obligation ends. When management believes the license to our intellectual property has stand-alone value, we generally recognize revenue attributed to the license upon delivery. The periods over which revenue should be recognized are subject to estimates by management and may change over the course of the research and development agreement. Such a change could have a material impact on the amount of revenue we record in future periods.\nPayments or reimbursements resulting from our research and development efforts for those arrangements where such efforts are considered as deliverables are recognized as the services are performed and are presented on a gross basis so long as there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. Amounts received prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying balance sheets.\nAt the inception of each agreement that includes milestone payments, we evaluate whether each milestone is substantive and at risk to both parties on the basis of the contingent nature of the milestone. This evaluation includes an assessment of whether (a) the consideration is commensurate with either (1) the entity's performance to achieve the milestone, or (2) the enhancement of the value of the delivered item(s) as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the entity's performance to achieve the milestone, (b) the consideration relates solely to past performance, and (c) the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement. We evaluate factors such as the scientific, regulatory, commercial and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the respective milestone, the level of effort and investment required to achieve the respective milestone and whether the milestone consideration is reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement in making this assessment.\nWe aggregate our milestones into four categories: (i) clinical and development milestones, (ii) regulatory milestones, (iii) commercial milestones, and (iv) patent-related milestones. Clinical and development milestones are typically achieved when a product candidate advances into a defined phase of clinical research or completes such phase. For example, a milestone payment may be due to us upon the initiation of a phase 3 clinical trial for a new indication, which is the last phase of clinical development and could eventually contribute to marketing approval by the FDA or other global regulatory authorities. Regulatory milestones are typically achieved upon acceptance of the submission for marketing approval of a product candidate or upon approval to market the product candidate by the FDA or other global regulatory authorities. For example, a milestone payment may be due to us upon the FDA's acceptance of a New Drug Application, or NDA. Commercial milestones are typically achieved when an approved pharmaceutical product reaches certain defined levels of net sales by the licensee, such as when a product first achieves global sales or annual sales of a specified amount. Patent-related milestones are typically achieved when a patent application is filed or a patent is issued with respect to certain intellectual property related to the applicable collaboration.\nRevenues from clinical and development, regulatory, and patent-related milestone payments, if the milestones are deemed substantive and the milestone payments are nonrefundable, are recognized upon successful accomplishment of the milestones. We have concluded that the clinical and development, regulatory and patent-related milestones pursuant to our current research and development arrangements are substantive. Milestones that are not considered substantive are accounted for as license payments and recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining period of performance. Revenues from commercial milestone payments are accounted for as royalties and are recorded as revenue upon achievement of the milestone, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\nAccrued Expenses and Accrued Clinical Trial Costs and Contract Research Liabilities\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate accrued expenses. This process involves identifying services which have been performed on our behalf, and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements. Given our current business, the primary area of uncertainty concerning accruals which could have a material effect on our operating results is with respect to service fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of clinical drug supplies and to contract research organizations in connection with our clinical trials. In connection with all of the foregoing service fees, our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided. The majority of our service providers, including contract research organizations, invoice us in arrears for services performed. In the event that we do not identify some costs which have begun to be incurred, or we under or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services in a given period, our reported expenses for such period would be understated or overstated. We currently reflect the effects of any changes in estimates based on changes in facts and circumstances directly in our operations in the period such change becomes known.\nOur arrangements with contract research organizations in connection with clinical trials often provide for payment prior to commencing the project or based upon predetermined milestones throughout the period during which services are expected to be performed. We recognize expense relating to these arrangements based on the various services provided over the estimated time to completion. The date on which services commence, the level of services performed on or before a given date, and the cost of such services are often determined based on subjective judgments. We make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances\nknown to us based on the terms of the contract and our ongoing monitoring of service performance. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we had arrangements with multiple contract research organizations whereby these organizations commit to performing services for us over multiple reporting periods. We recognize the expenses associated with these arrangements based on our expectation of the timing of the performance of components under these arrangements by these organizations. Generally, these components consist of the costs of setting up the trial, monitoring the trial, closing the trial and preparing the resulting data. Costs related to patient enrollment in clinical trials are accrued as patients are enrolled in the trial.\nWith respect to financial reporting periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and based on our receipt of invoices from our third party providers, the timing of our actual costs incurred have not differed materially from our estimated timing of such costs. In light of the foregoing, we do not believe our practices for estimating future expenses and making judgments concerning the accrual of expenses are reasonably likely to change in the future.\nStock-Based Compensation\nUnder our stock-based compensation programs, we periodically grant stock options and restricted stock to employees, directors and nonemployee consultants. We also issue shares under an employee stock purchase plan. The fair value of all awards is recognized in our statements of operations over the requisite service period for each award.\nAwards that vest as the recipient provides service are expensed on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Other awards, such as performance-based awards that vest upon the achievement of specified goals, are expensed using the accelerated attribution method if achievement of the specified goals is considered probable. We have also granted awards that vest upon the achievement of market conditions. Per Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 718 Share-Based Payments, market conditions must be considered in determining the estimated grant-date fair value of share-based payments and the market conditions must be considered in determining the requisite service period over which compensation cost is recognized. We estimate the fair value of the awards with market conditions using a Monte Carlo simulation, which utilizes several assumptions including the risk-free interest rate, the volatility of our stock and the exercise behavior of award recipients. The grant-date fair value of the awards is then recognized over the requisite service period, which represents the derived service period for the awards as determined by the Monte Carlo simulation.\nWe use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value our stock option awards without market conditions, which requires us to make certain assumptions regarding the expected volatility of our common stock price, the expected term of the option grants, the risk-free interest rate and the dividend yield with respect to our common stock. In 2016, we began calculating volatility using our historical data. Previously, we did not have sufficient history to support a calculation of volatility using only our historical data. As such, prior to 2016, we used a weighted-average volatility considering our own volatility since March 2010 and the volatilities of several peer companies. For purposes of identifying similar entities, we considered characteristics such as industry, length of trading history, similar vesting terms and in-the-money option status. Due to a lack of our own historical data, we elected to use the simplified\u201d method for plain vanilla\u201d options to estimate the expected term of our stock option grants. Under this approach, the weighted-average expected life is presumed to be the average of the vesting term and the contractual term of the option. The risk-free interest rate used for each grant is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for instruments with a similar expected life. We utilize a dividend yield of zero based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and have no present intention to pay cash dividends.\nThe fair value of equity-classified awards to employees and directors are measured at fair value on the date the awards are granted. Awards to nonemployee consultants are recorded at their fair values and are re-measured as of each balance sheet date until the recipient's services are complete.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes pricing model for new grants were as follows:\nTable 287: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Volatility factor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 72.18% - 74.47%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 73.04% - 78.70%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 69.38% - 77.92%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected term (in years)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.00 - 6.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.50 - 6.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.50 - 6.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk-free interest rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.07% - 2.01%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.54% - 1.93%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.81% - 2.02%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dividend yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe recognized stock-based compensation expense of approximately $1.0 million, $1.1 million and $2.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. During the years ending December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we estimated our expected forfeiture rates to be 76%, 71% and 62%, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $0.8 million of\ntotal unrecognized stock-based compensation expense for stock options, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.5 years.\nWe record compensation expense only for those awards that we ultimately expect will vest. We have performed an historical analysis of option awards that were forfeited prior to vesting and recorded total stock option expense that reflected this estimated forfeiture rate. We cannot currently predict the total amount of stock-based compensation expense to be recognized in any future period because such amounts will depend on levels of stock-based payments granted in the future as well as the portion of the awards that actually vest. Forfeitures are estimated each period and adjusted if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Actual forfeitures may differ from our estimates as a result of significant changes in our operations.\nWe have historically granted stock options at exercise prices that are not less than the fair market value of our common stock.\nWarrants Issued in Connection with Private Placement\nWe account for warrant instruments that either conditionally or unconditionally obligate the issuer to transfer assets as liabilities regardless of the timing of the redemption feature or price, even though the underlying shares may be classified as permanent or temporary equity. In May 2016, we issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 17,642,482 shares of our common stock in connection with a private placement financing and recorded the warrants as a liability. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources-Private Placement/PIPE Warrants\u201d below. The fair value of these warrants has been determined using the Black-Scholes pricing model. These warrants are subject to revaluation at each balance sheet date, and any changes in fair value are recorded as a non-cash component of other income (expense), net in our Statements of Operations until the earlier of their exercise or expiration or upon the completion of a liquidation event.\nThe key assumptions used to value the PIPE Warrants were as follows:\nTable 288: <table> <tr>

2015 related to Novartis for the $15.0 million upfront payment received in connection with our licensing agreement entered into in August 2015 and $3.5 million for the purchase of our inventory of clinical material in the fourth quarter of 2015. This decrease was partially offset by the $1.0 million upfront payment received in connection with our collaboration and license agreement with CANbridge entered into in March 2016 and $0.8 million in the acceleration of deferred revenue that was recognized upon the effective termination of our licensing agreement with Pharmstandard in September 2016 that otherwise would have been recognized over the performance period through April 2022.\nIn 2015 as compared to 2014, revenue increased by $0.9 million principally due to the recognition of $18.5 million of revenue associated with the receipt of a $15.0 million upfront payment for our license of AV-380 to Novartis and Novartis' subsequent purchase of clinical material for $3.5 million. These amounts were partially offset by a decrease of $3.6 million of revenue from Astellas following the termination of our collaboration agreement in 2014 and a decrease of $14.3 million of revenue recognized from our arrangement with Biogen due to the one-time recognition of previously deferred revenue following an amendment to our agreement in 2014.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nTable 290: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2016 / 2015 Comparison\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2015 / 2014 Comparison\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tivozanib\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,530\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,017\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AV-380 Program in Cachexia\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,944\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (81\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10,560\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (81\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ficlatuzumab\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,579\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,499\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (95\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AV-203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (456\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (86\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,311\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (71\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other pipeline programs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (61\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (85\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (57\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (85\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Overhead\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,195\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (135\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10,874\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (89\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,703\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 38,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (25,379\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (66\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2016 as compared to 2015, research and development expenses increased by $10.8 million due to a $12.7 million increase in tivozanib, principally related to the advancement of the TIVO-3 trial that commenced patient enrollment and treatment in May 2016. This increase was partially offset by a $1.5 million decrease related to the upfront fee incurred under the amended St. Vincent's license agreement entered into in August 2015. We expect that research and development expenses in 2017 will remain at current levels as we seek to advance and complete enrollment in the TIVO-3 and TiNivo trials.\nIn 2015 as compared to 2014, research and development expenses decreased by $25.4 million principally attributable to a $7.8 million decrease in employee compensation, benefits, contract labor and consulting and a decrease of $9.2 million in facilities, IT, and other costs following our January 2015 restructuring; a decrease of $7.6 million in outsourced services costs primarily related to the completion of the manufacture of AV-380 material in 2014; and a decrease of $0.8 million in medical affairs and external clinical trial costs associated with the decreased number of active patients enrolled in our clinical trials.\nIncluded in research and development expenses were stock-based compensation expenses of approximately $0.3 million in each of 2016 and 2015, and $0.9 million in 2014.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nTable 291: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2016 / 2015 Comparison\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2015 / 2014 Comparison\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,205\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (6,012\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (42\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (4,372\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (24\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2016 as compared to 2015, general and administrative expenses decreased by $6.0 million, principally the result of a $4.8 million decrease in external costs associated with various ongoing legal matters, including $4.0 million related to the settlement of SEC claims and $0.8 million in legal fees, as well as a $0.7 million decrease in employee compensation following our decreased headcount and the reduction of our utilized facility space following our 2015 restructuring.

In May 2016, we raised approximately $20.3 million in net cash proceeds, consisting of $15.4 million in net proceeds from a private placement of 17,642,842 units, each including one share of our common stock and a warrant to purchase one share of our common stock, and $4.9 million in net proceeds from additional borrowings under our Hercules loan agreement. As of December 31, 2016, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $23.3 million. See -Operating Capital Requirements and Going Concern\u201d below and Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of our liquidity and the conditions and events which raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. Currently, our funds are invested in a U.S. government money market fund, and corporate debt securities, including commercial paper.

Cash used in operations was due principally to our net loss adjusted for non-cash items and changes in working capital.\nOur investing activities used cash of $0.8 million and $6.3 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, and provided $54.7 million in 2014. Cash used by investing activities in each of 2016 and 2015 was principally the net result of the purchase of marketable securities, partially offset by the maturities of marketable securities in each period and proceeds from the sale of equipment of $1.2 million in 2015. Cash provided by investing activities in 2014 was the net result of maturities of marketable securities, partially offset by the purchase of marketable securities and purchases of property and equipment of $12.9 million.\nOur financing activities provided cash of $20.3 million and $1.0 million in 2016 and 2014, respectively, and used cash of $1.1 million in 2015. In 2016, we raised approximately $20.3 million in net cash proceeds, consisting of $15.4 million in net proceeds from a private placement of 17,642,842 units, each including one share of our common stock and a warrant to purchase one share of our common stock, or the PIPE Warrants, and $4.9 million in net proceeds from additional borrowings under our Hercules loan agreement. In 2015, we raised approximately $10.5 million in net proceeds from the sale of our common stock, including $10.2 million under our at-the-market, or ATM, facility with FBR & Co., or FBR, (formerly MLV & Co. LLC), and $0.3 million from the issuance of stock for stock-based compensation arrangements, offset by $11.6 million in principal payments under our Hercules loan agreement. In 2014, we raised approximately $8.8 million in net cash proceeds, including $8.6 million in net proceeds from the additional borrowings under our Hercules loan agreement and $0.2 million from the issuance of stock for stock-based compensation arrangements offset by $7.8 million in principal payments on loans payable to Hercules.\nPrivate Placement / PIPE Warrants\nIn May 2016, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with a select group of qualified institutional buyers, institutional accredited investors and accredited investors pursuant to which we sold 17,642,482 units, at a price of $0.965 per unit, for gross proceeds of approximately $17.0 million. Each unit consisted of one share of our common stock and a warrant to purchase one share of our common stock, which we refer to as the PIPE Warrants. The PIPE Warrants have an exercise price of $1.00 per share and are exercisable in any manner at any time for a period of five years from the date of issuance. Certain of our directors and executive officers purchased an aggregate of 544,039 units in this offering at the same price as the other investors. The net offering proceeds to us were approximately $15.4 million after deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses payable by us.\nThe PIPE Warrants contain a provision giving the warrant holder the option to receive cash, equal to the fair value of the remaining unexercised portion of the warrant, as cash settlement in the event that there is a fundamental transaction (contractually defined to include various merger, acquisition or stock transfer activities). Due to this provision, ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity requires that these warrants be classified as a liability and not as equity. Accordingly, we recorded a warrant liability in the amount of approximately $9.3 million. The fair value of these warrants has been determined using the Black-Scholes pricing model and the changes in the fair value at the time of each reporting date are recorded in the Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded an approximate $4.8 million gain in fair value in the Statements of Operations that principally resulted from the lower stock price as of the December 31, 2016 reporting date. As of December 31, 2016, none of the PIPE Warrants have been exercised.\nAt-The-Market Issuance Sales Agreement with FBR\nIn February 2015, we entered into an at-the-market issuance sales agreement, which we refer to as the Sales Agreement, with FBR & Co., or FBR, (formerly MLV & Co. LLC), pursuant to which we could issue and sell shares of our common stock from time to time up to an aggregate amount of $17.9 million, at our option, through FBR as our sales agent. Sales of common stock through FBR may be made by any method that is deemed an at-the-market\u201d offering as defined in Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Sales Agreement, FBR will use commercially reasonable efforts to sell our common stock based upon our instructions (including any price, time or size limits or other customary parameters or conditions we may impose). We are not obligated to make any sales of common stock under the Sales Agreement. Any shares sold will be sold pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3. We are required to pay FBR a commission of up to 3% of the gross proceeds. The Sales Agreement may be terminated by us at any time.\nOn May 7, 2015, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, which we refer to as the 2015 Shelf. The 2015 Shelf covers the offering, issuance and sale of up to $100 million of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and/or units. The 2015 Shelf was filed to replace our then existing $250 million shelf registration statement, which expired at the end of May 2015, and which we refer to as the 2012 Shelf. On May 7, 2015, we also amended the Sales Agreement to provide for the offering, issuance and sale of up to $15.0 million of our common stock under the 2015 Shelf. The prior at-the-market offering initiated under the original Sales Agreement expired along with the 2012 Shelf. As of December 31, 2016, we have sold approximately 5.9 million shares pursuant to the Sales Agreement, as amended, resulting in proceeds of approximately $10.2 million, net of commissions and issuance costs. No shares have been sold during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nApproximately $9.1 million remains available for sale under the Sales Agreement.\nCredit Facilities\nOn May 28, 2010, we entered into a loan and security agreement, or the Loan Agreement, with Hercules. The Loan Agreement was subsequently amended in March 2012, or the 2012 Amendment; September 2014, or the 2014 Amendment; and May 2016, or the 2016 Amendment. Amounts borrowed under the 2012 Amendment were repaid in full in 2015.\nPursuant to the 2014 Amendment, we received additional loan proceeds from Hercules in the amount of $10.0 million and were not required to commence principal payments until May 1, 2016. An end-of-term payment of approximately $0.5 million continues to be due on January 1, 2018 or on such earlier date if the loan is prepaid.\nPursuant to the 2016 Amendment, we received additional loan proceeds from Hercules in the amount of $5.0 million, which increased the aggregate outstanding principal balance under the Loan Agreement to $15.0 million. We are not required to commence principal payments on the $15.0 million loan until July 1, 2017, at which time we will be required to make 30 equal monthly payments of principal and interest through December 2019. An end-of-term payment of approximately $0.2 million is due on December 1, 2019. The 2016 Amendment includes a financial covenant that requires us to maintain an unrestricted cash position greater than or equal to $10.0 million through the date of completion of our Phase 3 TIVO-3 trial. Refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion of the adverse consequences of failure to comply with the financial covenant.\nUnder the 2016 Amendment, from March 1, 2017 through June 30, 2017, we may draw down an additional $5.0 million in funding upon the satisfaction of the following conditions: (i) achieving developmental progression satisfactory to Hercules on a minimum of two (2) clinical programs (other than the Phase 3 TIVO-3 trial) that are either managed directly by us or funded, in whole or in part, by us and (ii) having an unrestricted cash position greater than or equal to $25.0 million on the date of the draw down request. If we draw down the additional $5.0 million in funding, the commencement of principal payments on the aggregate $20.0 million loan balance will be deferred by six months from July 1, 2017 until January 1, 2018.\nWe must make interest payments on the principal balance of the loan each month it remains outstanding. Per annum interest is payable on the loan balance at the greater of 11.9% and an amount equal to 11.9% plus the prime rate minus 4.75%, as determined daily, provided however, that the per annum interest rate shall not exceed 15.0%. Our annual interest rate as of December 31, 2016 was 11.9%.\nWe have determined that the risk of subjective acceleration under the material adverse events clause included in this loan and security agreement is remote and, therefore, have classified the outstanding principal amount in current and long-term liabilities based on the timing of scheduled principal payments. As of December 31, 2016, we are in compliance with all of the financial covenants and, through the date of this filing, the lenders have not asserted any events of default under the loan. We do not believe that there has been a material adverse change as defined in the loan agreement.\nThe loans are secured by a lien on all of our personal property (other than intellectual property), whether owned as of, or acquired after, the date of the Loan Agreement.\nOperating Capital Requirements and Going Concern\nWe have devoted substantially all of our resources to our drug development efforts, comprised of research and development, manufacturing, conducting clinical trials for our product candidates, protecting our intellectual property and general and administrative functions relating to these operations. Our future success is dependent on our ability to develop our product candidates and ultimately upon our ability to attain profitable operations. As of December 31, 2016, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling approximately $23.3 million, working capital of $16.0 million and an accumulated deficit of $521.9 million.\nWe anticipate that we will continue to incur significant operating losses for the next several years as we incur expenses to continue to execute on our clinical development strategy to advance our clinical stage assets. We will require substantial additional funds to continue our development programs and to fulfill our planned operating goals. In particular, our currently planned operating and capital requirements include the need for substantial working capital to support our development activities for tivozanib. For example, we estimate that the remaining costs for the TIVO-3 trial for RCC, including drug supply and distribution, could be in the range of $22.0 million to $25.0 million in the aggregate through 2018. We have also initiated the TiNivo trial in collaboration with BMS, which is providing nivolumab for the study. We are the study sponsor. The TiNivo trial is a phase 1/2 study of tivozanib combined with nivolumab, a PD-1 inhibitor, for the treatment of patients with RCC for which our costs, including tivozanib drug supply and distribution, could be in the range of $2.0 million to $2.5 million through 2018. Moreover, we have future payment obligations and cost-sharing arrangements under certain of our collaboration and license agreements. For example, under our agreements with KHK and St. Vincent's, we are required to make certain clinical and regulatory milestone payments, have royalty obligations with respect to product sales and are required to pay a specified percentage of sublicense revenue in certain instances.\nWe are subject to a number of risks, including the need for substantial additional capital for clinical research and product development and the risk that we are unable to maintain compliance with our financial covenant pursuant to our Loan Agreement with Hercules, which requires us to maintain unrestricted cash (defined as cash and liquid cash, including marketable securities) greater\nthan or equal to $10.0 million through the date of completion of our Phase 3 TIVO-3 trial. Non-compliance with the financial covenant would be considered an event of default that could result in Hercules, at its option, accelerating and demanding payment of all outstanding obligations together with a prepayment charge. Refer to Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further description of our Loan Agreement.\nBased upon our approximate $23.3 million in existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2016, we do not have sufficient cash on hand to support operations and maintain compliance with the $10.0 million financial covenant under our Loan Agreement with Hercules for at least the next twelve months from the date of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur plans to address these conditions include pursuing one or more of the following steps to raise additional funding, none of which can be guaranteed or are entirely within our control:\nTable 302: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Raise funding through the possible sales of our common stock, including public or private equity financings.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 303: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Raise funding of up to $9.1 million through possible sales of our common stock under our Sales Agreement with FBR.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 304: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Satisfy the conditions that are set forth in our Loan Agreement with Hercules that would enable us to draw down an additional $5.0 million in funding under the Loan Agreement, as further described in -Credit Facilities\u201d above. If we draw down the additional $5.0 million in funding, the commencement of principal payments on the aggregate $20.0 million loan balance will be deferred by six months from July 1, 2017 until January 1, 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 305: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Continue to seek a partner to advance development of the AV-353 platform for the potential treatment of PAH.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 306: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Earn milestone payments pursuant to collaboration and license agreements or restructure / monetize existing potential milestone and/or royalty payments under those collaboration and license agreements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThere can be no assurance, however, that we will receive cash proceeds from any of these potential resources or, to the extent cash proceeds are received, those proceeds would be sufficient to support our operations and allow us to maintain compliance with our financial covenant for at least the next twelve months from the date of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have concluded the likelihood that our plan to obtain sufficient funding from one or more of these sources will be successful, while reasonably possible, is less than probable. Accordingly, we have concluded that substantial doubt exists regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe believe that our approximate $23.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2016 could allow us to fund our planned operations into the fourth quarter of 2017. This estimate assumes no receipt of milestone payments from our partners or related payment of potential licensing milestones to third parties, no additional funding from new partnership agreements, no equity financings, no debt financings, no accelerated repayment of our term loan and no further sales of equity under our Sales Agreement with FBR. Accordingly, the timing and nature of activities contemplated for 2017 and thereafter will be conducted subject to the availability of sufficient financial resources.\nThere are numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products. Accordingly, our future funding requirements may vary from our current expectations and will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\nTable 307: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our ability to establish and maintain strategic partnerships, licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of such agreements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 308: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the number and characteristics of the product candidates we pursue;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 309: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing our product candidates, and of conducting preclinical and clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 310: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the timing of, and the costs involved in, obtaining regulatory approvals for our product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 311: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims, including litigation costs and the outcome of such litigation;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 312: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the absence of any breach, acceleration event or event of default under our loan agreement with Hercules or under any other agreements with third parties;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 313: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the outcome of legal actions against us, including the current lawsuits described in Part I, Item 3 of this report under the heading Legal Proceedings\u201d;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 314: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the cost of commercialization activities if any of our product candidates are approved for sale, including marketing, sales and distribution costs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 315: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the cost of manufacturing our product candidates and any products we successfully commercialize;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 316: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the timing, receipt and amount of sales of, or royalties on, our future products, if any; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 317: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our ability to continue as a going concern.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe will require additional funding to extend our planned operations into 2018 and maintain compliance with our financial covenant under our Loan Agreement with Hercules. We may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities or preferred stock or through additional credit facilities, these securities and/or the loans under credit facilities could provide for rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. Additional funds may not be available when we need them, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. We also expect to seek additional funds through arrangements with collaborators, licensees or other third parties. These arrangements would generally require us to relinquish or encumber rights to some of our technologies or drug candidates, and we may not be able to enter into such arrangements on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to raise substantial additional capital in the near term, whether on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all then we may trigger an event of default under our Loan Agreement with Hercules and we may be required to:\nTable 318: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> delay, limit, reduce or terminate our clinical trials or other development activities for one or more of our product candidates; and/or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 319: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> delay, limit, reduce or terminate our establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities that may be necessary to commercialize our product candidates, if approved.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have, during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under applicable SEC rules.\nTable 320: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read the Risk Factors\u201d section in Part 1 - Item 1A of this report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to advancing a broad portfolio of targeted therapeutics for oncology and other areas of unmet medical need. Our proprietary platform has delivered unique insights into cancer and related diseases. Our strategy is to leverage these biomarker insights and partner resources to advance the development of our clinical pipeline.\nOur pipeline includes our lead candidate tivozanib, an oral, once-daily, vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor, or TKI. Tivozanib is a potent, selective and long half-life inhibitor of all three VEGF receptors and is designed to optimize VEGF blockade while minimizing off-target toxicities, potentially resulting in improved efficacy and minimal dose modifications. Tivozanib has been investigated in several tumor types, including renal cell, colorectal and breast cancers.\nIn June 2013, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, issued a complete response letter denying our application for approval of the use of tivozanib in first-line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma, or RCC, citing concerns regarding the negative trend in overall survival in TIVO-1, our first pivotal phase 3 clinical trial.\nIn May 2016, we initiated enrollment and treatment of patients in TIVO-3, a new phase 3 clinical trial of tivozanib, in the third-line treatment of patients with refractory RCC seeking to address the overall survival, or OS, concerns from the TIVO-1 trial presented in the June 2013 complete response letter from the FDA and to support a request for regulatory approval of tivozanib in the United States as a third-line treatment and as a first-line treatment for RCC. We expect to complete enrollment in the TIVO-3 trial in June 2017, and to report top line data in the first quarter of 2018. The TIVO-3 trial passed an initial safety data assessment in February 2017. We expect a pre-planned interim futility analysis to occur mid-year 2017.\nIn March 2017, we initiated enrollment in the TiNivo trial, a phase 1/2 trial of tivozanib in combination with Opdivo\u00ae, or nivolumab, an immune checkpoint, or PD-1, inhibitor, for the treatment of RCC. Bristol-Myers Squibb is supplying nivolumab for the TiNivo trial, and we are the trial sponsor. The TiNivo trial is being led by the Institut Gustave Roussy in Paris under the direction of Professor Bernard Escudier, MD, Chairman of the Genitourinary Oncology Committee. The phase 1 trial will primarily evaluate the safety of tivozanib in combination with nivolumab at escalating doses of tivozanib and, assuming favorable results, is expected to be followed by a phase 2 expansion at the established combination dose. We expect to receive initial data from the phase 1 portion of the TiNivo trial in the first half of 2017.\nIn February 2016, EUSA Pharma (UK) Ltd., or EUSA, our European licensee, submitted a marketing authorization application, or MAA, for tivozanib with the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, for the treatment of RCC. The application was validated in March 2016, confirming that the submission was complete and that the EMA would initiate its review process. EUSA received the Day 120 List of Questions from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the EMA in July 2016, and submitted its responses in November 2016. In January 2017, EUSA received the Day 180 List of Outstanding Issues, or LOI, from the CHMP, of the EMA. The Day 180 LOI signifies that the MAA is not approvable at the present time, and outlines outstanding deficiencies, which are then required to be satisfactorily addressed in an oral explanation and/or in writing prior to a final application decision. EUSA has informed AVEO that it expects to submit written responses to the Day 180 LOI in April 2017, and the EMA has tentatively scheduled EUSA to provide an oral explanation to the CHMP in May 2017.\nWe also have a pipeline of monoclonal antibodies, including:\n (i) Ficlatuzumab, a potent hepatocyte growth factor, or HGF, antibody that inhibits the activity of the HGF/c-Met pathway. Ficlatuzumab is in early stage clinical development, with ongoing studies in acute myloid leukemia, or AML, and squamous cell cancer of the head and neck, or SCCHN. We and our worldwide partner Biodesix, Inc., or Biodesix, will share equally in all future costs and profits relating to the development of ficlatuzumab; \n (ii) AV-203, a potent, high-affinity inhibitor of the ErbB3 pathway. Our partner CANbridge Life Sciences Ltd., or CANbridge, will fund manufacturing and clinical development through proof-of-concept in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; \n (iii) AV-380, a potent, humanized IgG1 inhibitory monoclonal antibody targeting growth differentiating factor-15, or GDF15, a divergent member of the TGF-\u00df family, for the potential treatment or prevention of cachexia. We have licensed AV-380 to Novartis, which will fund all development, manufacturing and commercialization; and \n (iv) The AV-353 platform, a family of potent inhibitory antibody candidates specific to Notch 3, one of which has demonstrated an ability in preclinical models to potentially reverse disease phenotype for pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH. We are currently seeking a partner to advance development of the AV-353 platform for the potential treatment of PAH. \nGoing Concern\nWe have identified conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. To continue as a going concern, we must secure additional capital to provide us with additional liquidity. We believe that our approximate $23.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2016, could allow us to fund our planned operations into the fourth quarter of 2017; however, additional funds will be needed to extend these operations into 2018 and maintain compliance with our $10.0 million financial covenant under our loan agreement with Hercules Technology II, L.P. and Hercules Technology III, L.P., affiliates of Hercules Technology Growth, which we collectively refer to as Hercules. We expect that, in order to obtain additional capital, we will need to complete public or private financings of debt or equity, and / or receive milestone payments from our partners. We may also seek to procure additional funds through future arrangements with collaborators, licensees or other third parties, and these arrangements would generally require us to relinquish or encumber rights to some of our technologies or drug candidates. Moreover, we may not be able receive milestone payments or complete additional financing or enter into such arrangements on acceptable terms, if at all. For more information, refer to -Liquidity and Capital Resources-Operating Capital Requirements and Going Concern\u201d below and Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nStrategic Partnerships\nCANbridge\nIn March 2016, which we refer to as the Effective Date, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with CANbridge, or the CANbridge Agreement, under which we granted CANbridge the exclusive right to develop, manufacture and commercialize AV-203, our proprietary ErbB3 (HER3) inhibitory antibody, for the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease in humans and animals in all countries other than the United States, Canada and Mexico. Under the terms of the CANbridge Agreement, if we determine to grant a license to any ErbB3 inhibitory antibody in the United States, Canada or Mexico, we are obligated to first negotiate with CANbridge for the grant to CANbridge of a license to such rights. The parties have both agreed not to directly or indirectly develop or commercialize any other ErbB3 inhibitory antibody product during the term of the CANbridge Agreement other than pursuant to the CANbridge Agreement.\nCANbridge has responsibility for all activities and costs associated with the further development, manufacture, regulatory filings and commercialization of AV-203 throughout its licensed territory. CANbridge is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and obtain regulatory approval for AV-203 in each of China, Japan, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Spain, and Germany. CANbridge will bear all costs for development of AV-203 through proof-of-concept in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, after which we would expect to contribute to certain worldwide development costs.\nPursuant to the CANbridge Agreement, CANbridge paid us an upfront fee of $1.0 million in April 2016. CANbridge also agreed to reimburse us $1.0 million for certain manufacturing costs and expenses that we previously incurred, $0.5 million of which will be due on the earlier of (i) the date of validation by CANbridge of certain manufacturing development activities we conducted and (ii) twelve months from the Effective Date, and the remaining $0.5 million of which will be due on the earlier of (i) the date of validation by CANbridge of such manufacturing development activities or (ii) eighteen months from the Effective Date. We are also eligible to receive up to $42.0 million in potential development and regulatory milestone payments and up to $90.0 million in potential sales based milestone payments based on annual net sales of licensed products. Upon commercialization, we are eligible to receive a tiered royalty, with a percentage range in the low double-digits, on net sales of approved licensed products. CANbridge's obligation to pay royalties for each licensed product expires on a country-by-country basis on the later of the expiration of patent rights covering such licensed product in such country, the expiration of regulatory data exclusivity in such country and ten years after the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country. A percentage of any milestone and royalty payments received by us, excluding upfront and reimbursement payments, are due to Biogen Idec International GmbH, or Biogen Idec, as a sublicensing fee under our option and license agreement with Biogen dated March 18, 2009, as amended.\nEUSA\nIn December 2015, we entered into a license agreement with EUSA under which we granted to EUSA the exclusive, sublicensable right to develop, manufacture and commercialize tivozanib in the territories of Europe (excluding Russia, Ukraine and the Commonwealth of Independent States), Latin America (excluding Mexico), Africa, Australasia and New Zealand for all diseases and conditions in humans, excluding non-oncologic diseases or conditions of the eye. EUSA is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to seek regulatory approval for and commercialize tivozanib throughout its licensed territories in RCC. With the exception of certain support to be provided by us in connection with the application for marketing approval by the EMA, EUSA has responsibility for all activities and costs associated with the further development, manufacture, regulatory filings and commercialization of tivozanib in its licensed territories.\nUnder the license agreement, EUSA made a research and development funding payment to us of $2.5 million in 2015. EUSA is required to make a further research and development funding payment of $4.0 million if the EMA grants marketing approval for tivozanib for treatment of RCC. We are eligible to receive additional research funding from EUSA, including up to $20.0 million for the data generated by our phase 3 clinical trial in third-line RCC if EUSA elects to utilize such data for regulatory or commercial purposes, and up to $2.0 million for the data generated by a phase 1 combination trial with a checkpoint inhibitor if EUSA elects to utilize such data for regulatory or commercial purposes. We would be entitled to receive milestone payments of $2.0 million per country upon reimbursement approval, if any, for RCC in each of France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, and an additional $2.0 million for the grant of marketing approval, if any, in three of the following five countries: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, South Africa and Venezuela. We are also eligible to receive a payment of $2.0 million in connection with a filing by EUSA with the EMA for marketing approval, if any, for tivozanib for the treatment of each of up to three additional indications and $5.0 million per indication in connection with the EMA's grant of marketing approval for each of up to three additional indications, as well as up to $335.0 million upon EUSA's achievement of certain sales thresholds. We are also eligible to receive tiered double digit royalties on net sales, if any, of licensed products in its licensed territories ranging from a low double digit up to mid-twenty percent depending on the level of annual net sales. Thirty percent of any non-research and development related milestone and royalty payments we receive is due to Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd. (formerly Kirin Brewery Co. Ltd.), or KHK as a sublicensing fee under our license agreement with KHK. The research and development funding payments under the EUSA license agreement are not subject to sublicensing payment to KHK.\nNovartis\nIn August 2015, we entered into a license agreement with Novartis International Pharmaceutical Ltd., or Novartis, under which we granted Novartis the exclusive right to develop and commercialize AV-380 and our related antibodies that bind to GDF15 worldwide. Under this agreement, Novartis is responsible for all activities and costs associated with the further development, regulatory filing and commercialization of AV-380 worldwide.\nNovartis made an upfront payment to us of $15.0 million in September 2015. We are also eligible to receive (a) up to $53.0 million in potential clinical milestone payments and up to $105.0 million in potential regulatory milestone payments tied to the commencement of clinical trials and to regulatory approvals of products developed under the license agreement in the United States, the European Union and Japan; and (b) up to $150.0 million in potential sales based milestone payments based on annual net sales of such products. Upon commercialization, we are eligible to receive tiered royalties on net sales of approved products ranging from the high single digits to the low double-digits. Novartis has responsibility under the license agreement for the development, manufacture and commercialization of the licensed antibodies and any resulting approved therapeutic products. In December 2015, Novartis also exercised its right under the license agreement to acquire our inventory of clinical quality drug substance, reimbursing us approximately $3.5 million for such existing inventory.\nCertain milestones achieved by Novartis would trigger milestone payment obligations from us to St. Vincent's Hospital Sydney Limited, which we refer to as St. Vincent's, under our amended and restated license agreement with St. Vincent's. In addition, royalties on approved products, if any, will be payable to St. Vincent's, and we and Novartis will share that obligation equally.\nPharmstandard\nIn August 2015, we entered into a license agreement with JSC Pharmstandard-Ufimskiy Vitamin Plant,\u201d or Pharmstandard, a company registered under the laws of the Russian Federation. Pharmstandard is a subsidiary of Pharmstandard OJSC. Under the license agreement, we granted to Pharmstandard the exclusive, sublicensable right to develop, manufacture and commercialize tivozanib in the territories of Russia, Ukraine and the Commonwealth of Independent States, for all diseases and conditions in humans, excluding non-oncologic ocular conditions.\nIn June 2016, following unsuccessful efforts to renegotiate certain terms of the Pharmstandard license agreement, Pharmstandard notified us that due to economic and market changes in Russia it was exercising its right to terminate the license\nagreement effective September 9, 2016. Upon termination of the license agreement, the licenses to tivozanib granted to Pharmstandard were terminated, all product rights and regulatory documents were transferred to us, and Pharmstandard is no longer responsible for the development and commercialization of tivozanib in its licensed territories. Pharmstandard filed an application for marketing authorization in Russia for tivozanib for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma that was accepted by the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation in February 2016. This application was withdrawn following Pharmstandard's termination notice.\nOphthotech\nIn November 2014, we entered into a research and exclusive option agreement with Ophthotech Corporation, or Ophthotech, pursuant to which we provided Ophthotech an exclusive option to enter into a definitive license agreement whereby we would grant Ophthotech the right to develop and commercialize tivozanib outside of Asia and the Middle East for the potential diagnosis, prevention and treatment of non-oncologic diseases or conditions of the eye in humans. Pursuant to this option agreement, we granted to Ophthotech an exclusive, royalty-free license or sublicense, as applicable, under intellectual property rights controlled by us solely to perform the research and development activities related to the use of tivozanib for the specific purposes outlined in the agreement during the option period. These activities included formulation work for ocular administration, preclinical research and the conduct of a phase 1/2a proof-of-concept clinical trial of a product containing tivozanib in patients with wet age-related macular degeneration. Ophthotech paid us $0.5 million in consideration for the grant of the option. Such amount is non-refundable and not creditable against any other amounts due under the agreement.\nIn January 2017, Ophthotech notified us that it will not be able to develop tivozanib and exercised its right to terminate the option agreement effective April 3, 2017.\nBiodesix\nIn April 2014, we and Biodesix entered into the Biodesix Agreement to develop and commercialize ficlatuzumab. Under the Biodesix Agreement, we granted Biodesix perpetual, non-exclusive rights to certain intellectual property, including all clinical and biomarker data related to ficlatuzumab, to develop and commercialize VeriStrat\u00ae, Biodesix's proprietary companion diagnostic test. Biodesix granted us perpetual, non-exclusive rights to certain intellectual property, including diagnostic data related to VeriStrat, with respect to the development and commercialization of ficlatuzumab; each license includes the right to sublicense, subject to certain exceptions. Pursuant to a joint development plan, we retain primary responsibility for clinical development of ficlatuzumab. In September 2016, we and Biodesix announced the termination of the FOCAL trial, a phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical study of ficlatuzumab in which VeriStrat was used to select clinical trial subjects.\nUnder the Biodesix Agreement, with the exception of the costs incurred for the FOCAL trial, we and Biodesix are each required to contribute 50% of all clinical, regulatory, manufacturing and other costs to develop ficlatuzumab. Pursuant to the Biodesix Agreement, Biodesix was obligated to fund all costs of the FOCAL trial up to a cap of $15 million, following which all costs of the FOCAL trial would be shared equally. In connection with the discontinuation of the FOCAL trial, on October 14, 2016, we and Biodesix amended the Biodesix Agreement. Under the amendment, we agreed to share 50% of all program costs from August 1, 2016 forward. In return for bearing 50% of the FOCAL closeout costs after August 1, 2016, we will be entitled to recover an agreed multiple of the additional costs borne by us out of any income Biodesix receives from the partnership in connection with the licensing, development or commercialization of ficlatuzumab. We do not anticipate that these remaining costs will be material. Following such recovery, the payment structure under the original Biodesix Agreement, which generally provides that the parties share equally in any costs and revenue, will resume without such modification.\nPending marketing approval or the sublicense of ficlatuzumab, and subject to the negotiation of a commercialization agreement, each party would share equally in commercialization profits and losses, subject to our right to be the lead commercialization party.\nSt. Vincent's Hospital\nIn July 2012, we entered into a license agreement with St. Vincent's, under which we obtained an exclusive, worldwide license to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize products for therapeutic applications that benefit from inhibition or decreased expression or activity of MIC-1, which is also known as GDF15. We believe GDF15 is a novel target for cachexia, and we are exploiting this license in our AV-380 program for cachexia. Under the agreement, we have the right to grant sublicenses subject to certain restrictions. We have a right of first negotiation to obtain an exclusive license to certain improvements that St. Vincent's or third parties may make to licensed therapeutic products. Under the license agreement, St. Vincent's also granted us non-exclusive rights for certain related diagnostic products and research tools.\nIn connection with entering into the original license agreement with St. Vincent's in July 2012, we paid St. Vincent's an upfront license fee of $0.7 million and a low five-figure amount to reimburse St. Vincent's for patent-related expenses it incurred with respect to a specified licensed patent.\nIn August 2015, in connection with the execution of our license agreement with Novartis, we entered into an amended and restated agreement with St. Vincent's, pursuant to which we made an upfront payment to St. Vincent's of $1.5 million. Under our license agreement with St. Vincent's:\n \u2022 We (or any sublicensee) are obligated to use diligent efforts to conduct research and clinical development and commercially launch at least one licensed therapeutic product, and to maximize profits from licensed therapeutic products for the benefit of us and St. Vincent's. Subject to certain conditions, we have also agreed to achieve specified research, development and regulatory milestones by specified dates. If we (or a sublicensee) do not achieve a given milestone by the agreed date, we have the option of paying the amount we would have been obligated to pay had we timely achieved the milestone, and, if we do so, St. Vincent's will not have the right to terminate the license agreement based on our failure to timely achieve such milestone. \n \u2022 We have agreed that, for as long as there is a valid claim in the licensed patents, we will not, and we will ensure that our affiliates and our sublicensees do not, develop or commercialize any product, other than a licensed therapeutic product, for the treatment, prevention or prophylaxis of cachexia, decreased appetite or body weight, that binds to GDF15 or the GDF15 receptor and that is a GDF15 antagonist, and will not license or induce any other person to do the same. \n \u2022 We (or any sublicensee) are required to make milestone payments, up to an aggregate total of $18.9 million, upon the earlier of achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones or a specified date for the first indication, and upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones for the second and third indications, for licensed therapeutic products, some of which payments may be increased by a mid to high double-digit percentage rate for milestones payments made after we grant any sublicense under the license agreement, depending on the sublicensed territory or territories; \n \u2022 We (or any sublicensee) will be required to pay tiered royalty payments equal to a low-single-digit percentage of any net sales we or our sublicensees make from licensed therapeutic products, an obligation we share with Novartis equally. The royalty rate escalates within the low-single-digit range during each calendar year based on increasing licensed therapeutic product sales during such calendar year. Our royalty payment obligations for a licensed therapeutic product in a particular country end on the later of 10 years after the date of first commercial sale of such licensed therapeutic product in such country or expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim of the licensed patents covering such licensed therapeutic product in such country, and are subject to offsets under certain circumstances; and \n \u2022 We (or any sublicensee) will be required to reimburse St. Vincent's for some or all of the reasonable costs and expenses it incurs in patent management, filing, prosecuting and maintaining the licensed patents. \nAstellas Pharma\nIn February 2011, we and our wholly-owned subsidiary AVEO Pharma Limited entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Astellas Pharma Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries pursuant to which we and Astellas intended to develop and commercialize tivozanib for the treatment of a broad range of cancers. Astellas elected to terminate the agreement effective August 2014, at which time the tivozanib rights were returned to us. In accordance with the Astellas Agreement, committed development costs, including the costs of completing certain tivozanib clinical development activities, continue to be shared equally.\nBiogen Idec\nIn March 2009, we entered into an exclusive option and license agreement with Biogen Idec regarding the development and commercialization of our discovery-stage ErbB3-targeted antibodies for the potential treatment and diagnosis of cancer and other diseases in humans outside of North America. In March 2014, we amended our agreement with Biogen Idec, and regained worldwide rights to AV-203. Pursuant to the amendment, we were obligated to in good faith use reasonable efforts to seek a collaboration partner to fund further development and commercialization of ErbB3-targeted antibodies. We satisfied this obligation in March 2016 upon entering into our license agreement with CANbridge. We are obligated to pay Biogen Idec a percentage of milestone payments we receive under the CANbridge agreement and single-digit royalty payments on net sales related to the sale of AV-203, up to cumulative maximum amount of $50.0 million.\nKyowa Hakko Kirin\nIn December 2006, we entered into a license agreement with KHK under which we obtained an exclusive license, with the right to grant sublicenses subject to certain restrictions, to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize tivozanib, pharmaceutical\ncompositions thereof and associated biomarkers. Our exclusive license covers all territories in the world except for Asia and the Middle East, where KHK has retained the rights to tivozanib. Under the license agreement, we obtained exclusive rights in our territory under certain KHK patents, patent applications and know-how related to tivozanib, to research, develop, make, have made, use, import, offer for sale, and sell tivozanib for the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of any and all human diseases and conditions. We and KHK each have access to and can benefit from the other party's clinical data and regulatory filings with respect to tivozanib and biomarkers identified in the conduct of activities under the license agreement.\nUnder the license agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize tivozanib in our territory, including meeting certain specified diligence goals. Prior to the first anniversary of the first post-marketing approval sale of tivozanib in our territory, neither we nor any of our subsidiaries has the right to conduct certain clinical trials of, seek marketing approval for or commercialize any other cancer product that also works by inhibiting the activity of a VEGF receptor.\nWe have upfront, milestone and royalty payment obligations to KHK under our license agreement. Upon entering into the license agreement with KHK, we made an upfront payment in the amount of $5.0 million. In March 2010, we made a milestone payment to KHK in the amount of $10.0 million in connection with the dosing of the first patient in our first phase 3 clinical trial of tivozanib (TIVO-1). In December 2012, we made a $12.0 million milestone payment to KHK in connection with the acceptance by the FDA of our 2012 new drug application, or NDA filing for tivozanib. Each milestone under the KHK agreement is a one-time only payment obligation. Accordingly, we did not owe KHK another milestone payment in connection with the dosing of the first patient in our TIVO-3 trial, and would not owe a milestone payment to KHK if we file an NDA with the FDA following the completion of our TIVO-3 clinical trial. If we obtain approval for tivozanib in the U.S., we would owe KHK a one-time milestone payment of $18.0 million, provided that we do not sublicense U.S. rights for tivozanib prior to obtaining a U.S. regulatory approval. If we were to sublicense the U.S. rights, the associated U.S. regulatory milestone would be replaced by a specified percentage of sublicensing revenue, as set forth below.\nIf we sublicense any of our rights to tivozanib to a third party, as we have done with EUSA pursuant to our license agreement, the sublicense defines the payment obligations of the sublicensee, which may vary from the milestone and royalty payment obligations under our KHK license relating to rights we retain. We are required to pay KHK a fixed 30% of amounts we receive from our sublicensees, including upfront license fees, milestone payments and royalties, but excluding amounts we receive in respect of research and development funding or equity investments, subject to certain limitations. In accordance with the sublicensing provisions of our KHK agreement, in 2011 we made a $22.5 million payment to KHK related to the upfront license payment received under a collaboration and license agreement we entered into with Astellas Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the termination of which became effective on August 11, 2014. If tivozanib is approved in the European Union, or EU, the $4.0 million research and development reimbursement milestone that would be owed to us by EUSA would not be subject to a sublicense revenue payment to KHK, nor would a research and development reimbursement payment upon an election by EUSA to use the data generated from our TIVO-3 or TiNivo trials for regulatory or commercial purposes, which could be up to $20.0 million for the TIVO-3 data and up to $2.0 million TiNivo data. We would, however, owe KHK 30% of other, non-research and development payments we may receive from EUSA pursuant to our license agreement, including EU reimbursement approval milestones in up to five specified EU countries, EU marketing approvals for up to three additional indications beyond RCC, marketing approvals in up to three specified licensed territories outside of the EU, sales-based milestones and royalties, as set forth above.\nWe are also required to pay tiered royalty payments on net sales we make of tivozanib in our territory, which range from the low to mid-teens as a percentage of net sales. The royalty rate escalates within this range based on increasing tivozanib sales. Our royalty payment obligations in a particular country in our territory begin on the date of the first commercial sale of tivozanib in that country, and end on the later of 12 years after the date of first commercial sale of tivozanib in that country or the date of the last to expire of the patents covering tivozanib that have been issued in that country.\nThe license agreement will remain in effect until the expiration of all of our royalty and sublicense revenue obligations to KHK, determined on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, unless we elect to terminate the license agreement earlier. If we fail to meet our obligations under the agreement and are unable to cure such failure within specified time periods, KHK can terminate the agreement, resulting in a loss of our rights to tivozanib and an obligation to assign or license to KHK any intellectual property or other rights we may have in tivozanib, including our regulatory filings, regulatory approvals, patents and trademarks for tivozanib.\nFinancial Overview\nWe do not have a history of being profitable and, as of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $521.9 million. We anticipate that we will continue to incur significant operating costs over the next several years as we continue our planned development activities for our preclinical and clinical products. We will need additional funding to support our operating activities, and the timing and nature of activities contemplated for 2017 and thereafter will be conducted subject to the availability of sufficient financial resources. Refer to the -Going Concern\u201d and Liquidity and Capital Resources-Operating Capital Requirements and Going Concern\u201d sections for a further discussion of our funding requirements.\nRevenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales. All of our revenue to date has been derived from license fees, milestone payments, premium over the fair value of convertible preferred shares sold to our strategic partners, and research and development payments received from our strategic partners.\nIn the future, we may generate revenue from a combination of product sales, license fees, milestone payments and research and development payments in connection with strategic partnerships, and royalties resulting from the sales of products developed under licenses of our intellectual property. We expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing and amount of license fees, research and development reimbursements, milestone and other payments received under our strategic partnerships, and the payments that we receive upon the sale of our products, to the extent any are successfully commercialized. We do not expect to generate revenue from product sales in the near term. If we or our strategic partners fail to complete the development of our drug candidates in a timely manner or obtain regulatory approval for them, our ability to generate future revenue, and our results of operations and financial position, would be materially adversely affected.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses have historically consisted of expenses incurred in connection with the discovery and development of our product candidates. We recognize research and development expenses as they are incurred. These expenses consist primarily of:\n \u2022 employee-related expenses, which include salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense; \n \u2022 expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, investigative sites and consultants that conduct our clinical trials and a substantial portion of our preclinical studies; \n \u2022 the cost of acquiring and manufacturing drug development related materials; \n \u2022 the cost of completing certain tivozanib clinical development activities that were initiated as part of our prior partnership with Astellas; \n \u2022 facilities, depreciation and other allocated expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and equipment, and depreciation of fixed assets; \n \u2022 license fees for, and milestone payments related to, in-licensed products and technology; and \n \u2022 costs associated with outsourced development activities, regulatory approvals and medical affairs \nResearch and development expenses are net of amounts reimbursed under our agreements with Astellas and Biodesix for Astellas' and Biodesix' respective shares of development costs incurred by us under our joint development plans with each respective partner.\nWe expect that research and development expenses in 2017 will remain at current levels as we seek to advance and complete enrollment in the TIVO-3 trial and the TiNivo trial.\nWe track external development expenses and personnel expense on a program-by-program basis and allocate common expenses, such as scientific consultants and laboratory supplies, to each program based on the personnel resources allocated to such program. Facilities, depreciation, stock-based compensation, research and development management and research and development support services are not allocated among programs and are considered overhead. Below is a summary of our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively:\nTable 280: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2016 / 2015 Comparison\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2015 / 2014 Comparison\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tivozanib\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,530\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,017\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AV-380 Program in Cachexia\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,944\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (81\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10,560\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (81\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ficlatuzumab\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,579\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,499\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (95\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AV-203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (456\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (86\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,311\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (71\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other pipeline programs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (61\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (85\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (57\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (85\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Overhead\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,195\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (135\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10,874\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (89\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,703\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 38,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (25,379\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (66\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTivozanib\nWe have pursued partnering options to fund further tivozanib development in appropriate clinical settings outside of our strategic focus. Our licensee, EUSA, has submitted an application for marketing authorization for tivozanib for the treatment of RCC to the EMA. EUSA is responsible for all activities and costs associated with the further development and commercialization of tivozanib within its licensed territories, excluding non-oncologic diseases or conditions of the eye. We continue to share the costs of development activities to which we and Astellas were committed at the time the Astellas partnership was terminated.\nIn May 2016, we initiated TIVO-3, an additional phase 3 trial of tivozanib vs. sorafenib. TIVO-3, which is expected to enroll approximately 322 patients in the refractory RCC setting, will use progression-free survival, or PFS, as the primary endpoint and OS as a secondary endpoint, and is designed to address the OS concerns presented in the June 2013 complete response letter from the FDA and to support a request for approval of tivozanib as a third-line treatment and as a first-line treatment. We expect the total estimated remaining costs of this trial, including drug supply and distribution, to be approximately $22.0 million to $25.0 million through completion. We have also initiated the TiNivo trial in collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb, or BMS, which is providing nivolumab for the study. We are the study sponsor. The TiNivo trial is a phase 1/2 trial of tivozanib in combination with nivolumab, a PD-1 inhibitor, for the treatment of RCC, for which our costs, including tivozanib drug supply and distribution, could be in the range of $2.0 million to $2.5 million.\nAV-380 Program in Cachexia\nIn August 2015, we entered into a license agreement with Novartis, under which we granted Novartis the exclusive right to develop and commercialize AV-380 and related AVEO antibodies that bind to GDF15 worldwide. Under this agreement, Novartis is responsible for all activities and costs associated with the further development, regulatory filing and commercialization of AV-380 worldwide. We do not expect to incur any significant costs related to AV-380 in future periods beyond any milestone fees and royalties payable to St.Vincent's pursuant to our in-licensing agreement, which comprises substantially all of the costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAV-203\nIn March 2014, we regained our worldwide rights from Biogen Idec to develop, manufacture and commercialize AV-203. In March 2016, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with CANbridge, under which we granted CANbridge the exclusive right to develop and commercialize AV-203 in all countries other than the United States, Canada and Mexico. CANbridge is responsible for all costs of developing and commercializing AV-203 within its licensed territory. For a period of time following the completion of certain proof-of-concept clinical studies by CANbridge involving the use of AV-203 for the treatment of squamous cell esophagus cancer, we agreed to negotiate exclusively with CANbridge for (a) the right to co-develop ErbB3 inhibitory antibody products for the treatment of squamous cell esophagus cancer or (b) the right to include the United States, Canada and Mexico as part of the licensed territories. We do not expect to incur any significant costs related to AV-203 prior to CANbridge's completion of a proof-of-concept clinical study.\nFiclatuzumab\nIn April 2014, we entered into the Biodesix Agreement to develop and commercialize ficlatuzumab, our potent HGF inhibitory antibody. Pursuant to the agreement, Biodesix was to provide up to $15.0 million for the phase 2 FOCAL trial of ficlatuzumab in combination with erlotinib in first-line advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients selected using Biodesix's proprietary companion diagnostic VeriStrat. In connection with the discontinuation of the FOCAL trial, on October 14, 2016 we and Biodesix amended the Biodesix Agreement. Under the amendment, we agreed to fund 50% of the shutdown costs of the FOCAL trial after August 1, 2016. In return, we would be entitled to reimbursement at a multiple of such shutdown expenses out of any future revenues Biodesix receives from ficlatuzumab. All manufacturing and all non-FOCAL development, regulatory or commercial expenses for ficlatuzumab will continue to be equally shared, as provided in the original Biodesix Agreement. Due to the unpredictable nature of clinical development, we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur in the future development of ficlatuzumab.\nUncertainties of Estimates Related to Research and Development Expenses\nThe process of conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials necessary to obtain FDA approval for each of our product candidates is costly and time-consuming. The probability of success for each product candidate and clinical trial may be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the quality of the product candidate's early clinical data, investment in the program, competition, manufacturing capabilities and commercial viability.\nAt this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, specific timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of our product candidates, or the period, if any, in which material net cash inflows may commence from sales of any approved products. This uncertainty is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs, including the uncertainty of:\n \u2022 our ability to establish and maintain strategic partnerships, the terms of those strategic partnerships and the success of those strategic partnerships, if any, including the timing and amount of payments that we might receive from strategic partners; \n \u2022 the scope, progress, results and costs of preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for any product candidate; \n \u2022 the progress and results of our clinical trials; \n \u2022 the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates; \n \u2022 the emergence of competing technologies and products and other adverse market developments; and \n \u2022 the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property-related claims. \nAs a result of the uncertainties associated with developing drugs, including those discussed above, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of current or future clinical stages of our product candidates, or when, or to what extent, we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates. Development timelines, probability of success and development costs vary widely. We anticipate that we will make determinations as to which additional programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific and clinical success, if any, of each product candidate, as well as ongoing assessment of each product candidate's commercial potential. We will need to raise substantial additional capital in the future in order to fund the development of our preclinical and clinical product candidates.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and related costs for personnel in executive, finance, corporate development, information technology, legal and human resource functions. Other general and administrative expenses include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, patent filing, prosecution and defense costs and professional fees for legal, consulting, pre-commercialization activities, auditing and tax services. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses in 2017 will remain at current levels.\nWarrants Issued in Connection with Private Placement\nWe account for warrant instruments that either conditionally or unconditionally obligate the issuer to transfer assets as liabilities regardless of the timing of the redemption feature or price, even though the underlying shares may be classified as permanent or temporary equity. These warrants are subject to revaluation at each balance sheet date, and any changes in fair value are recorded as a non-cash component of other expense, until the earlier of their exercise or expiration or upon the completion of a liquidation event.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest income consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The primary objective of our investment policy is capital preservation. Interest expense consists of interest, amortization of debt discount, and amortization of deferred financing costs associated with our loans payable.\nIncome Taxes\nWe calculate our provision for income taxes on ordinary income based on our projected annual tax rate for the year. We recorded a loss for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, and since we maintain a full valuation allowance on all of our deferred tax assets, we have recorded no income tax provision or benefit during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, except for a $0.1 million provision recorded in the year ended December 31, 2016 related to withholding taxes incurred in a foreign jurisdiction.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, accrued clinical expenses, and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we and our management believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenues have historically been generated primarily through collaborative research, development and commercialization agreements. The terms of these agreements generally contain multiple elements, or deliverables, which may include (i) licenses, or options to obtain licenses, to our technology, (ii) research and development activities to be performed on behalf of the collaborative partner, and (iii) in certain cases, services in connection with the manufacturing of pre-clinical and clinical material. Payments to us under these arrangements typically include one or more of the following: non-refundable, upfront license fees; option exercise fees; funding of research and/or development efforts; milestone payments; and royalties on future product sales.\nWhen evaluating multiple element arrangements, we consider whether the deliverables under the arrangement represent separate units of accounting. This evaluation requires subjective determinations and requires management to make judgments about the individual deliverables and whether such deliverables are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship. In determining the units of accounting, management evaluates certain criteria, including whether the deliverables have standalone value, based on the relevant facts and circumstances for each arrangement. The consideration received is allocated among the separate units of accounting using the relative selling price method, and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units.\nWe determine the estimated selling price for deliverables within each agreement using vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of selling price, if available, third-party evidence, or TPE, of selling price if VSOE is not available, or best estimate of selling price if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. Determining the best estimate of selling price for a deliverable requires significant judgment. We typically use best estimates of selling price to estimate the selling price for licenses to our proprietary technology, since we often do not have VSOE or TPE of selling price for these deliverables. In those circumstances where we utilize the best estimate of selling price to determine the estimated selling price of a license to our proprietary technology, we consider market conditions as well as entity-specific factors, including those factors contemplated in negotiating the agreements and internally developed models that include assumptions related to the market opportunity, estimated development costs, probability of success and the time needed to commercialize a product candidate pursuant to the applicable license. In validating our best estimate of selling price, we evaluate whether changes in the key assumptions used to determine the best estimate of selling price will have a significant effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration among multiple deliverables.\nWe typically receive non-refundable, upfront payments when licensing our intellectual property in conjunction with a research and development agreement. When management believes the license to our intellectual property does not have stand-alone value from the other deliverables to be provided in the arrangement, we generally recognize revenue attributed to the license on a straight-line basis over our contractual or estimated performance period, which is typically the term of our research and development obligations. If management cannot reasonably estimate when our performance obligation ends, then revenue is deferred until management can\nreasonably estimate when the performance obligation ends. When management believes the license to our intellectual property has stand-alone value, we generally recognize revenue attributed to the license upon delivery. The periods over which revenue should be recognized are subject to estimates by management and may change over the course of the research and development agreement. Such a change could have a material impact on the amount of revenue we record in future periods.\nPayments or reimbursements resulting from our research and development efforts for those arrangements where such efforts are considered as deliverables are recognized as the services are performed and are presented on a gross basis so long as there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. Amounts received prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying balance sheets.\nAt the inception of each agreement that includes milestone payments, we evaluate whether each milestone is substantive and at risk to both parties on the basis of the contingent nature of the milestone. This evaluation includes an assessment of whether (a) the consideration is commensurate with either (1) the entity's performance to achieve the milestone, or (2) the enhancement of the value of the delivered item(s) as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the entity's performance to achieve the milestone, (b) the consideration relates solely to past performance, and (c) the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement. We evaluate factors such as the scientific, regulatory, commercial and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the respective milestone, the level of effort and investment required to achieve the respective milestone and whether the milestone consideration is reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement in making this assessment.\nWe aggregate our milestones into four categories: (i) clinical and development milestones, (ii) regulatory milestones, (iii) commercial milestones, and (iv) patent-related milestones. Clinical and development milestones are typically achieved when a product candidate advances into a defined phase of clinical research or completes such phase. For example, a milestone payment may be due to us upon the initiation of a phase 3 clinical trial for a new indication, which is the last phase of clinical development and could eventually contribute to marketing approval by the FDA or other global regulatory authorities. Regulatory milestones are typically achieved upon acceptance of the submission for marketing approval of a product candidate or upon approval to market the product candidate by the FDA or other global regulatory authorities. For example, a milestone payment may be due to us upon the FDA's acceptance of a New Drug Application, or NDA. Commercial milestones are typically achieved when an approved pharmaceutical product reaches certain defined levels of net sales by the licensee, such as when a product first achieves global sales or annual sales of a specified amount. Patent-related milestones are typically achieved when a patent application is filed or a patent is issued with respect to certain intellectual property related to the applicable collaboration.\nRevenues from clinical and development, regulatory, and patent-related milestone payments, if the milestones are deemed substantive and the milestone payments are nonrefundable, are recognized upon successful accomplishment of the milestones. We have concluded that the clinical and development, regulatory and patent-related milestones pursuant to our current research and development arrangements are substantive. Milestones that are not considered substantive are accounted for as license payments and recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining period of performance. Revenues from commercial milestone payments are accounted for as royalties and are recorded as revenue upon achievement of the milestone, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\nAccrued Expenses and Accrued Clinical Trial Costs and Contract Research Liabilities\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate accrued expenses. This process involves identifying services which have been performed on our behalf, and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements. Given our current business, the primary area of uncertainty concerning accruals which could have a material effect on our operating results is with respect to service fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of clinical drug supplies and to contract research organizations in connection with our clinical trials. In connection with all of the foregoing service fees, our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided. The majority of our service providers, including contract research organizations, invoice us in arrears for services performed. In the event that we do not identify some costs which have begun to be incurred, or we under or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services in a given period, our reported expenses for such period would be understated or overstated. We currently reflect the effects of any changes in estimates based on changes in facts and circumstances directly in our operations in the period such change becomes known.\nOur arrangements with contract research organizations in connection with clinical trials often provide for payment prior to commencing the project or based upon predetermined milestones throughout the period during which services are expected to be performed. We recognize expense relating to these arrangements based on the various services provided over the estimated time to completion. The date on which services commence, the level of services performed on or before a given date, and the cost of such services are often determined based on subjective judgments. We make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances\nknown to us based on the terms of the contract and our ongoing monitoring of service performance. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we had arrangements with multiple contract research organizations whereby these organizations commit to performing services for us over multiple reporting periods. We recognize the expenses associated with these arrangements based on our expectation of the timing of the performance of components under these arrangements by these organizations. Generally, these components consist of the costs of setting up the trial, monitoring the trial, closing the trial and preparing the resulting data. Costs related to patient enrollment in clinical trials are accrued as patients are enrolled in the trial.\nWith respect to financial reporting periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and based on our receipt of invoices from our third party providers, the timing of our actual costs incurred have not differed materially from our estimated timing of such costs. In light of the foregoing, we do not believe our practices for estimating future expenses and making judgments concerning the accrual of expenses are reasonably likely to change in the future.\nStock-Based Compensation\nUnder our stock-based compensation programs, we periodically grant stock options and restricted stock to employees, directors and nonemployee consultants. We also issue shares under an employee stock purchase plan. The fair value of all awards is recognized in our statements of operations over the requisite service period for each award.\nAwards that vest as the recipient provides service are expensed on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Other awards, such as performance-based awards that vest upon the achievement of specified goals, are expensed using the accelerated attribution method if achievement of the specified goals is considered probable. We have also granted awards that vest upon the achievement of market conditions. Per Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 718 Share-Based Payments, market conditions must be considered in determining the estimated grant-date fair value of share-based payments and the market conditions must be considered in determining the requisite service period over which compensation cost is recognized. We estimate the fair value of the awards with market conditions using a Monte Carlo simulation, which utilizes several assumptions including the risk-free interest rate, the volatility of our stock and the exercise behavior of award recipients. The grant-date fair value of the awards is then recognized over the requisite service period, which represents the derived service period for the awards as determined by the Monte Carlo simulation.\nWe use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value our stock option awards without market conditions, which requires us to make certain assumptions regarding the expected volatility of our common stock price, the expected term of the option grants, the risk-free interest rate and the dividend yield with respect to our common stock. In 2016, we began calculating volatility using our historical data. Previously, we did not have sufficient history to support a calculation of volatility using only our historical data. As such, prior to 2016, we used a weighted-average volatility considering our own volatility since March 2010 and the volatilities of several peer companies. For purposes of identifying similar entities, we considered characteristics such as industry, length of trading history, similar vesting terms and in-the-money option status. Due to a lack of our own historical data, we elected to use the simplified\u201d method for plain vanilla\u201d options to estimate the expected term of our stock option grants. Under this approach, the weighted-average expected life is presumed to be the average of the vesting term and the contractual term of the option. The risk-free interest rate used for each grant is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for instruments with a similar expected life. We utilize a dividend yield of zero based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and have no present intention to pay cash dividends.\nThe fair value of equity-classified awards to employees and directors are measured at fair value on the date the awards are granted. Awards to nonemployee consultants are recorded at their fair values and are re-measured as of each balance sheet date until the recipient's services are complete.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes pricing model for new grants were as follows:\nTable 287: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Volatility factor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 72.18% - 74.47%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 73.04% - 78.70%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 69.38% - 77.92%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected term (in years)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.00 - 6.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.50 - 6.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.50 - 6.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk-free interest rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.07% - 2.01%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.54% - 1.93%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.81% - 2.02%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dividend yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe recognized stock-based compensation expense of approximately $1.0 million, $1.1 million and $2.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. During the years ending December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we estimated our expected forfeiture rates to be 76%, 71% and 62%, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $0.8 million of\ntotal unrecognized stock-based compensation expense for stock options, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.5 years.\nWe record compensation expense only for those awards that we ultimately expect will vest. We have performed an historical analysis of option awards that were forfeited prior to vesting and recorded total stock option expense that reflected this estimated forfeiture rate. We cannot currently predict the total amount of stock-based compensation expense to be recognized in any future period because such amounts will depend on levels of stock-based payments granted in the future as well as the portion of the awards that actually vest. Forfeitures are estimated each period and adjusted if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Actual forfeitures may differ from our estimates as a result of significant changes in our operations.\nWe have historically granted stock options at exercise prices that are not less than the fair market value of our common stock.\nWarrants Issued in Connection with Private Placement\nWe account for warrant instruments that either conditionally or unconditionally obligate the issuer to transfer assets as liabilities regardless of the timing of the redemption feature or price, even though the underlying shares may be classified as permanent or temporary equity. In May 2016, we issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 17,642,482 shares of our common stock in connection with a private placement financing and recorded the warrants as a liability. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources-Private Placement/PIPE Warrants\u201d below. The fair value of these warrants has been determined using the Black-Scholes pricing model. These warrants are subject to revaluation at each balance sheet date, and any changes in fair value are recorded as a non-cash component of other income (expense), net in our Statements of Operations until the earlier of their exercise or expiration or upon the completion of a liquidation event.\nThe key assumptions used to value the PIPE Warrants were as follows:\nTable 288: <table> <tr>

2015 related to Novartis for the $15.0 million upfront payment received in connection with our licensing agreement entered into in August 2015 and $3.5 million for the purchase of our inventory of clinical material in the fourth quarter of 2015. This decrease was partially offset by the $1.0 million upfront payment received in connection with our collaboration and license agreement with CANbridge entered into in March 2016 and $0.8 million in the acceleration of deferred revenue that was recognized upon the effective termination of our licensing agreement with Pharmstandard in September 2016 that otherwise would have been recognized over the performance period through April 2022.\nIn 2015 as compared to 2014, revenue increased by $0.9 million principally due to the recognition of $18.5 million of revenue associated with the receipt of a $15.0 million upfront payment for our license of AV-380 to Novartis and Novartis' subsequent purchase of clinical material for $3.5 million. These amounts were partially offset by a decrease of $3.6 million of revenue from Astellas following the termination of our collaboration agreement in 2014 and a decrease of $14.3 million of revenue recognized from our arrangement with Biogen due to the one-time recognition of previously deferred revenue following an amendment to our agreement in 2014.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nTable 290: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2016 / 2015 Comparison\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2015 / 2014 Comparison\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tivozanib\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,530\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,017\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AV-380 Program in Cachexia\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,944\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (81\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10,560\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (81\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ficlatuzumab\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,579\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,499\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (95\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AV-203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (456\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (86\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,311\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (71\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other pipeline programs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (61\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (85\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (57\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (85\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Overhead\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,195\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (135\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10,874\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (89\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,703\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 38,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (25,379\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (66\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2016 as compared to 2015, research and development expenses increased by $10.8 million due to a $12.7 million increase in tivozanib, principally related to the advancement of the TIVO-3 trial that commenced patient enrollment and treatment in May 2016. This increase was partially offset by a $1.5 million decrease related to the upfront fee incurred under the amended St. Vincent's license agreement entered into in August 2015. We expect that research and development expenses in 2017 will remain at current levels as we seek to advance and complete enrollment in the TIVO-3 and TiNivo trials.\nIn 2015 as compared to 2014, research and development expenses decreased by $25.4 million principally attributable to a $7.8 million decrease in employee compensation, benefits, contract labor and consulting and a decrease of $9.2 million in facilities, IT, and other costs following our January 2015 restructuring; a decrease of $7.6 million in outsourced services costs primarily related to the completion of the manufacture of AV-380 material in 2014; and a decrease of $0.8 million in medical affairs and external clinical trial costs associated with the decreased number of active patients enrolled in our clinical trials.\nIncluded in research and development expenses were stock-based compensation expenses of approximately $0.3 million in each of 2016 and 2015, and $0.9 million in 2014.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nTable 291: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2016 / 2015 Comparison\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2015 / 2014 Comparison\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,205\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (6,012\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (42\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (4,372\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (24\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2016 as compared to 2015, general and administrative expenses decreased by $6.0 million, principally the result of a $4.8 million decrease in external costs associated with various ongoing legal matters, including $4.0 million related to the settlement of SEC claims and $0.8 million in legal fees, as well as a $0.7 million decrease in employee compensation following our decreased headcount and the reduction of our utilized facility space following our 2015 restructuring. In 2017, we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will remain at current levels.\nIn 2015 as compared to 2014, general and administrative expenses decreased by $4.4 million, principally the result of a $4.1 million decrease in salaries, benefits, contract labor and consulting and a decrease of $4.5 million in facilities, IT, insurance and other infrastructure costs following our January 2015 restructuring as well as a $2.0 million decrease in external legal costs associated with various ongoing legal matters. These amounts were partially offset by $4.0 million in expense incurred in 2015 related to the accrual of an estimated settlement liability, for accounting purposes, related to the SEC claims and an increase in depreciation expense of $2.2 million due to the acceleration of depreciation in connection with the termination of our lease agreement of 650 East Kendall Street in September 2014.\nIncluded in general and administrative expenses were stock-based compensation expenses of approximately $0.7 million, $0.8 million and $1.9 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nRestructuring and Lease Exit\nTable 292: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2016 / 2015 Comparison\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2015 / 2014 Comparison\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restructuring and lease exit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,729\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,358\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7,371\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (63\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2016 as compared to 2015, restructuring and lease exit expenses decreased by $4.4 million as a result of the January 2015 restructuring that was substantially completed in March 2015.

In 2017, we anticipate that interest expense will remain at current levels.\nIn 2015 as compared to 2014, interest expense, net decreased by $0.1 million principally attributable to the declining average outstanding balance on our loan with Hercules.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our non-cancellable contractual obligations at December 31, 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 295: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 to 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3 to 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hercules loan agreement (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,665\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Clinical trial costs and contract research (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 27,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,601\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 47,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Includes scheduled interest payments and end of term payments totaling $690,000 due at the time of the final payments of the outstanding principal in connection with the 2014 Amendment and 2016 Amendment under the Hercules loan agreement. \n (2) Clinical trial costs and contract research principally include contracts for human clinical trials and clinical drug distribution. In the event a contract is terminated prior to the planned completion, the amount paid under such contracts may be less than the amounts presented. \n (3) We sublease our principal office facility at One Broadway in Cambridge, MA. Our lease arrangement is cancellable within 30 days' notice to our landlord. As a result, our operating lease obligation as of December 31, 2016 is the January 2017 rent payable to our landlord \n (4) Under our license agreement with Kyowa Hakko Kirin, we are required to make certain milestone payments upon the achievement of specified regulatory milestones. We are also required to pay 30% of certain amounts we receive from sublicensees, including upfront license fees, milestone payments and royalties, other than amounts we receive in respect of research and development funding or equity investments, subject to certain limitations. Additionally, under our license agreement with St. Vincent's, we are required to make certain milestone payments upon the earlier of achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones or a specified date for the first indication, and upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones for the second and third indications. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate when or if we may be required to make other additional payments to Kyowa Hakko Kirin or St. Vincent's and have not included any additional amounts in the table above. \n (5) As discussed in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements, we have executed license agreements for patented technology and other technology related to research projects, including technology to humanize ficlatuzumab and other antibody product candidates. The license agreements required us to pay non-refundable license fees upon execution, and in certain cases, require milestone payments upon the achievement of defined development goals. We have not included any additional milestone payments in the table above as we are not able to make a reasonable estimate of the probability and timing of such payments, if any. In addition to the amounts in the table above, these four agreements include sales and development milestones of up to $22.5 million. $5.5 million and $4.2 million per product, respectively, and single digit royalties as a percentage. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have financed our operations to date primarily through the sale of private placements and public offerings of our common stock and preferred stock, license fees, milestone payments and research and development funding from strategic partners, and loan proceeds. In May 2016, we raised approximately $20.3 million in net cash proceeds, consisting of $15.4 million in net proceeds from a private placement of 17,642,842 units, each including one share of our common stock and a warrant to purchase one share of our common stock, and $4.9 million in net proceeds from additional borrowings under our Hercules loan agreement. As of December 31, 2016, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $23.3 million. See -Operating Capital Requirements and Going Concern\u201d below and Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of our liquidity and the conditions and events which raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. Currently, our funds are invested in a U.S. government money market fund, and corporate debt securities, including commercial paper. The following table sets forth the primary sources and uses of cash for each of the periods set forth below:\nTable 301: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (31,066\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (18,230\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (54,248\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (764\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,316\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 54,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,126\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (11,538\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (25,672\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,480\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur operating activities used cash of $31.1 million, $18.2 million and $54.2 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Cash used in operations was due principally to our net loss adjusted for non-cash items and changes in working capital.\nOur investing activities used cash of $0.8 million and $6.3 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, and provided $54.7 million in 2014. Cash used by investing activities in each of 2016 and 2015 was principally the net result of the purchase of marketable securities, partially offset by the maturities of marketable securities in each period and proceeds from the sale of equipment of $1.2 million in 2015. Cash provided by investing activities in 2014 was the net result of maturities of marketable securities, partially offset by the purchase of marketable securities and purchases of property and equipment of $12.9 million.\nOur financing activities provided cash of $20.3 million and $1.0 million in 2016 and 2014, respectively, and used cash of $1.1 million in 2015. In 2016, we raised approximately $20.3 million in net cash proceeds, consisting of $15.4 million in net proceeds from a private placement of 17,642,842 units, each including one share of our common stock and a warrant to purchase one share of our common stock, or the PIPE Warrants, and $4.9 million in net proceeds from additional borrowings under our Hercules loan agreement. In 2015, we raised approximately $10.5 million in net proceeds from the sale of our common stock, including $10.2 million under our at-the-market, or ATM, facility with FBR & Co., or FBR, (formerly MLV & Co. LLC), and $0.3 million from the issuance of stock for stock-based compensation arrangements, offset by $11.6 million in principal payments under our Hercules loan agreement. In 2014, we raised approximately $8.8 million in net cash proceeds, including $8.6 million in net proceeds from the additional borrowings under our Hercules loan agreement and $0.2 million from the issuance of stock for stock-based compensation arrangements offset by $7.8 million in principal payments on loans payable to Hercules.\nPrivate Placement / PIPE Warrants\nIn May 2016, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with a select group of qualified institutional buyers, institutional accredited investors and accredited investors pursuant to which we sold 17,642,482 units, at a price of $0.965 per unit, for gross proceeds of approximately $17.0 million. Each unit consisted of one share of our common stock and a warrant to purchase one share of our common stock, which we refer to as the PIPE Warrants. The PIPE Warrants have an exercise price of $1.00 per share and are exercisable in any manner at any time for a period of five years from the date of issuance. Certain of our directors and executive officers purchased an aggregate of 544,039 units in this offering at the same price as the other investors. The net offering proceeds to us were approximately $15.4 million after deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses payable by us.\nThe PIPE Warrants contain a provision giving the warrant holder the option to receive cash, equal to the fair value of the remaining unexercised portion of the warrant, as cash settlement in the event that there is a fundamental transaction (contractually defined to include various merger, acquisition or stock transfer activities). Due to this provision, ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity requires that these warrants be classified as a liability and not as equity. Accordingly, we recorded a warrant liability in the amount of approximately $9.3 million. The fair value of these warrants has been determined using the Black-Scholes pricing model and the changes in the fair value at the time of each reporting date are recorded in the Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded an approximate $4.8 million gain in fair value in the Statements of Operations that principally resulted from the lower stock price as of the December 31, 2016 reporting date. As of December 31, 2016, none of the PIPE Warrants have been exercised.\nAt-The-Market Issuance Sales Agreement with FBR\nIn February 2015, we entered into an at-the-market issuance sales agreement, which we refer to as the Sales Agreement, with FBR & Co., or FBR, (formerly MLV & Co. LLC), pursuant to which we could issue and sell shares of our common stock from time to time up to an aggregate amount of $17.9 million, at our option, through FBR as our sales agent. Sales of common stock through FBR may be made by any method that is deemed an at-the-market\u201d offering as defined in Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Sales Agreement, FBR will use commercially reasonable efforts to sell our common stock based upon our instructions (including any price, time or size limits or other customary parameters or conditions we may impose). We are not obligated to make any sales of common stock under the Sales Agreement. Any shares sold will be sold pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3. We are required to pay FBR a commission of up to 3% of the gross proceeds. The Sales Agreement may be terminated by us at any time.\nOn May 7, 2015, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, which we refer to as the 2015 Shelf. The 2015 Shelf covers the offering, issuance and sale of up to $100 million of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and/or units. The 2015 Shelf was filed to replace our then existing $250 million shelf registration statement, which expired at the end of May 2015, and which we refer to as the 2012 Shelf. On May 7, 2015, we also amended the Sales Agreement to provide for the offering, issuance and sale of up to $15.0 million of our common stock under the 2015 Shelf. The prior at-the-market offering initiated under the original Sales Agreement expired along with the 2012 Shelf. As of December 31, 2016, we have sold approximately 5.9 million shares pursuant to the Sales Agreement, as amended, resulting in proceeds of approximately $10.2 million, net of commissions and issuance costs. No shares have been sold during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nApproximately $9.1 million remains available for sale under the Sales Agreement.\nCredit Facilities\nOn May 28, 2010, we entered into a loan and security agreement, or the Loan Agreement, with Hercules. The Loan Agreement was subsequently amended in March 2012, or the 2012 Amendment; September 2014, or the 2014 Amendment; and May 2016, or the 2016 Amendment. Amounts borrowed under the 2012 Amendment were repaid in full in 2015.\nPursuant to the 2014 Amendment, we received additional loan proceeds from Hercules in the amount of $10.0 million and were not required to commence principal payments until May 1, 2016. An end-of-term payment of approximately $0.5 million continues to be due on January 1, 2018 or on such earlier date if the loan is prepaid.\nPursuant to the 2016 Amendment, we received additional loan proceeds from Hercules in the amount of $5.0 million, which increased the aggregate outstanding principal balance under the Loan Agreement to $15.0 million. We are not required to commence principal payments on the $15.0 million loan until July 1, 2017, at which time we will be required to make 30 equal monthly payments of principal and interest through December 2019. An end-of-term payment of approximately $0.2 million is due on December 1, 2019. The 2016 Amendment includes a financial covenant that requires us to maintain an unrestricted cash position greater than or equal to $10.0 million through the date of completion of our Phase 3 TIVO-3 trial. Refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion of the adverse consequences of failure to comply with the financial covenant.\nUnder the 2016 Amendment, from March 1, 2017 through June 30, 2017, we may draw down an additional $5.0 million in funding upon the satisfaction of the following conditions: (i) achieving developmental progression satisfactory to Hercules on a minimum of two (2) clinical programs (other than the Phase 3 TIVO-3 trial) that are either managed directly by us or funded, in whole or in part, by us and (ii) having an unrestricted cash position greater than or equal to $25.0 million on the date of the draw down request. If we draw down the additional $5.0 million in funding, the commencement of principal payments on the aggregate $20.0 million loan balance will be deferred by six months from July 1, 2017 until January 1, 2018.\nWe must make interest payments on the principal balance of the loan each month it remains outstanding. Per annum interest is payable on the loan balance at the greater of 11.9% and an amount equal to 11.9% plus the prime rate minus 4.75%, as determined daily, provided however, that the per annum interest rate shall not exceed 15.0%. Our annual interest rate as of December 31, 2016 was 11.9%.\nWe have determined that the risk of subjective acceleration under the material adverse events clause included in this loan and security agreement is remote and, therefore, have classified the outstanding principal amount in current and long-term liabilities based on the timing of scheduled principal payments. As of December 31, 2016, we are in compliance with all of the financial covenants and, through the date of this filing, the lenders have not asserted any events of default under the loan. We do not believe that there has been a material adverse change as defined in the loan agreement.\nThe loans are secured by a lien on all of our personal property (other than intellectual property), whether owned as of, or acquired after, the date of the Loan Agreement.\nOperating Capital Requirements and Going Concern\nWe have devoted substantially all of our resources to our drug development efforts, comprised of research and development, manufacturing, conducting clinical trials for our product candidates, protecting our intellectual property and general and administrative functions relating to these operations. Our future success is dependent on our ability to develop our product candidates and ultimately upon our ability to attain profitable operations. As of December 31, 2016, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling approximately $23.3 million, working capital of $16.0 million and an accumulated deficit of $521.9 million.\nWe anticipate that we will continue to incur significant operating losses for the next several years as we incur expenses to continue to execute on our clinical development strategy to advance our clinical stage assets. We will require substantial additional funds to continue our development programs and to fulfill our planned operating goals. In particular, our currently planned operating and capital requirements include the need for substantial working capital to support our development activities for tivozanib. For example, we estimate that the remaining costs for the TIVO-3 trial for RCC, including drug supply and distribution, could be in the range of $22.0 million to $25.0 million in the aggregate through 2018. We have also initiated the TiNivo trial in collaboration with BMS, which is providing nivolumab for the study. We are the study sponsor. The TiNivo trial is a phase 1/2 study of tivozanib combined with nivolumab, a PD-1 inhibitor, for the treatment of patients with RCC for which our costs, including tivozanib drug supply and distribution, could be in the range of $2.0 million to $2.5 million through 2018. Moreover, we have future payment obligations and cost-sharing arrangements under certain of our collaboration and license agreements. For example, under our agreements with KHK and St. Vincent's, we are required to make certain clinical and regulatory milestone payments, have royalty obligations with respect to product sales and are required to pay a specified percentage of sublicense revenue in certain instances.\nWe are subject to a number of risks, including the need for substantial additional capital for clinical research and product development and the risk that we are unable to maintain compliance with our financial covenant pursuant to our Loan Agreement with Hercules, which requires us to maintain unrestricted cash (defined as cash and liquid cash, including marketable securities) greater\nthan or equal to $10.0 million through the date of completion of our Phase 3 TIVO-3 trial. Non-compliance with the financial covenant would be considered an event of default that could result in Hercules, at its option, accelerating and demanding payment of all outstanding obligations together with a prepayment charge. Refer to Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further description of our Loan Agreement.\nBased upon our approximate $23.3 million in existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2016, we do not have sufficient cash on hand to support operations and maintain compliance with the $10.0 million financial covenant under our Loan Agreement with Hercules for at least the next twelve months from the date of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur plans to address these conditions include pursuing one or more of the following steps to raise additional funding, none of which can be guaranteed or are entirely within our control:\n \u2022 Raise funding through the possible sales of our common stock, including public or private equity financings. \n \u2022 Raise funding of up to $9.1 million through possible sales of our common stock under our Sales Agreement with FBR. \n \u2022 Satisfy the conditions that are set forth in our Loan Agreement with Hercules that would enable us to draw down an additional $5.0 million in funding under the Loan Agreement, as further described in -Credit Facilities\u201d above. If we draw down the additional $5.0 million in funding, the commencement of principal payments on the aggregate $20.0 million loan balance will be deferred by six months from July 1, 2017 until January 1, 2018. \n \u2022 Continue to seek a partner to advance development of the AV-353 platform for the potential treatment of PAH. \n \u2022 Earn milestone payments pursuant to collaboration and license agreements or restructure / monetize existing potential milestone and/or royalty payments under those collaboration and license agreements. \nThere can be no assurance, however, that we will receive cash proceeds from any of these potential resources or, to the extent cash proceeds are received, those proceeds would be sufficient to support our operations and allow us to maintain compliance with our financial covenant for at least the next twelve months from the date of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have concluded the likelihood that our plan to obtain sufficient funding from one or more of these sources will be successful, while reasonably possible, is less than probable. Accordingly, we have concluded that substantial doubt exists regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe believe that our approximate $23.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2016 could allow us to fund our planned operations into the fourth quarter of 2017. This estimate assumes no receipt of milestone payments from our partners or related payment of potential licensing milestones to third parties, no additional funding from new partnership agreements, no equity financings, no debt financings, no accelerated repayment of our term loan and no further sales of equity under our Sales Agreement with FBR. Accordingly, the timing and nature of activities contemplated for 2017 and thereafter will be conducted subject to the availability of sufficient financial resources.\nThere are numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products. Accordingly, our future funding requirements may vary from our current expectations and will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n \u2022 our ability to establish and maintain strategic partnerships, licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of such agreements; \n \u2022 the number and characteristics of the product candidates we pursue; \n \u2022 the scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing our product candidates, and of conducting preclinical and clinical trials; \n \u2022 the timing of, and the costs involved in, obtaining regulatory approvals for our product candidates; \n \u2022 the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims, including litigation costs and the outcome of such litigation; \n \u2022 the absence of any breach, acceleration event or event of default under our loan agreement with Hercules or under any other agreements with third parties; \n \u2022 the outcome of legal actions against us, including the current lawsuits described in Part I, Item 3 of this report under the heading Legal Proceedings\u201d; \n \u2022 the cost of commercialization activities if any of our product candidates are approved for sale, including marketing, sales and distribution costs; \n \u2022 the cost of manufacturing our product candidates and any products we successfully commercialize; \n \u2022 the timing, receipt and amount of sales of, or royalties on, our future products, if any; and \n \u2022 our ability to continue as a going concern. \nWe will require additional funding to extend our planned operations into 2018 and maintain compliance with our financial covenant under our Loan Agreement with Hercules. We may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities or preferred stock or through additional credit facilities, these securities and/or the loans under credit facilities could provide for rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. Additional funds may not be available when we need them, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. We also expect to seek additional funds through arrangements with collaborators, licensees or other third parties. These arrangements would generally require us to relinquish or encumber rights to some of our technologies or drug candidates, and we may not be able to enter into such arrangements on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to raise substantial additional capital in the near term, whether on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all then we may trigger an event of default under our Loan Agreement with Hercules and we may be required to:\n \u2022 delay, limit, reduce or terminate our clinical trials or other development activities for one or more of our product candidates; and/or \n \u2022 delay, limit, reduce or terminate our establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities that may be necessary to commercialize our product candidates, if approved. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have, during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under applicable SEC rules.\nTable 320: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read the Risk Factors\u201d section in Part 1 - Item 1A of this report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to advancing a broad portfolio of targeted therapeutics for oncology and other areas of unmet medical need. Our proprietary platform has delivered unique insights into cancer and related diseases. Our strategy is to leverage these biomarker insights and partner resources to advance the development of our clinical pipeline.\nOur pipeline includes our lead candidate tivozanib, an oral, once-daily, vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor, or TKI. Tivozanib is a potent, selective and long half-life inhibitor of all three VEGF receptors and is designed to optimize VEGF blockade while minimizing off-target toxicities, potentially resulting in improved efficacy and minimal dose modifications. Tivozanib has been investigated in several tumor types, including renal cell, colorectal and breast cancers.\nIn June 2013, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, issued a complete response letter denying our application for approval of the use of tivozanib in first-line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma, or RCC, citing concerns regarding the negative trend in overall survival in TIVO-1, our first pivotal phase 3 clinical trial.\nIn May 2016, we initiated enrollment and treatment of patients in TIVO-3, a new phase 3 clinical trial of tivozanib, in the third-line treatment of patients with refractory RCC seeking to address the overall survival, or OS, concerns from the TIVO-1 trial presented in the June 2013 complete response letter from the FDA and to support a request for regulatory approval of tivozanib in the United States as a third-line treatment and as a first-line treatment for RCC. We expect to complete enrollment in the TIVO-3 trial in June 2017, and to report top line data in the first quarter of 2018. The TIVO-3 trial passed an initial safety data assessment in February 2017. We expect a pre-planned interim futility analysis to occur mid-year 2017.\nIn March 2017, we initiated enrollment in the TiNivo trial, a phase 1/2 trial of tivozanib in combination with Opdivo\u00ae, or nivolumab, an immune checkpoint, or PD-1, inhibitor, for the treatment of RCC. Bristol-Myers Squibb is supplying nivolumab for the TiNivo trial, and we are the trial sponsor. The TiNivo trial is being led by the Institut Gustave Roussy in Paris under the direction of Professor Bernard Escudier, MD, Chairman of the Genitourinary Oncology Committee. The phase 1 trial will primarily evaluate the safety of tivozanib in combination with nivolumab at escalating doses of tivozanib and, assuming favorable results, is expected to be followed by a phase 2 expansion at the established combination dose. We expect to receive initial data from the phase 1 portion of the TiNivo trial in the first half of 2017.\nIn February 2016, EUSA Pharma (UK) Ltd., or EUSA, our European licensee, submitted a marketing authorization application, or MAA, for tivozanib with the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, for the treatment of RCC. The application was validated in March 2016, confirming that the submission was complete and that the EMA would initiate its review process. EUSA received the Day 120 List of Questions from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the EMA in July 2016, and submitted its responses in November 2016. In January 2017, EUSA received the Day 180 List of Outstanding Issues, or LOI, from the CHMP, of the EMA. The Day 180 LOI signifies that the MAA is not approvable at the present time, and outlines outstanding deficiencies, which are then required to be satisfactorily addressed in an oral explanation and/or in writing prior to a final application decision. EUSA has informed AVEO that it expects to submit written responses to the Day 180 LOI in April 2017, and the EMA has tentatively scheduled EUSA to provide an oral explanation to the CHMP in May 2017.\nWe also have a pipeline of monoclonal antibodies, including:\n (i) Ficlatuzumab, a potent hepatocyte growth factor, or HGF, antibody that inhibits the activity of the HGF/c-Met pathway. Ficlatuzumab is in early stage clinical development, with ongoing studies in acute myloid leukemia, or AML, and squamous cell cancer of the head and neck, or SCCHN. We and our worldwide partner Biodesix, Inc., or Biodesix, will share equally in all future costs and profits relating to the development of ficlatuzumab; \n (ii) AV-203, a potent, high-affinity inhibitor of the ErbB3 pathway. Our partner CANbridge Life Sciences Ltd., or CANbridge, will fund manufacturing and clinical development through proof-of-concept in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; \n (iii) AV-380, a potent, humanized IgG1 inhibitory monoclonal antibody targeting growth differentiating factor-15, or GDF15, a divergent member of the TGF-\u00df family, for the potential treatment or prevention of cachexia. We have licensed AV-380 to Novartis, which will fund all development, manufacturing and commercialization; and \n (iv) The AV-353 platform, a family of potent inhibitory antibody candidates specific to Notch 3, one of which has demonstrated an ability in preclinical models to potentially reverse disease phenotype for pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH. We are currently seeking a partner to advance development of the AV-353 platform for the potential treatment of PAH. \nGoing Concern\nWe have identified conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. To continue as a going concern, we must secure additional capital to provide us with additional liquidity. We believe that our approximate $23.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2016, could allow us to fund our planned operations into the fourth quarter of 2017; however, additional funds will be needed to extend these operations into 2018 and maintain compliance with our $10.0 million financial covenant under our loan agreement with Hercules Technology II, L.P. and Hercules Technology III, L.P., affiliates of Hercules Technology Growth, which we collectively refer to as Hercules. We expect that, in order to obtain additional capital, we will need to complete public or private financings of debt or equity, and / or receive milestone payments from our partners. We may also seek to procure additional funds through future arrangements with collaborators, licensees or other third parties, and these arrangements would generally require us to relinquish or encumber rights to some of our technologies or drug candidates. Moreover, we may not be able receive milestone payments or complete additional financing or enter into such arrangements on acceptable terms, if at all. For more information, refer to -Liquidity and Capital Resources-Operating Capital Requirements and Going Concern\u201d below and Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nStrategic Partnerships\nCANbridge\nIn March 2016, which we refer to as the Effective Date, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with CANbridge, or the CANbridge Agreement, under which we granted CANbridge the exclusive right to develop, manufacture and commercialize AV-203, our proprietary ErbB3 (HER3) inhibitory antibody, for the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease in humans and animals in all countries other than the United States, Canada and Mexico. Under the terms of the CANbridge Agreement, if we determine to grant a license to any ErbB3 inhibitory antibody in the United States, Canada or Mexico, we are obligated to first negotiate with CANbridge for the grant to CANbridge of a license to such rights. The parties have both agreed not to directly or indirectly develop or commercialize any other ErbB3 inhibitory antibody product during the term of the CANbridge Agreement other than pursuant to the CANbridge Agreement.\nCANbridge has responsibility for all activities and costs associated with the further development, manufacture, regulatory filings and commercialization of AV-203 throughout its licensed territory. CANbridge is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and obtain regulatory approval for AV-203 in each of China, Japan, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Spain, and Germany. CANbridge will bear all costs for development of AV-203 through proof-of-concept in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, after which we would expect to contribute to certain worldwide development costs.\nPursuant to the CANbridge Agreement, CANbridge paid us an upfront fee of $1.0 million in April 2016. CANbridge also agreed to reimburse us $1.0 million for certain manufacturing costs and expenses that we previously incurred, $0.5 million of which will be due on the earlier of (i) the date of validation by CANbridge of certain manufacturing development activities we conducted and (ii) twelve months from the Effective Date, and the remaining $0.5 million of which will be due on the earlier of (i) the date of validation by CANbridge of such manufacturing development activities or (ii) eighteen months from the Effective Date. We are also eligible to receive up to $42.0 million in potential development and regulatory milestone payments and up to $90.0 million in potential sales based milestone payments based on annual net sales of licensed products. Upon commercialization, we are eligible to receive a tiered royalty, with a percentage range in the low double-digits, on net sales of approved licensed products. CANbridge's obligation to pay royalties for each licensed product expires on a country-by-country basis on the later of the expiration of patent rights covering such licensed product in such country, the expiration of regulatory data exclusivity in such country and ten years after the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country. A percentage of any milestone and royalty payments received by us, excluding upfront and reimbursement payments, are due to Biogen Idec International GmbH, or Biogen Idec, as a sublicensing fee under our option and license agreement with Biogen dated March 18, 2009, as amended.\nEUSA\nIn December 2015, we entered into a license agreement with EUSA under which we granted to EUSA the exclusive, sublicensable right to develop, manufacture and commercialize tivozanib in the territories of Europe (excluding Russia, Ukraine and the Commonwealth of Independent States), Latin America (excluding Mexico), Africa, Australasia and New Zealand for all diseases and conditions in humans, excluding non-oncologic diseases or conditions of the eye. EUSA is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to seek regulatory approval for and commercialize tivozanib throughout its licensed territories in RCC. With the exception of certain support to be provided by us in connection with the application for marketing approval by the EMA, EUSA has responsibility for all activities and costs associated with the further development, manufacture, regulatory filings and commercialization of tivozanib in its licensed territories.\nUnder the license agreement, EUSA made a research and development funding payment to us of $2.5 million in 2015. EUSA is required to make a further research and development funding payment of $4.0 million if the EMA grants marketing approval for tivozanib for treatment of RCC. We are eligible to receive additional research funding from EUSA, including up to $20.0 million for the data generated by our phase 3 clinical trial in third-line RCC if EUSA elects to utilize such data for regulatory or commercial purposes, and up to $2.0 million for the data generated by a phase 1 combination trial with a checkpoint inhibitor if EUSA elects to utilize such data for regulatory or commercial purposes. We would be entitled to receive milestone payments of $2.0 million per country upon reimbursement approval, if any, for RCC in each of France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, and an additional $2.0 million for the grant of marketing approval, if any, in three of the following five countries: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, South Africa and Venezuela. We are also eligible to receive a payment of $2.0 million in connection with a filing by EUSA with the EMA for marketing approval, if any, for tivozanib for the treatment of each of up to three additional indications and $5.0 million per indication in connection with the EMA's grant of marketing approval for each of up to three additional indications, as well as up to $335.0 million upon EUSA's achievement of certain sales thresholds. We are also eligible to receive tiered double digit royalties on net sales, if any, of licensed products in its licensed territories ranging from a low double digit up to mid-twenty percent depending on the level of annual net sales. Thirty percent of any non-research and development related milestone and royalty payments we receive is due to Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd. (formerly Kirin Brewery Co. Ltd.), or KHK as a sublicensing fee under our license agreement with KHK. The research and development funding payments under the EUSA license agreement are not subject to sublicensing payment to KHK.\nNovartis\nIn August 2015, we entered into a license agreement with Novartis International Pharmaceutical Ltd., or Novartis, under which we granted Novartis the exclusive right to develop and commercialize AV-380 and our related antibodies that bind to GDF15 worldwide. Under this agreement, Novartis is responsible for all activities and costs associated with the further development, regulatory filing and commercialization of AV-380 worldwide.\nNovartis made an upfront payment to us of $15.0 million in September 2015. We are also eligible to receive (a) up to $53.0 million in potential clinical milestone payments and up to $105.0 million in potential regulatory milestone payments tied to the commencement of clinical trials and to regulatory approvals of products developed under the license agreement in the United States, the European Union and Japan; and (b) up to $150.0 million in potential sales based milestone payments based on annual net sales of such products. Upon commercialization, we are eligible to receive tiered royalties on net sales of approved products ranging from the high single digits to the low double-digits. Novartis has responsibility under the license agreement for the development, manufacture and commercialization of the licensed antibodies and any resulting approved therapeutic products. In December 2015, Novartis also exercised its right under the license agreement to acquire our inventory of clinical quality drug substance, reimbursing us approximately $3.5 million for such existing inventory.\nCertain milestones achieved by Novartis would trigger milestone payment obligations from us to St. Vincent's Hospital Sydney Limited, which we refer to as St. Vincent's, under our amended and restated license agreement with St. Vincent's. In addition, royalties on approved products, if any, will be payable to St. Vincent's, and we and Novartis will share that obligation equally.\nPharmstandard\nIn August 2015, we entered into a license agreement with JSC Pharmstandard-Ufimskiy Vitamin Plant,\u201d or Pharmstandard, a company registered under the laws of the Russian Federation. Pharmstandard is a subsidiary of Pharmstandard OJSC. Under the license agreement, we granted to Pharmstandard the exclusive, sublicensable right to develop, manufacture and commercialize tivozanib in the territories of Russia, Ukraine and the Commonwealth of Independent States, for all diseases and conditions in humans, excluding non-oncologic ocular conditions.\nIn June 2016, following unsuccessful efforts to renegotiate certain terms of the Pharmstandard license agreement, Pharmstandard notified us that due to economic and market changes in Russia it was exercising its right to terminate the license\nagreement effective September 9, 2016. Upon termination of the license agreement, the licenses to tivozanib granted to Pharmstandard were terminated, all product rights and regulatory documents were transferred to us, and Pharmstandard is no longer responsible for the development and commercialization of tivozanib in its licensed territories. Pharmstandard filed an application for marketing authorization in Russia for tivozanib for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma that was accepted by the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation in February 2016. This application was withdrawn following Pharmstandard's termination notice.\nOphthotech\nIn November 2014, we entered into a research and exclusive option agreement with Ophthotech Corporation, or Ophthotech, pursuant to which we provided Ophthotech an exclusive option to enter into a definitive license agreement whereby we would grant Ophthotech the right to develop and commercialize tivozanib outside of Asia and the Middle East for the potential diagnosis, prevention and treatment of non-oncologic diseases or conditions of the eye in humans. Pursuant to this option agreement, we granted to Ophthotech an exclusive, royalty-free license or sublicense, as applicable, under intellectual property rights controlled by us solely to perform the research and development activities related to the use of tivozanib for the specific purposes outlined in the agreement during the option period. These activities included formulation work for ocular administration, preclinical research and the conduct of a phase 1/2a proof-of-concept clinical trial of a product containing tivozanib in patients with wet age-related macular degeneration. Ophthotech paid us $0.5 million in consideration for the grant of the option. Such amount is non-refundable and not creditable against any other amounts due under the agreement.\nIn January 2017, Ophthotech notified us that it will not be able to develop tivozanib and exercised its right to terminate the option agreement effective April 3, 2017.\nBiodesix\nIn April 2014, we and Biodesix entered into the Biodesix Agreement to develop and commercialize ficlatuzumab. Under the Biodesix Agreement, we granted Biodesix perpetual, non-exclusive rights to certain intellectual property, including all clinical and biomarker data related to ficlatuzumab, to develop and commercialize VeriStrat\u00ae, Biodesix's proprietary companion diagnostic test. Biodesix granted us perpetual, non-exclusive rights to certain intellectual property, including diagnostic data related to VeriStrat, with respect to the development and commercialization of ficlatuzumab; each license includes the right to sublicense, subject to certain exceptions. Pursuant to a joint development plan, we retain primary responsibility for clinical development of ficlatuzumab. In September 2016, we and Biodesix announced the termination of the FOCAL trial, a phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical study of ficlatuzumab in which VeriStrat was used to select clinical trial subjects.\nUnder the Biodesix Agreement, with the exception of the costs incurred for the FOCAL trial, we and Biodesix are each required to contribute 50% of all clinical, regulatory, manufacturing and other costs to develop ficlatuzumab. Pursuant to the Biodesix Agreement, Biodesix was obligated to fund all costs of the FOCAL trial up to a cap of $15 million, following which all costs of the FOCAL trial would be shared equally. In connection with the discontinuation of the FOCAL trial, on October 14, 2016, we and Biodesix amended the Biodesix Agreement. Under the amendment, we agreed to share 50% of all program costs from August 1, 2016 forward. In return for bearing 50% of the FOCAL closeout costs after August 1, 2016, we will be entitled to recover an agreed multiple of the additional costs borne by us out of any income Biodesix receives from the partnership in connection with the licensing, development or commercialization of ficlatuzumab. We do not anticipate that these remaining costs will be material. Following such recovery, the payment structure under the original Biodesix Agreement, which generally provides that the parties share equally in any costs and revenue, will resume without such modification.\nPending marketing approval or the sublicense of ficlatuzumab, and subject to the negotiation of a commercialization agreement, each party would share equally in commercialization profits and losses, subject to our right to be the lead commercialization party.\nSt. Vincent's Hospital\nIn July 2012, we entered into a license agreement with St. Vincent's, under which we obtained an exclusive, worldwide license to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize products for therapeutic applications that benefit from inhibition or decreased expression or activity of MIC-1, which is also known as GDF15. We believe GDF15 is a novel target for cachexia, and we are exploiting this license in our AV-380 program for cachexia. Under the agreement, we have the right to grant sublicenses subject to certain restrictions. We have a right of first negotiation to obtain an exclusive license to certain improvements that St. Vincent's or third parties may make to licensed therapeutic products. Under the license agreement, St. Vincent's also granted us non-exclusive rights for certain related diagnostic products and research tools.\nIn connection with entering into the original license agreement with St. Vincent's in July 2012, we paid St. Vincent's an upfront license fee of $0.7 million and a low five-figure amount to reimburse St. Vincent's for patent-related expenses it incurred with respect to a specified licensed patent.\nIn August 2015, in connection with the execution of our license agreement with Novartis, we entered into an amended and restated agreement with St. Vincent's, pursuant to which we made an upfront payment to St. Vincent's of $1.5 million. Under our license agreement with St. Vincent's:\n \u2022 We (or any sublicensee) are obligated to use diligent efforts to conduct research and clinical development and commercially launch at least one licensed therapeutic product, and to maximize profits from licensed therapeutic products for the benefit of us and St. Vincent's. Subject to certain conditions, we have also agreed to achieve specified research, development and regulatory milestones by specified dates. If we (or a sublicensee) do not achieve a given milestone by the agreed date, we have the option of paying the amount we would have been obligated to pay had we timely achieved the milestone, and, if we do so, St. Vincent's will not have the right to terminate the license agreement based on our failure to timely achieve such milestone. \n \u2022 We have agreed that, for as long as there is a valid claim in the licensed patents, we will not, and we will ensure that our affiliates and our sublicensees do not, develop or commercialize any product, other than a licensed therapeutic product, for the treatment, prevention or prophylaxis of cachexia, decreased appetite or body weight, that binds to GDF15 or the GDF15 receptor and that is a GDF15 antagonist, and will not license or induce any other person to do the same. \n \u2022 We (or any sublicensee) are required to make milestone payments, up to an aggregate total of $18.9 million, upon the earlier of achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones or a specified date for the first indication, and upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones for the second and third indications, for licensed therapeutic products, some of which payments may be increased by a mid to high double-digit percentage rate for milestones payments made after we grant any sublicense under the license agreement, depending on the sublicensed territory or territories; \n \u2022 We (or any sublicensee) will be required to pay tiered royalty payments equal to a low-single-digit percentage of any net sales we or our sublicensees make from licensed therapeutic products, an obligation we share with Novartis equally. The royalty rate escalates within the low-single-digit range during each calendar year based on increasing licensed therapeutic product sales during such calendar year. Our royalty payment obligations for a licensed therapeutic product in a particular country end on the later of 10 years after the date of first commercial sale of such licensed therapeutic product in such country or expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim of the licensed patents covering such licensed therapeutic product in such country, and are subject to offsets under certain circumstances; and \n \u2022 We (or any sublicensee) will be required to reimburse St. Vincent's for some or all of the reasonable costs and expenses it incurs in patent management, filing, prosecuting and maintaining the licensed patents. \nAstellas Pharma\nIn February 2011, we and our wholly-owned subsidiary AVEO Pharma Limited entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Astellas Pharma Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries pursuant to which we and Astellas intended to develop and commercialize tivozanib for the treatment of a broad range of cancers. Astellas elected to terminate the agreement effective August 2014, at which time the tivozanib rights were returned to us. In accordance with the Astellas Agreement, committed development costs, including the costs of completing certain tivozanib clinical development activities, continue to be shared equally.\nBiogen Idec\nIn March 2009, we entered into an exclusive option and license agreement with Biogen Idec regarding the development and commercialization of our discovery-stage ErbB3-targeted antibodies for the potential treatment and diagnosis of cancer and other diseases in humans outside of North America. In March 2014, we amended our agreement with Biogen Idec, and regained worldwide rights to AV-203. Pursuant to the amendment, we were obligated to in good faith use reasonable efforts to seek a collaboration partner to fund further development and commercialization of ErbB3-targeted antibodies. We satisfied this obligation in March 2016 upon entering into our license agreement with CANbridge. We are obligated to pay Biogen Idec a percentage of milestone payments we receive under the CANbridge agreement and single-digit royalty payments on net sales related to the sale of AV-203, up to cumulative maximum amount of $50.0 million.\nKyowa Hakko Kirin\nIn December 2006, we entered into a license agreement with KHK under which we obtained an exclusive license, with the right to grant sublicenses subject to certain restrictions, to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize tivozanib, pharmaceutical\ncompositions thereof and associated biomarkers. Our exclusive license covers all territories in the world except for Asia and the Middle East, where KHK has retained the rights to tivozanib. Under the license agreement, we obtained exclusive rights in our territory under certain KHK patents, patent applications and know-how related to tivozanib, to research, develop, make, have made, use, import, offer for sale, and sell tivozanib for the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of any and all human diseases and conditions. We and KHK each have access to and can benefit from the other party's clinical data and regulatory filings with respect to tivozanib and biomarkers identified in the conduct of activities under the license agreement.\nUnder the license agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize tivozanib in our territory, including meeting certain specified diligence goals. Prior to the first anniversary of the first post-marketing approval sale of tivozanib in our territory, neither we nor any of our subsidiaries has the right to conduct certain clinical trials of, seek marketing approval for or commercialize any other cancer product that also works by inhibiting the activity of a VEGF receptor.\nWe have upfront, milestone and royalty payment obligations to KHK under our license agreement. Upon entering into the license agreement with KHK, we made an upfront payment in the amount of $5.0 million. In March 2010, we made a milestone payment to KHK in the amount of $10.0 million in connection with the dosing of the first patient in our first phase 3 clinical trial of tivozanib (TIVO-1). In December 2012, we made a $12.0 million milestone payment to KHK in connection with the acceptance by the FDA of our 2012 new drug application, or NDA filing for tivozanib. Each milestone under the KHK agreement is a one-time only payment obligation. Accordingly, we did not owe KHK another milestone payment in connection with the dosing of the first patient in our TIVO-3 trial, and would not owe a milestone payment to KHK if we file an NDA with the FDA following the completion of our TIVO-3 clinical trial. If we obtain approval for tivozanib in the U.S., we would owe KHK a one-time milestone payment of $18.0 million, provided that we do not sublicense U.S. rights for tivozanib prior to obtaining a U.S. regulatory approval. If we were to sublicense the U.S. rights, the associated U.S. regulatory milestone would be replaced by a specified percentage of sublicensing revenue, as set forth below.\nIf we sublicense any of our rights to tivozanib to a third party, as we have done with EUSA pursuant to our license agreement, the sublicense defines the payment obligations of the sublicensee, which may vary from the milestone and royalty payment obligations under our KHK license relating to rights we retain. We are required to pay KHK a fixed 30% of amounts we receive from our sublicensees, including upfront license fees, milestone payments and royalties, but excluding amounts we receive in respect of research and development funding or equity investments, subject to certain limitations. In accordance with the sublicensing provisions of our KHK agreement, in 2011 we made a $22.5 million payment to KHK related to the upfront license payment received under a collaboration and license agreement we entered into with Astellas Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the termination of which became effective on August 11, 2014. If tivozanib is approved in the European Union, or EU, the $4.0 million research and development reimbursement milestone that would be owed to us by EUSA would not be subject to a sublicense revenue payment to KHK, nor would a research and development reimbursement payment upon an election by EUSA to use the data generated from our TIVO-3 or TiNivo trials for regulatory or commercial purposes, which could be up to $20.0 million for the TIVO-3 data and up to $2.0 million TiNivo data. We would, however, owe KHK 30% of other, non-research and development payments we may receive from EUSA pursuant to our license agreement, including EU reimbursement approval milestones in up to five specified EU countries, EU marketing approvals for up to three additional indications beyond RCC, marketing approvals in up to three specified licensed territories outside of the EU, sales-based milestones and royalties, as set forth above.\nWe are also required to pay tiered royalty payments on net sales we make of tivozanib in our territory, which range from the low to mid-teens as a percentage of net sales. The royalty rate escalates within this range based on increasing tivozanib sales. Our royalty payment obligations in a particular country in our territory begin on the date of the first commercial sale of tivozanib in that country, and end on the later of 12 years after the date of first commercial sale of tivozanib in that country or the date of the last to expire of the patents covering tivozanib that have been issued in that country.\nThe license agreement will remain in effect until the expiration of all of our royalty and sublicense revenue obligations to KHK, determined on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, unless we elect to terminate the license agreement earlier. If we fail to meet our obligations under the agreement and are unable to cure such failure within specified time periods, KHK can terminate the agreement, resulting in a loss of our rights to tivozanib and an obligation to assign or license to KHK any intellectual property or other rights we may have in tivozanib, including our regulatory filings, regulatory approvals, patents and trademarks for tivozanib.\nFinancial Overview\nWe do not have a history of being profitable and, as of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $521.9 million. We anticipate that we will continue to incur significant operating costs over the next several years as we continue our planned development activities for our preclinical and clinical products. We will need additional funding to support our operating activities, and the timing and nature of activities contemplated for 2017 and thereafter will be conducted subject to the availability of sufficient financial resources. Refer to the -Going Concern\u201d and Liquidity and Capital Resources-Operating Capital Requirements and Going Concern\u201d sections for a further discussion of our funding requirements.\nRevenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales. All of our revenue to date has been derived from license fees, milestone payments, premium over the fair value of convertible preferred shares sold to our strategic partners, and research and development payments received from our strategic partners.\nIn the future, we may generate revenue from a combination of product sales, license fees, milestone payments and research and development payments in connection with strategic partnerships, and royalties resulting from the sales of products developed under licenses of our intellectual property. We expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing and amount of license fees, research and development reimbursements, milestone and other payments received under our strategic partnerships, and the payments that we receive upon the sale of our products, to the extent any are successfully commercialized. We do not expect to generate revenue from product sales in the near term. If we or our strategic partners fail to complete the development of our drug candidates in a timely manner or obtain regulatory approval for them, our ability to generate future revenue, and our results of operations and financial position, would be materially adversely affected.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses have historically consisted of expenses incurred in connection with the discovery and development of our product candidates. We recognize research and development expenses as they are incurred. These expenses consist primarily of:\n \u2022 employee-related expenses, which include salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense; \n \u2022 expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, investigative sites and consultants that conduct our clinical trials and a substantial portion of our preclinical studies; \n \u2022 the cost of acquiring and manufacturing drug development related materials; \n \u2022 the cost of completing certain tivozanib clinical development activities that were initiated as part of our prior partnership with Astellas; \n \u2022 facilities, depreciation and other allocated expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and equipment, and depreciation of fixed assets; \n \u2022 license fees for, and milestone payments related to, in-licensed products and technology; and \n \u2022 costs associated with outsourced development activities, regulatory approvals and medical affairs \nResearch and development expenses are net of amounts reimbursed under our agreements with Astellas and Biodesix for Astellas' and Biodesix' respective shares of development costs incurred by us under our joint development plans with each respective partner.\nWe expect that research and development expenses in 2017 will remain at current levels as we seek to advance and complete enrollment in the TIVO-3 trial and the TiNivo trial.\nWe track external development expenses and personnel expense on a program-by-program basis and allocate common expenses, such as scientific consultants and laboratory supplies, to each program based on the personnel resources allocated to such program. Facilities, depreciation, stock-based compensation, research and development management and research and development support services are not allocated among programs and are considered overhead. Below is a summary of our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively:\n\nTivozanib\nWe have pursued partnering options to fund further tivozanib development in appropriate clinical settings outside of our strategic focus. Our licensee, EUSA, has submitted an application for marketing authorization for tivozanib for the treatment of RCC to the EMA. EUSA is responsible for all activities and costs associated with the further development and commercialization of tivozanib within its licensed territories, excluding non-oncologic diseases or conditions of the eye. We continue to share the costs of development activities to which we and Astellas were committed at the time the Astellas partnership was terminated.\nIn May 2016, we initiated TIVO-3, an additional phase 3 trial of tivozanib vs. sorafenib. TIVO-3, which is expected to enroll approximately 322 patients in the refractory RCC setting, will use progression-free survival, or PFS, as the primary endpoint and OS as a secondary endpoint, and is designed to address the OS concerns presented in the June 2013 complete response letter from the FDA and to support a request for approval of tivozanib as a third-line treatment and as a first-line treatment. We expect the total estimated remaining costs of this trial, including drug supply and distribution, to be approximately $22.0 million to $25.0 million through completion. We have also initiated the TiNivo trial in collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb, or BMS, which is providing nivolumab for the study. We are the study sponsor. The TiNivo trial is a phase 1/2 trial of tivozanib in combination with nivolumab, a PD-1 inhibitor, for the treatment of RCC, for which our costs, including tivozanib drug supply and distribution, could be in the range of $2.0 million to $2.5 million.\nAV-380 Program in Cachexia\nIn August 2015, we entered into a license agreement with Novartis, under which we granted Novartis the exclusive right to develop and commercialize AV-380 and related AVEO antibodies that bind to GDF15 worldwide. Under this agreement, Novartis is responsible for all activities and costs associated with the further development, regulatory filing and commercialization of AV-380 worldwide. We do not expect to incur any significant costs related to AV-380 in future periods beyond any milestone fees and royalties payable to St.Vincent's pursuant to our in-licensing agreement, which comprises substantially all of the costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAV-203\nIn March 2014, we regained our worldwide rights from Biogen Idec to develop, manufacture and commercialize AV-203. In March 2016, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with CANbridge, under which we granted CANbridge the exclusive right to develop and commercialize AV-203 in all countries other than the United States, Canada and Mexico. CANbridge is responsible for all costs of developing and commercializing AV-203 within its licensed territory. For a period of time following the completion of certain proof-of-concept clinical studies by CANbridge involving the use of AV-203 for the treatment of squamous cell esophagus cancer, we agreed to negotiate exclusively with CANbridge for (a) the right to co-develop ErbB3 inhibitory antibody products for the treatment of squamous cell esophagus cancer or (b) the right to include the United States, Canada and Mexico as part of the licensed territories. We do not expect to incur any significant costs related to AV-203 prior to CANbridge's completion of a proof-of-concept clinical study.\nFiclatuzumab\nIn April 2014, we entered into the Biodesix Agreement to develop and commercialize ficlatuzumab, our potent HGF inhibitory antibody. Pursuant to the agreement, Biodesix was to provide up to $15.0 million for the phase 2 FOCAL trial of ficlatuzumab in combination with erlotinib in first-line advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients selected using Biodesix's proprietary companion diagnostic VeriStrat. In connection with the discontinuation of the FOCAL trial, on October 14, 2016 we and Biodesix amended the Biodesix Agreement. Under the amendment, we agreed to fund 50% of the shutdown costs of the FOCAL trial after August 1, 2016. In return, we would be entitled to reimbursement at a multiple of such shutdown expenses out of any future revenues Biodesix receives from ficlatuzumab. All manufacturing and all non-FOCAL development, regulatory or commercial expenses for ficlatuzumab will continue to be equally shared, as provided in the original Biodesix Agreement. Due to the unpredictable nature of clinical development, we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur in the future development of ficlatuzumab.\nUncertainties of Estimates Related to Research and Development Expenses\nThe process of conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials necessary to obtain FDA approval for each of our product candidates is costly and time-consuming. The probability of success for each product candidate and clinical trial may be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the quality of the product candidate's early clinical data, investment in the program, competition, manufacturing capabilities and commercial viability.\nAt this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, specific timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of our product candidates, or the period, if any, in which material net cash inflows may commence from sales of any approved products. This uncertainty is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs, including the uncertainty of:\n \u2022 our ability to establish and maintain strategic partnerships, the terms of those strategic partnerships and the success of those strategic partnerships, if any, including the timing and amount of payments that we might receive from strategic partners; \n \u2022 the scope, progress, results and costs of preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for any product candidate; \n \u2022 the progress and results of our clinical trials; \n \u2022 the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates; \n \u2022 the emergence of competing technologies and products and other adverse market developments; and \n \u2022 the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property-related claims. \nAs a result of the uncertainties associated with developing drugs, including those discussed above, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of current or future clinical stages of our product candidates, or when, or to what extent, we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates. Development timelines, probability of success and development costs vary widely. We anticipate that we will make determinations as to which additional programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific and clinical success, if any, of each product candidate, as well as ongoing assessment of each product candidate's commercial potential. We will need to raise substantial additional capital in the future in order to fund the development of our preclinical and clinical product candidates.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and related costs for personnel in executive, finance, corporate development, information technology, legal and human resource functions. Other general and administrative expenses include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, patent filing, prosecution and defense costs and professional fees for legal, consulting, pre-commercialization activities, auditing and tax services. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses in 2017 will remain at current levels.\nWarrants Issued in Connection with Private Placement\nWe account for warrant instruments that either conditionally or unconditionally obligate the issuer to transfer assets as liabilities regardless of the timing of the redemption feature or price, even though the underlying shares may be classified as permanent or temporary equity. These warrants are subject to revaluation at each balance sheet date, and any changes in fair value are recorded as a non-cash component of other expense, until the earlier of their exercise or expiration or upon the completion of a liquidation event.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest income consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The primary objective of our investment policy is capital preservation. Interest expense consists of interest, amortization of debt discount, and amortization of deferred financing costs associated with our loans payable.\nIncome Taxes\nWe calculate our provision for income taxes on ordinary income based on our projected annual tax rate for the year. We recorded a loss for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, and since we maintain a full valuation allowance on all of our deferred tax assets, we have recorded no income tax provision or benefit during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, except for a $0.1 million provision recorded in the year ended December 31, 2016 related to withholding taxes incurred in a foreign jurisdiction.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, accrued clinical expenses, and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we and our management believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenues have historically been generated primarily through collaborative research, development and commercialization agreements. The terms of these agreements generally contain multiple elements, or deliverables, which may include (i) licenses, or options to obtain licenses, to our technology, (ii) research and development activities to be performed on behalf of the collaborative partner, and (iii) in certain cases, services in connection with the manufacturing of pre-clinical and clinical material. Payments to us under these arrangements typically include one or more of the following: non-refundable, upfront license fees; option exercise fees; funding of research and/or development efforts; milestone payments; and royalties on future product sales.\nWhen evaluating multiple element arrangements, we consider whether the deliverables under the arrangement represent separate units of accounting. This evaluation requires subjective determinations and requires management to make judgments about the individual deliverables and whether such deliverables are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship. In determining the units of accounting, management evaluates certain criteria, including whether the deliverables have standalone value, based on the relevant facts and circumstances for each arrangement. The consideration received is allocated among the separate units of accounting using the relative selling price method, and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units.\nWe determine the estimated selling price for deliverables within each agreement using vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of selling price, if available, third-party evidence, or TPE, of selling price if VSOE is not available, or best estimate of selling price if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. Determining the best estimate of selling price for a deliverable requires significant judgment. We typically use best estimates of selling price to estimate the selling price for licenses to our proprietary technology, since we often do not have VSOE or TPE of selling price for these deliverables. In those circumstances where we utilize the best estimate of selling price to determine the estimated selling price of a license to our proprietary technology, we consider market conditions as well as entity-specific factors, including those factors contemplated in negotiating the agreements and internally developed models that include assumptions related to the market opportunity, estimated development costs, probability of success and the time needed to commercialize a product candidate pursuant to the applicable license. In validating our best estimate of selling price, we evaluate whether changes in the key assumptions used to determine the best estimate of selling price will have a significant effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration among multiple deliverables.\nWe typically receive non-refundable, upfront payments when licensing our intellectual property in conjunction with a research and development agreement. When management believes the license to our intellectual property does not have stand-alone value from the other deliverables to be provided in the arrangement, we generally recognize revenue attributed to the license on a straight-line basis over our contractual or estimated performance period, which is typically the term of our research and development obligations. If management cannot reasonably estimate when our performance obligation ends, then revenue is deferred until management can\nreasonably estimate when the performance obligation ends. When management believes the license to our intellectual property has stand-alone value, we generally recognize revenue attributed to the license upon delivery. The periods over which revenue should be recognized are subject to estimates by management and may change over the course of the research and development agreement. Such a change could have a material impact on the amount of revenue we record in future periods.\nPayments or reimbursements resulting from our research and development efforts for those arrangements where such efforts are considered as deliverables are recognized as the services are performed and are presented on a gross basis so long as there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. Amounts received prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying balance sheets.\nAt the inception of each agreement that includes milestone payments, we evaluate whether each milestone is substantive and at risk to both parties on the basis of the contingent nature of the milestone. This evaluation includes an assessment of whether (a) the consideration is commensurate with either (1) the entity's performance to achieve the milestone, or (2) the enhancement of the value of the delivered item(s) as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the entity's performance to achieve the milestone, (b) the consideration relates solely to past performance, and (c) the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement. We evaluate factors such as the scientific, regulatory, commercial and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the respective milestone, the level of effort and investment required to achieve the respective milestone and whether the milestone consideration is reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement in making this assessment.\nWe aggregate our milestones into four categories: (i) clinical and development milestones, (ii) regulatory milestones, (iii) commercial milestones, and (iv) patent-related milestones. Clinical and development milestones are typically achieved when a product candidate advances into a defined phase of clinical research or completes such phase. For example, a milestone payment may be due to us upon the initiation of a phase 3 clinical trial for a new indication, which is the last phase of clinical development and could eventually contribute to marketing approval by the FDA or other global regulatory authorities. Regulatory milestones are typically achieved upon acceptance of the submission for marketing approval of a product candidate or upon approval to market the product candidate by the FDA or other global regulatory authorities. For example, a milestone payment may be due to us upon the FDA's acceptance of a New Drug Application, or NDA. Commercial milestones are typically achieved when an approved pharmaceutical product reaches certain defined levels of net sales by the licensee, such as when a product first achieves global sales or annual sales of a specified amount. Patent-related milestones are typically achieved when a patent application is filed or a patent is issued with respect to certain intellectual property related to the applicable collaboration.\nRevenues from clinical and development, regulatory, and patent-related milestone payments, if the milestones are deemed substantive and the milestone payments are nonrefundable, are recognized upon successful accomplishment of the milestones. We have concluded that the clinical and development, regulatory and patent-related milestones pursuant to our current research and development arrangements are substantive. Milestones that are not considered substantive are accounted for as license payments and recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining period of performance. Revenues from commercial milestone payments are accounted for as royalties and are recorded as revenue upon achievement of the milestone, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\nAccrued Expenses and Accrued Clinical Trial Costs and Contract Research Liabilities\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate accrued expenses. This process involves identifying services which have been performed on our behalf, and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements. Given our current business, the primary area of uncertainty concerning accruals which could have a material effect on our operating results is with respect to service fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of clinical drug supplies and to contract research organizations in connection with our clinical trials. In connection with all of the foregoing service fees, our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided. The majority of our service providers, including contract research organizations, invoice us in arrears for services performed. In the event that we do not identify some costs which have begun to be incurred, or we under or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services in a given period, our reported expenses for such period would be understated or overstated. We currently reflect the effects of any changes in estimates based on changes in facts and circumstances directly in our operations in the period such change becomes known.\nOur arrangements with contract research organizations in connection with clinical trials often provide for payment prior to commencing the project or based upon predetermined milestones throughout the period during which services are expected to be performed. We recognize expense relating to these arrangements based on the various services provided over the estimated time to completion. The date on which services commence, the level of services performed on or before a given date, and the cost of such services are often determined based on subjective judgments. We make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances\nknown to us based on the terms of the contract and our ongoing monitoring of service performance. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we had arrangements with multiple contract research organizations whereby these organizations commit to performing services for us over multiple reporting periods. We recognize the expenses associated with these arrangements based on our expectation of the timing of the performance of components under these arrangements by these organizations. Generally, these components consist of the costs of setting up the trial, monitoring the trial, closing the trial and preparing the resulting data. Costs related to patient enrollment in clinical trials are accrued as patients are enrolled in the trial.\nWith respect to financial reporting periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and based on our receipt of invoices from our third party providers, the timing of our actual costs incurred have not differed materially from our estimated timing of such costs. In light of the foregoing, we do not believe our practices for estimating future expenses and making judgments concerning the accrual of expenses are reasonably likely to change in the future.\nStock-Based Compensation\nUnder our stock-based compensation programs, we periodically grant stock options and restricted stock to employees, directors and nonemployee consultants. We also issue shares under an employee stock purchase plan. The fair value of all awards is recognized in our statements of operations over the requisite service period for each award.\nAwards that vest as the recipient provides service are expensed on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Other awards, such as performance-based awards that vest upon the achievement of specified goals, are expensed using the accelerated attribution method if achievement of the specified goals is considered probable. We have also granted awards that vest upon the achievement of market conditions. Per Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 718 Share-Based Payments, market conditions must be considered in determining the estimated grant-date fair value of share-based payments and the market conditions must be considered in determining the requisite service period over which compensation cost is recognized. We estimate the fair value of the awards with market conditions using a Monte Carlo simulation, which utilizes several assumptions including the risk-free interest rate, the volatility of our stock and the exercise behavior of award recipients. The grant-date fair value of the awards is then recognized over the requisite service period, which represents the derived service period for the awards as determined by the Monte Carlo simulation.\nWe use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value our stock option awards without market conditions, which requires us to make certain assumptions regarding the expected volatility of our common stock price, the expected term of the option grants, the risk-free interest rate and the dividend yield with respect to our common stock. In 2016, we began calculating volatility using our historical data. Previously, we did not have sufficient history to support a calculation of volatility using only our historical data. As such, prior to 2016, we used a weighted-average volatility considering our own volatility since March 2010 and the volatilities of several peer companies. For purposes of identifying similar entities, we considered characteristics such as industry, length of trading history, similar vesting terms and in-the-money option status. Due to a lack of our own historical data, we elected to use the simplified\u201d method for plain vanilla\u201d options to estimate the expected term of our stock option grants. Under this approach, the weighted-average expected life is presumed to be the average of the vesting term and the contractual term of the option. The risk-free interest rate used for each grant is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for instruments with a similar expected life. We utilize a dividend yield of zero based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and have no present intention to pay cash dividends.\nThe fair value of equity-classified awards to employees and directors are measured at fair value on the date the awards are granted. Awards to nonemployee consultants are recorded at their fair values and are re-measured as of each balance sheet date until the recipient's services are complete.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes pricing model for new grants were as follows:\n\nWe recognized stock-based compensation expense of approximately $1.0 million, $1.1 million and $2.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. During the years ending December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we estimated our expected forfeiture rates to be 76%, 71% and 62%, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $0.8 million of\ntotal unrecognized stock-based compensation expense for stock options, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.5 years.\nWe record compensation expense only for those awards that we ultimately expect will vest. We have performed an historical analysis of option awards that were forfeited prior to vesting and recorded total stock option expense that reflected this estimated forfeiture rate. We cannot currently predict the total amount of stock-based compensation expense to be recognized in any future period because such amounts will depend on levels of stock-based payments granted in the future as well as the portion of the awards that actually vest. Forfeitures are estimated each period and adjusted if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Actual forfeitures may differ from our estimates as a result of significant changes in our operations.\nWe have historically granted stock options at exercise prices that are not less than the fair market value of our common stock.\nWarrants Issued in Connection with Private Placement\nWe account for warrant instruments that either conditionally or unconditionally obligate the issuer to transfer assets as liabilities regardless of the timing of the redemption feature or price, even though the underlying shares may be classified as permanent or temporary equity. In May 2016, we issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 17,642,482 shares of our common stock in connection with a private placement financing and recorded the warrants as a liability. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources-Private Placement/PIPE Warrants\u201d below. The fair value of these warrants has been determined using the Black-Scholes pricing model. These warrants are subject to revaluation at each balance sheet date, and any changes in fair value are recorded as a non-cash component of other income (expense), net in our Statements of Operations until the earlier of their exercise or expiration or upon the completion of a liquidation event.\nThe key assumptions used to value the PIPE Warrants were as follows:\n\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014\nRevenues\n\nIn 2016 as compared to 2015, revenue decreased by $16.5 million, principally due to $18.5 million in revenue that was recognized in 2015 related to Novartis for the $15.0 million upfront payment received in connection with our licensing agreement entered into in August 2015 and $3.5 million for the purchase of our inventory of clinical material in the fourth quarter of 2015. This decrease was partially offset by the $1.0 million upfront payment received in connection with our collaboration and license agreement with CANbridge entered into in March 2016 and $0.8 million in the acceleration of deferred revenue that was recognized upon the effective termination of our licensing agreement with Pharmstandard in September 2016 that otherwise would have been recognized over the performance period through April 2022.\nIn 2015 as compared to 2014, revenue increased by $0.9 million principally due to the recognition of $18.5 million of revenue associated with the receipt of a $15.0 million upfront payment for our license of AV-380 to Novartis and Novartis' subsequent purchase of clinical material for $3.5 million. These amounts were partially offset by a decrease of $3.6 million of revenue from Astellas following the termination of our collaboration agreement in 2014 and a decrease of $14.3 million of revenue recognized from our arrangement with Biogen due to the one-time recognition of previously deferred revenue following an amendment to our agreement in 2014.\nResearch and Development Expenses\n\nIn 2016 as compared to 2015, research and development expenses increased by $10.8 million due to a $12.7 million increase in tivozanib, principally related to the advancement of the TIVO-3 trial that commenced patient enrollment and treatment in May 2016. This increase was partially offset by a $1.5 million decrease related to the upfront fee incurred under the amended St. Vincent's license agreement entered into in August 2015. We expect that research and development expenses in 2017 will remain at current levels as we seek to advance and complete enrollment in the TIVO-3 and TiNivo trials.\nIn 2015 as compared to 2014, research and development expenses decreased by $25.4 million principally attributable to a $7.8 million decrease in employee compensation, benefits, contract labor and consulting and a decrease of $9.2 million in facilities, IT, and other costs following our January 2015 restructuring; a decrease of $7.6 million in outsourced services costs primarily related to the completion of the manufacture of AV-380 material in 2014; and a decrease of $0.8 million in medical affairs and external clinical trial costs associated with the decreased number of active patients enrolled in our clinical trials.\nIncluded in research and development expenses were stock-based compensation expenses of approximately $0.3 million in each of 2016 and 2015, and $0.9 million in 2014.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\n\nIn 2016 as compared to 2015, general and administrative expenses decreased by $6.0 million, principally the result of a $4.8 million decrease in external costs associated with various ongoing legal matters, including $4.0 million related to the settlement of SEC claims and $0.8 million in legal fees, as well as a $0.7 million decrease in employee compensation following our decreased headcount and the reduction of our utilized facility space following our 2015 restructuring. In 2017, we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will remain at current levels.\nIn 2015 as compared to 2014, general and administrative expenses decreased by $4.4 million, principally the result of a $4.1 million decrease in salaries, benefits, contract labor and consulting and a decrease of $4.5 million in facilities, IT, insurance and other infrastructure costs following our January 2015 restructuring as well as a $2.0 million decrease in external legal costs associated with various ongoing legal matters. These amounts were partially offset by $4.0 million in expense incurred in 2015 related to the accrual of an estimated settlement liability, for accounting purposes, related to the SEC claims and an increase in depreciation expense of $2.2 million due to the acceleration of depreciation in connection with the termination of our lease agreement of 650 East Kendall Street in September 2014.\nIncluded in general and administrative expenses were stock-based compensation expenses of approximately $0.7 million, $0.8 million and $1.9 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nRestructuring and Lease Exit\n\nIn 2016 as compared to 2015, restructuring and lease exit expenses decreased by $4.4 million as a result of the January 2015 restructuring that was substantially completed in March 2015. As part of this restructuring, we eliminated our internal research function, reducing our headcount by approximately 40 positions.\nIn 2015 as compared to 2014, restructuring and lease exit expenses decreased by $7.4 million. The expenses incurred during 2015 relate to costs associated with elimination of our research function and the associated reductions in headcount as part of our January 2015 restructuring. The expenses incurred during 2014 relate to costs associated with partially vacating and subsequently terminating the agreement for our leased space at 650 East Kendall Street, which occurred in September 2014.\nChange in Fair Value of Warrant Liability\n\nIn May 2016, we issued warrants in connection with a private placement financing and recorded the warrants as a liability. The changes in the fair value at the end of each reporting date are recorded as a non-cash gain or loss in the Statements of Operations. The lower stock price as of the December 31, 2016 reporting date principally resulted in a $4.8 million gain in fair value during 2016.\nInterest Expense, net\n\nIn 2016 as compared to 2015, interest expense, net decreased by $0.3 million principally attributable to the decrease in the average outstanding balances on our loan with Hercules, resulting from amounts borrowed under the 2012 Amendment being paid in full by the end of 2015. In 2017, we anticipate that interest expense will remain at current levels.\nIn 2015 as compared to 2014, interest expense, net decreased by $0.1 million principally attributable to the declining average outstanding balance on our loan with Hercules.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our non-cancellable contractual obligations at December 31, 2016 (in thousands):\n\n (1) Includes scheduled interest payments and end of term payments totaling $690,000 due at the time of the final payments of the outstanding principal in connection with the 2014 Amendment and 2016 Amendment under the Hercules loan agreement. \n (2) Clinical trial costs and contract research principally include contracts for human clinical trials and clinical drug distribution. In the event a contract is terminated prior to the planned completion, the amount paid under such contracts may be less than the amounts presented. \n (3) We sublease our principal office facility at One Broadway in Cambridge, MA. Our lease arrangement is cancellable within 30 days' notice to our landlord. As a result, our operating lease obligation as of December 31, 2016 is the January 2017 rent payable to our landlord \n (4) Under our license agreement with Kyowa Hakko Kirin, we are required to make certain milestone payments upon the achievement of specified regulatory milestones. We are also required to pay 30% of certain amounts we receive from sublicensees, including upfront license fees, milestone payments and royalties, other than amounts we receive in respect of research and development funding or equity investments, subject to certain limitations. Additionally, under our license agreement with St. Vincent's, we are required to make certain milestone payments upon the earlier of achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones or a specified date for the first indication, and upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones for the second and third indications. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate when or if we may be required to make other additional payments to Kyowa Hakko Kirin or St. Vincent's and have not included any additional amounts in the table above. \n (5) As discussed in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements, we have executed license agreements for patented technology and other technology related to research projects, including technology to humanize ficlatuzumab and other antibody product candidates. The license agreements required us to pay non-refundable license fees upon execution, and in certain cases, require milestone payments upon the achievement of defined development goals. We have not included any additional milestone payments in the table above as we are not able to make a reasonable estimate of the probability and timing of such payments, if any. In addition to the amounts in the table above, these four agreements include sales and development milestones of up to $22.5 million. $5.5 million and $4.2 million per product, respectively, and single digit royalties as a percentage. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have financed our operations to date primarily through the sale of private placements and public offerings of our common stock and preferred stock, license fees, milestone payments and research and development funding from strategic partners, and loan proceeds. In May 2016, we raised approximately $20.3 million in net cash proceeds, consisting of $15.4 million in net proceeds from a private placement of 17,642,842 units, each including one share of our common stock and a warrant to purchase one share of our common stock, and $4.9 million in net proceeds from additional borrowings under our Hercules loan agreement. As of December 31, 2016, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $23.3 million. See -Operating Capital Requirements and Going Concern\u201d below and Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of our liquidity and the conditions and events which raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. Currently, our funds are invested in a U.S. government money market fund, and corporate debt securities, including commercial paper. The following table sets forth the primary sources and uses of cash for each of the periods set forth below:\n\nOur operating activities used cash of $31.1 million, $18.2 million and $54.2 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Cash used in operations was due principally to our net loss adjusted for non-cash items and changes in working capital.\nOur investing activities used cash of $0.8 million and $6.3 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, and provided $54.7 million in 2014. Cash used by investing activities in each of 2016 and 2015 was principally the net result of the purchase of marketable securities, partially offset by the maturities of marketable securities in each period and proceeds from the sale of equipment of $1.2 million in 2015. Cash provided by investing activities in 2014 was the net result of maturities of marketable securities, partially offset by the purchase of marketable securities and purchases of property and equipment of $12.9 million.\nOur financing activities provided cash of $20.3 million and $1.0 million in 2016 and 2014, respectively, and used cash of $1.1 million in 2015. In 2016, we raised approximately $20.3 million in net cash proceeds, consisting of $15.4 million in net proceeds from a private placement of 17,642,842 units, each including one share of our common stock and a warrant to purchase one share of our common stock, or the PIPE Warrants, and $4.9 million in net proceeds from additional borrowings under our Hercules loan agreement. In 2015, we raised approximately $10.5 million in net proceeds from the sale of our common stock, including $10.2 million under our at-the-market, or ATM, facility with FBR & Co., or FBR, (formerly MLV & Co. LLC), and $0.3 million from the issuance of stock for stock-based compensation arrangements, offset by $11.6 million in principal payments under our Hercules loan agreement. In 2014, we raised approximately $8.8 million in net cash proceeds, including $8.6 million in net proceeds from the additional borrowings under our Hercules loan agreement and $0.2 million from the issuance of stock for stock-based compensation arrangements offset by $7.8 million in principal payments on loans payable to Hercules.\nPrivate Placement / PIPE Warrants\nIn May 2016, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with a select group of qualified institutional buyers, institutional accredited investors and accredited investors pursuant to which we sold 17,642,482 units, at a price of $0.965 per unit, for gross proceeds of approximately $17.0 million. Each unit consisted of one share of our common stock and a warrant to purchase one share of our common stock, which we refer to as the PIPE Warrants. The PIPE Warrants have an exercise price of $1.00 per share and are exercisable in any manner at any time for a period of five years from the date of issuance. Certain of our directors and executive officers purchased an aggregate of 544,039 units in this offering at the same price as the other investors. The net offering proceeds to us were approximately $15.4 million after deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses payable by us.\nThe PIPE Warrants contain a provision giving the warrant holder the option to receive cash, equal to the fair value of the remaining unexercised portion of the warrant, as cash settlement in the event that there is a fundamental transaction (contractually defined to include various merger, acquisition or stock transfer activities). Due to this provision, ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity requires that these warrants be classified as a liability and not as equity. Accordingly, we recorded a warrant liability in the amount of approximately $9.3 million. The fair value of these warrants has been determined using the Black-Scholes pricing model and the changes in the fair value at the time of each reporting date are recorded in the Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded an approximate $4.8 million gain in fair value in the Statements of Operations that principally resulted from the lower stock price as of the December 31, 2016 reporting date. As of December 31, 2016, none of the PIPE Warrants have been exercised.\nAt-The-Market Issuance Sales Agreement with FBR\nIn February 2015, we entered into an at-the-market issuance sales agreement, which we refer to as the Sales Agreement, with FBR & Co., or FBR, (formerly MLV & Co. LLC), pursuant to which we could issue and sell shares of our common stock from time to time up to an aggregate amount of $17.9 million, at our option, through FBR as our sales agent. Sales of common stock through FBR may be made by any method that is deemed an at-the-market\u201d offering as defined in Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Sales Agreement, FBR will use commercially reasonable efforts to sell our common stock based upon our instructions (including any price, time or size limits or other customary parameters or conditions we may impose). We are not obligated to make any sales of common stock under the Sales Agreement. Any shares sold will be sold pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3. We are required to pay FBR a commission of up to 3% of the gross proceeds. The Sales Agreement may be terminated by us at any time.\nOn May 7, 2015, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, which we refer to as the 2015 Shelf. The 2015 Shelf covers the offering, issuance and sale of up to $100 million of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and/or units. The 2015 Shelf was filed to replace our then existing $250 million shelf registration statement, which expired at the end of May 2015, and which we refer to as the 2012 Shelf. On May 7, 2015, we also amended the Sales Agreement to provide for the offering, issuance and sale of up to $15.0 million of our common stock under the 2015 Shelf. The prior at-the-market offering initiated under the original Sales Agreement expired along with the 2012 Shelf. As of December 31, 2016, we have sold approximately 5.9 million shares pursuant to the Sales Agreement, as amended, resulting in proceeds of approximately $10.2 million, net of commissions and issuance costs. No shares have been sold during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nApproximately $9.1 million remains available for sale under the Sales Agreement.\nCredit Facilities\nOn May 28, 2010, we entered into a loan and security agreement, or the Loan Agreement, with Hercules. The Loan Agreement was subsequently amended in March 2012, or the 2012 Amendment; September 2014, or the 2014 Amendment; and May 2016, or the 2016 Amendment. Amounts borrowed under the 2012 Amendment were repaid in full in 2015.\nPursuant to the 2014 Amendment, we received additional loan proceeds from Hercules in the amount of $10.0 million and were not required to commence principal payments until May 1, 2016. An end-of-term payment of approximately $0.5 million continues to be due on January 1, 2018 or on such earlier date if the loan is prepaid.\nPursuant to the 2016 Amendment, we received additional loan proceeds from Hercules in the amount of $5.0 million, which increased the aggregate outstanding principal balance under the Loan Agreement to $15.0 million. We are not required to commence principal payments on the $15.0 million loan until July 1, 2017, at which time we will be required to make 30 equal monthly payments of principal and interest through December 2019. An end-of-term payment of approximately $0.2 million is due on December 1, 2019. The 2016 Amendment includes a financial covenant that requires us to maintain an unrestricted cash position greater than or equal to $10.0 million through the date of completion of our Phase 3 TIVO-3 trial. Refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion of the adverse consequences of failure to comply with the financial covenant.\nUnder the 2016 Amendment, from March 1, 2017 through June 30, 2017, we may draw down an additional $5.0 million in funding upon the satisfaction of the following conditions: (i) achieving developmental progression satisfactory to Hercules on a minimum of two (2) clinical programs (other than the Phase 3 TIVO-3 trial) that are either managed directly by us or funded, in whole or in part, by us and (ii) having an unrestricted cash position greater than or equal to $25.0 million on the date of the draw down request. If we draw down the additional $5.0 million in funding, the commencement of principal payments on the aggregate $20.0 million loan balance will be deferred by six months from July 1, 2017 until January 1, 2018.\nWe must make interest payments on the principal balance of the loan each month it remains outstanding. Per annum interest is payable on the loan balance at the greater of 11.9% and an amount equal to 11.9% plus the prime rate minus 4.75%, as determined daily, provided however, that the per annum interest rate shall not exceed 15.0%. Our annual interest rate as of December 31, 2016 was 11.9%.\nWe have determined that the risk of subjective acceleration under the material adverse events clause included in this loan and security agreement is remote and, therefore, have classified the outstanding principal amount in current and long-term liabilities based on the timing of scheduled principal payments. As of December 31, 2016, we are in compliance with all of the financial covenants and, through the date of this filing, the lenders have not asserted any events of default under the loan. We do not believe that there has been a material adverse change as defined in the loan agreement.\nThe loans are secured by a lien on all of our personal property (other than intellectual property), whether owned as of, or acquired after, the date of the Loan Agreement.\nOperating Capital Requirements and Going Concern\nWe have devoted substantially all of our resources to our drug development efforts, comprised of research and development, manufacturing, conducting clinical trials for our product candidates, protecting our intellectual property and general and administrative functions relating to these operations. Our future success is dependent on our ability to develop our product candidates and ultimately upon our ability to attain profitable operations. As of December 31, 2016, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling approximately $23.3 million, working capital of $16.0 million and an accumulated deficit of $521.9 million.\nWe anticipate that we will continue to incur significant operating losses for the next several years as we incur expenses to continue to execute on our clinical development strategy to advance our clinical stage assets. We will require substantial additional funds to continue our development programs and to fulfill our planned operating goals. In particular, our currently planned operating and capital requirements include the need for substantial working capital to support our development activities for tivozanib. For example, we estimate that the remaining costs for the TIVO-3 trial for RCC, including drug supply and distribution, could be in the range of $22.0 million to $25.0 million in the aggregate through 2018. We have also initiated the TiNivo trial in collaboration with BMS, which is providing nivolumab for the study. We are the study sponsor. The TiNivo trial is a phase 1/2 study of tivozanib combined with nivolumab, a PD-1 inhibitor, for the treatment of patients with RCC for which our costs, including tivozanib drug supply and distribution, could be in the range of $2.0 million to $2.5 million through 2018. Moreover, we have future payment obligations and cost-sharing arrangements under certain of our collaboration and license agreements. For example, under our agreements with KHK and St. Vincent's, we are required to make certain clinical and regulatory milestone payments, have royalty obligations with respect to product sales and are required to pay a specified percentage of sublicense revenue in certain instances.\nWe are subject to a number of risks, including the need for substantial additional capital for clinical research and product development and the risk that we are unable to maintain compliance with our financial covenant pursuant to our Loan Agreement with Hercules, which requires us to maintain unrestricted cash (defined as cash and liquid cash, including marketable securities) greater\nthan or equal to $10.0 million through the date of completion of our Phase 3 TIVO-3 trial. Non-compliance with the financial covenant would be considered an event of default that could result in Hercules, at its option, accelerating and demanding payment of all outstanding obligations together with a prepayment charge. Refer to Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further description of our Loan Agreement.\nBased upon our approximate $23.3 million in existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2016, we do not have sufficient cash on hand to support operations and maintain compliance with the $10.0 million financial covenant under our Loan Agreement with Hercules for at least the next twelve months from the date of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur plans to address these conditions include pursuing one or more of the following steps to raise additional funding, none of which can be guaranteed or are entirely within our control:\n \u2022 Raise funding through the possible sales of our common stock, including public or private equity financings. \n \u2022 Raise funding of up to $9.1 million through possible sales of our common stock under our Sales Agreement with FBR. \n \u2022 Satisfy the conditions that are set forth in our Loan Agreement with Hercules that would enable us to draw down an additional $5.0 million in funding under the Loan Agreement, as further described in -Credit Facilities\u201d above. If we draw down the additional $5.0 million in funding, the commencement of principal payments on the aggregate $20.0 million loan balance will be deferred by six months from July 1, 2017 until January 1, 2018. \n \u2022 Continue to seek a partner to advance development of the AV-353 platform for the potential treatment of PAH. \n \u2022 Earn milestone payments pursuant to collaboration and license agreements or restructure / monetize existing potential milestone and/or royalty payments under those collaboration and license agreements. \nThere can be no assurance, however, that we will receive cash proceeds from any of these potential resources or, to the extent cash proceeds are received, those proceeds would be sufficient to support our operations and allow us to maintain compliance with our financial covenant for at least the next twelve months from the date of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have concluded the likelihood that our plan to obtain sufficient funding from one or more of these sources will be successful, while reasonably possible, is less than probable. Accordingly, we have concluded that substantial doubt exists regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe believe that our approximate $23.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2016 could allow us to fund our planned operations into the fourth quarter of 2017. This estimate assumes no receipt of milestone payments from our partners or related payment of potential licensing milestones to third parties, no additional funding from new partnership agreements, no equity financings, no debt financings, no accelerated repayment of our term loan and no further sales of equity under our Sales Agreement with FBR. Accordingly, the timing and nature of activities contemplated for 2017 and thereafter will be conducted subject to the availability of sufficient financial resources.\nThere are numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products. Accordingly, our future funding requirements may vary from our current expectations and will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n \u2022 our ability to establish and maintain strategic partnerships, licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of such agreements; \n \u2022 the number and characteristics of the product candidates we pursue; \n \u2022 the scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing our product candidates, and of conducting preclinical and clinical trials; \n \u2022 the timing of, and the costs involved in, obtaining regulatory approvals for our product candidates; \n \u2022 the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims, including litigation costs and the outcome of such litigation; \n \u2022 the absence of any breach, acceleration event or event of default under our loan agreement with Hercules or under any other agreements with third parties; \n \u2022 the outcome of legal actions against us, including the current lawsuits described in Part I, Item 3 of this report under the heading Legal Proceedings\u201d; \n \u2022 the cost of commercialization activities if any of our product candidates are approved for sale, including marketing, sales and distribution costs; \n \u2022 the cost of manufacturing our product candidates and any products we successfully commercialize; \n \u2022 the timing, receipt and amount of sales of, or royalties on, our future products, if any; and \n \u2022 our ability to continue as a going concern. \nWe will require additional funding to extend our planned operations into 2018 and maintain compliance with our financial covenant under our Loan Agreement with Hercules. We may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities or preferred stock or through additional credit facilities, these securities and/or the loans under credit facilities could provide for rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. Additional funds may not be available when we need them, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. We also expect to seek additional funds through arrangements with collaborators, licensees or other third parties. These arrangements would generally require us to relinquish or encumber rights to some of our technologies or drug candidates, and we may not be able to enter into such arrangements on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to raise substantial additional capital in the near term, whether on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all then we may trigger an event of default under our Loan Agreement with Hercules and we may be required to:\n \u2022 delay, limit, reduce or terminate our clinical trials or other development activities for one or more of our product candidates; and/or \n \u2022 delay, limit, reduce or terminate our establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities that may be necessary to commercialize our product candidates, if approved. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have, during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under applicable SEC rules.\nTable 320: <table> <tr> <td>",

The financial tables indicate cash used in operations, investments, and financing activities, as well as a summary of non-cancellable contractual obligations.\n\nPlease note this is a high-level overview and does not capture all details or subtleties of the provided information. For a complete and accurate interpretation, a full review of the MD&A section in the company's 10-K report is necessary."}
