In computing these amounts and percentages, we compare the current period amount as translated into U.S. dollars under the applicable accounting standards to the prior period amount in local currency translated into U.S. dollars utilizing the weighted average translation rate for the current period.\nNet of tax amounts referenced above were computed using the statutory tax rate for the taxing jurisdictions in the operating segment in which the related expenses were recorded, adjusted for the effects of valuation allowances on net operating losses in certain jurisdictions.\nDuring 2016, we generated $95.8 million of cash flows from operations, we repurchased $50 million of our common stock and utilized approximately $10.8 million, net of cash acquired, to fund the acquisition of Ignia. We ended the year with $202.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and $39.5 million of debt outstanding under our long-term debt facilities.\nDuring 2016, we amended our revolving facility and our ABS facility and increased the combined maximum borrowing capacity available to us by $50 million and extended the maturity dates of the agreement to 2021 and 2019, respectively. In addition, we amended our inventory financing facility and increased the maximum capacity available to us under that facility by $75 million and extended the maturity date to 2021.\nDetails about segment results of operations can be found in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nOur discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist in the understanding of our consolidated financial statements, including the changes in certain key items in those consolidated financial statements from year to year and the primary factors that contributed to those changes, as well as how certain critical accounting estimates affect our consolidated financial statements.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nGeneral\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). For a summary of significant accounting policies, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results, however, may differ from our estimates. Members of our senior management have discussed the critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.\nWe consider the following to be our critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:\nSales Recognition\nSales are recognized when title and risk of loss are passed to the client, there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement for sale, delivery has occurred and/or services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Our standard sales terms are F.O.B. shipping point or equivalent, at which time title and risk of loss have passed to the client. However, because we either (i) have a general practice of covering client losses while products are in transit despite title and risk of loss contractually transferring at the point of shipment or (ii) have specifically stated F.O.B. destination contractual terms with the client, delivery is not deemed to have occurred until the point in time when the product is received by the client.\nWe leverage drop-shipment arrangements with many of our partners and suppliers to deliver products to our clients without having to physically hold the inventory at our warehouses, thereby increasing efficiency and reducing costs. We recognize revenue for drop-shipment arrangements on a gross basis when the product is received by the client. We recognize revenue on a gross basis as the principal in the transaction because we control the transaction as the primary obligor for product fulfillment in the arrangement, we assume inventory risk if the product is returned by the client, we set the price of the product charged to the client, we assume credit risk for the amounts invoiced, and we work closely with our clients to determine their hardware and software specifications.\nWe make provisions for estimated product returns that we expect to occur under our return policy based upon historical return rates. Our manufacturers warrant most of the products we market, and it is our policy to request that clients return their defective products directly to the manufacturer for warranty service during the manufacturer's warranty period. On selected products, and for selected client service reasons, we may accept returns directly from the client and then either credit the client or ship a replacement product. We generally offer a limited 15- to 30-day return policy for unopened products and certain opened products, which are consistent with manufacturers' terms; however, for some products we may charge restocking fees. Products returned opened are processed and returned to the manufacturer or partner for repair, replacement or credit to us. Subject to some manufacturers' restrictions, certain products cannot be returned to the manufacturer for warranty processing. We resell most unopened products returned to us. If we accept a return from a client that we cannot return to the partner, we try to mitigate our losses by selling to inventory liquidators, to end users as \u201cpreviously sold\u201d or \u201cused\u201d products, or through other channels.\nRevenue is recognized from software sales when clients acquire the right to use or copy software under license, but in no case prior to the commencement of the term of the initial software license agreement, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met (i.e., evidence of the arrangement exists, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility of the fee is probable).\nWe sell certain third-party service contracts and software maintenance and Cloud or software-as-a-service subscription products for which we are not the primary obligor. These sales do not meet the criteria for gross sales recognition and, thus, are recorded on a net sales recognition basis. As we enter into contracts with third-party service providers or vendors and our clients, we evaluate whether the subsequent sales of such services should be recorded as gross sales or net sales. We determine whether we act as a principal in the transaction and assume the risks and rewards of ownership or if we are simply acting as an agent or broker. Under gross sales recognition, the selling price is recorded in sales and our cost to the third-party service provider or vendor is recorded in costs of goods sold. Under net sales recognition, the cost to the third-party service provider or vendor is recorded as a reduction to sales, resulting in net sales equal to the gross profit on the transaction, and there are no costs of goods sold.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nWe recognize revenue for sales of services ratably over the time period over which the service will be provided if there is no discernible pattern of recognition of the cost to perform the service. Billings for such services that are made in advance of the related revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the billing coverage period. Revenue from certain arrangements that allow for the use of a product or service over a period of time without taking possession of software are also accounted for ratably over the time period over which the service will be provided.\nWe recognize revenue for professional services engagements that are on a time and materials basis based upon hours incurred as the services are performed and amounts are earned. Net sales for these service engagements are not a significant portion of our consolidated net sales.\nAdditionally, we sell certain professional services contracts on a fixed fee basis. Revenues for fixed fee professional services contracts are recognized based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs. Net sales for these service contracts are not a significant portion of our consolidated net sales.\nIn certain arrangements, we may provide a combination of hardware and software products and the provision of services. Services that are performed by us in conjunction with hardware and software sales that are completed in our facilities prior to shipment of the product are recognized upon delivery, when title passes to the client, for the hardware sale. Net sales of services that are performed at client locations are primarily service-only contracts and are recorded as sales when the services are performed. The total consideration for an arrangement with multiple deliverables is allocated to all deliverables that represent a separate unit of accounting using the relative selling price method.\nPartner Funding\nWe receive payments and credits from partners, including consideration pursuant to volume sales incentive programs, volume purchase incentive programs and shared marketing expense programs. Partner funding received pursuant to volume sales incentive programs is recognized as it is earned as a reduction to costs of goods sold. Partner funding received pursuant to volume purchase incentive programs is allocated as a reduction to inventories based on the applicable incentives earned from each partner and is recorded in costs of goods sold as the related inventory is sold. Partner funding received pursuant to shared marketing expense programs is recorded as it is earned as a reduction of the related selling and administrative expenses in the period the program takes place if the consideration represents a reimbursement of specific, incremental, identifiable costs. Consideration that exceeds the specific, incremental, identifiable costs is classified as a reduction of costs of goods sold. Changes in estimates of anticipated achievement levels under individual partner programs could have a material effect on our results of operations and our cash flows.\nSee Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further discussion of our accounting policies related to partner funding.\nValuation of Long-Lived Assets Including Purchased Intangible Assets and Goodwill\nWe review property, plant and equipment and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. If such events or changes in circumstances indicate a possible impairment, our asset impairment review assesses the recoverability of the assets based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or the asset group plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset or the asset group (if any) and compares that value to the carrying value. Such impairment test is based on the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between fair value and the carrying amount. This approach uses our estimates of future market growth, forecasted net sales and costs, expected periods the assets will be utilized and appropriate discount rates.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nWe perform an annual review of our goodwill in the fourth quarter of every year and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. We continually assess whether any indicators of impairment exist, and that assessment requires a significant amount of judgment. Events or circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, unanticipated competition, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business, significant negative industry or economic trends, significant declines in our stock price for a sustained period or significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future cash flows or results of operations. Any adverse change in these factors, among others, could have a significant effect on the recoverability of goodwill and could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nThe goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a \u201ccomponent\u201d). A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and management of the segment regularly reviews the operating results of that component. When two or more components of an operating segment have similar economic characteristics, the components may be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit. An operating segment shall be deemed to be a reporting unit if all of its components are similar, if none of its components is a reporting unit, or if the segment comprises only a single component. Insight has three reporting units, which are equivalent to our operating segments.\nWe may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If it is concluded that this is the case, it is necessary to perform a quantitative two-step goodwill impairment test. Otherwise, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. In completing a quantitative test for a potential impairment of goodwill, we first compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its book value, including goodwill. Management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of our reporting units. Multiple valuation techniques can be used to assess the fair value of the reporting unit, including the market and income approaches. All of these techniques include the use of estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value or goodwill impairment, or both. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to, an appropriate control premium in excess of the market capitalization of the Company, future market growth, forecasted sales and costs and appropriate discount rates. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates. Management evaluates the merits of each significant assumption, both individually and in the aggregate, used to determine the fair value of the reporting units. If the estimated fair value exceeds book value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary. To ensure the reasonableness of the estimated fair values of our reporting units, we perform a reconciliation of our total market capitalization to the estimated fair value of all of our reporting units.\nIf the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its book value, then we are required to perform the second step of the impairment analysis by comparing the carrying amount of the goodwill with its implied fair value. In step two of the analysis, we utilize the fair value of the reporting unit computed in the first step to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. The difference between the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in step one and the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit is the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. Management must also apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of these individual assets and liabilities and may include independent valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets, such as trademarks. Management also evaluates the merits of each significant assumption, both individually and in the aggregate, used to determine the fair values of these individual assets and liabilities. If the carrying amount of our goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess.\nSee further information on the carrying value of goodwill in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate includes the effect of undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States. If there are material changes in our estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements and it becomes apparent that some or all of the undistributed earnings of a subsidiary will need to be remitted in the foreseeable future, but U.S. income taxes have not been recognized by Insight, we would be required to reassess current and future income tax expense attributable to that subsidiary. A determination that we will no longer assert indefinite reinvestment in one or more foreign jurisdictions could affect our assertion on our other foreign entities.\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We consider past operating results, future market growth, forecasted earnings, historical and projected taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and statutory tax law changes in determining the need for a valuation allowance. If we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that all or part of the net deferred tax assets would be realized, then all or part of the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed.\nWe establish liabilities for potentially unfavorable outcomes associated with uncertain tax positions taken on specific tax matters. These liabilities are based on management's assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. There may be differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these matters that may result in subsequent recognition or derecognition of a tax position based on all the available information at the time. If material adjustments are warranted, it could affect our effective tax rate.\nAdditional information about the valuation allowance and uncertain tax positions can be found in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nContingencies\nFrom time to time, we are subject to potential claims and assessments from third parties. We are also subject to various government agency, client and partner audits. We continually assess whether or not such claims have merit and warrant accrual. An accrual is made if it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Such estimates are subject to change and may affect our results of operations and our cash flows. Additional information about contingencies can be found in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table sets forth certain financial data as a percentage of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Costs of goods sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>86.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>86.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>86.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling and administrative expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Severance and restructuring and acquisition-related expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Earnings from operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-operating expense, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Earnings before income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net earnings\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\n2016 Compared to 2015\nNet Sales.

Net sales of hardware and services increased 5% and 10%, respectively, year over year, while net sales of software remained flat year over year. The improvement in net sales in the hardware category was due primarily to higher sales of client devices, servers and storage products. The increase in services net sales reflects the BlueMetal acquisition in October 2015 as well as organic growth in technical services projects. Software net sales during 2016 reflected the continued trend toward higher sales of Cloud-based offerings and a higher mix of software maintenance sales that are recorded on a net sales recognition basis, with net sales equal to the gross profit on the transaction.\nNet sales in EMEA decreased 2%, or $32.6 million, in 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, net sales increased 4% in 2016 compared to 2015. Net sales of services and software were up 15% and 1%, respectively, year over year, while net sales of hardware were down 9% year to year. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, net sales of services, software and hardware increased 22%, 6% and 1%, respectively, year over year. The increase in services net sales was due primarily to increased sales of license consulting services and partner delivered third-party services to new and existing clients across the region. The increase in software net sales in 2016 compared to 2015 was driven by increased volume with large enterprise clients, partially offset by a higher volume of sales of software maintenance and Cloud subscription products that are recorded on a net sales recognition basis.\nNet sales in APAC decreased 2%, or $3.3 million, in 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, net sales in 2016 remained flat compared to 2015. An increase in services and hardware net sales year over year was offset by a decrease in software net sales during 2016 compared to 2015 resulting from a higher volume of sales of software maintenance and Cloud subscription products that are recorded on a net sales recognition basis.\nNet sales by category for North America, EMEA and APAC were as follows for 2016 and 2015:\nTable 147: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>North America </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>EMEA </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>APAC </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales Mix\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hardware\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>62 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Software\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>82 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>89 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Services\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Gross Profit.

The year over year increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to increases in supplier discounts year over year as we took advantage of early pay discounts offered by certain of our partners, which generated a 6 basis point improvement in margin year over year. During 2016, we also recognized a $2.2 million insurance settlement as a reduction of cost of sales due to the nature of the related insured loss previously recorded. The insurance settlement accounted for 6 basis points of the year over year margin expansion during 2016 compared to 2015. Although an increase in higher margin consulting services sales generated a 15 basis point improvement in gross margin year over year, the increase was partially offset by a decline in margin generated by sales of warranty services of 12 basis points year to year.\nEMEA's gross profit remained flat in 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, gross profit was up 7% in 2016 compared to 2015. As a percentage of net sales, gross margin increased by approximately 30 basis points year over year. The year over year increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to a net increase in product margin, which includes partner funding and freight, of 19 basis points during 2016 compared to 2015. The product margin expansion was due primarily to the positive effect on software margin that results from the higher volume of sales that are recorded on a net sales recognition basis within the net sales line item. Changes in the mix and size of transactions and an increase in partner funding earlier in 2016 also contributed to the margin improvement during 2016 compared to 2015. In addition, we recognized a 13 basis point increase in margin resulting from higher fees from enterprise software agreements during 2016 compared to 2015.\nAPAC's gross profit increased 12% in 2016 compared to 2015, with gross margin increasing to 18.2% in 2016 from 16.0% in 2015. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, gross profit increased 14% in 2016 compared to 2015. The improvement in gross margin in 2016 compared to 2015 was due primarily to the positive effect on margin that results from the higher volume of sales that are recorded on a net sales recognition basis, an increase in the mix of higher margin services net sales, higher partner funding and an increase in hardware sales during 2016 compared to 2015.\nOperating Expenses.\nSelling and Administrative Expenses. Selling and administrative expenses increased $337,000 in 2016 compared to 2015. Selling and administrative expenses decreased approximately 20 basis points as a percentage of net sales in 2016 compared to 2015. Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales by operating segment for 2016 and 2015 were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 149: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Net\nSales </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Net\nSales </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> North America\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>401,316 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>396,603 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EMEA\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>160,269 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>165,879 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> APAC\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,658 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,424 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>585,243 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>584,906 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> North America's selling and administrative expenses increased 1%, or $4.7 million, in 2016 compared to 2015, but decreased approximately 30 basis points year to year as a percentage of net sales to 10.1% of net sales in 2016. Teammate benefits expense, including healthcare expenses, increased $6.0 million year over year due to an increase in healthcare claims, and variable compensation increased $4.6 million as a result of the increase in net sales and gross profit year over year. These increases in expenses during 2016 compared to 2015 were partially offset by a decline in the provision for losses on accounts receivable of $3.4 million in 2016 compared to 2015 due to favorable collection results and a decrease in salaries and wages and contract labor of $2.7 million resulting from cost reduction initiatives implemented earlier in 2016 across our North America business. As discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report, our results for 2015 include a non-cash charge of $800,000 to reduce the carrying amount of our real estate held for sale to its estimated fair value less costs to sell.\nWith the acquisition of Datalink on January 6, 2017, we expect to record amortization expense associated with intangible assets acquired from Datalink of approximately $11.5 million in 2017 and $9.2 million in each of 2019 through 2026.\nEMEA's selling and administrative expenses decreased 3%, or $5.6 million, in 2016 compared to 2015, and decreased approximately 10 basis points to 12.0% of net sales in 2016. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, selling and administrative expenses increased 3% compared to the prior year. The increase in expenses (excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates) was primarily driven by increased salaries and wages and teammate benefits expenses attributed to higher average cost per head in conjunction with our investments in sales and services related headcount to support services and Cloud growth across the region.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nAPAC's selling and administrative expenses increased 6%, or $1.2 million, in 2016 compared to 2015, and increased approximately 90 basis points to 13.5% of net sales in 2016. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, selling and administrative expenses increased 7% compared to the prior year. The year over year increase is primarily driven by higher variable compensation as a result of the increase in gross profit year over year and increased selling and administrative expenses as a result of the acquisition of Ignia, a business technology consulting and managed services provider, effective September 1, 2016.\nSeverance and Restructuring Expenses. During 2016, North America, EMEA and APAC recorded severance expense, net of adjustments, totaling $3.0 million, $1.5 million and $118,000, respectively. The North America charges related to a headcount reduction as part of cost reduction initiatives early in 2016 noted previously, while the EMEA charges related to significant restructuring activities, primarily in the United Kingdom, Germany and France, as we worked to reduce our selling and administrative expenses in EMEA. Current period charges were offset by adjustments for changes in estimates of previous accruals as cash payments were made during 2016. During 2015, North America and EMEA recorded severance expense, net of adjustments, totaling $1.1 million and $3.8 million, respectively. APAC did not record any severance expense in 2015. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further discussion of severance and restructuring activities.\nAcquisition-related Expenses. During 2016, we incurred $169,000 in direct third-party transaction costs related to the acquisition of Ignia and $4.3 million in such costs related to the acquisition of Datalink that was completed on January 6, 2017. See Notes 22 and 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further discussion of acquisitions.\nNon-Operating (Income) Expense.\nInterest Income. Interest income for 2016 and 2015 was generated from interest earned on cash and cash equivalent bank balances. The increase in interest income year over year is primarily due to higher interest rates earned on such balances and to higher average interest-bearing cash and cash equivalent balances during 2016.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense primarily relates to borrowings under our financing facilities and imputed interest under our inventory financing facility. Interest expense increased 19% in 2016 compared to 2015 due primarily to higher borrowing rates and higher average daily balances under our debt facilities in 2016 compared to 2015, while imputed interest under our inventory financing facility remained flat from 2015 to 2016 at $3.4 million. For a description of our various financing facilities, see Notes 5 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nNet Foreign Currency Exchange Gains/Losses. These gains/losses result from foreign currency transactions, including foreign currency derivative contracts and intercompany balances that are not considered long-term in nature. The change in net foreign currency exchange gains/losses is due primarily to the underlying changes in the applicable exchange rates, partially mitigated by our use of foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the effects of fluctuations in foreign currencies on certain of our non-functional currency assets and liabilities.\nOther Expense, Net. Other expense, net, consists primarily of bank fees associated with our cash management activities.\nIncome Tax Expense. Our effective tax rate for 2016 was 39.3% compared to 36.4% in 2015. The increase in the tax rate from 2015 to 2016 was primarily due to the effect of a change in tax law that was enacted in December 2016 related to the taxation of foreign currency translation gains or losses arising from qualified business units and the effect of non-deductible acquisition-related expenses incurred in 2016. The effective tax rate in 2016 was higher than the federal statutory rate of 35.0% primarily due to the increases in the valuation allowances in certain foreign jurisdictions and state taxes in the United States as well as the tax law change during the fourth quarter of 2016 and the effect of non-deductible acquisition-related expenses incurred in 2016, as noted previously. These increases in our effective tax rate in 2016 were offset partially by lower taxes on earnings in foreign jurisdictions. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further discussion of income tax expense.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\n2015 Compared to 2014\nNet Sales.

Net sales of hardware, software and services increased 7%, 5% and 20%, respectively, year over year. Net sales in the hardware category were up due to higher sales of client devices and networking and server products to large enterprise and public sector clients, including server sales resulting from the end of life of Microsoft Windows Server 2003 and the completion of a number of multi-quarter network deployments during 2015. Software sales comparisons reflect growth driven from stronger demand for business productivity and security solutions, particularly in the public sector, where we added new clients and continued to grow our existing portfolio in 2015. Services sales improved with additional consulting services engagements and technical deployments performed during 2015, reflecting the benefits of expanding our solutions capabilities, including the acquisition of BlueMetal in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nNet sales in EMEA decreased 11%, or $168.8 million, in U.S. dollars, in 2015 compared to 2014. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, net sales increased 2% in 2015 compared to 2014. Net sales of services were up 9% year over year, while net sales of hardware and software were down 7% and 14%, respectively, in 2015 compared to 2014. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, net sales of services, hardware and software increased 24%, 2% and 1%, respectively, year over year. The increase in services net sales was due primarily to increased sales of Cloud solutions and third-party services to new and existing clients across the region. The increase in hardware net sales (excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates) was due primarily to higher volume in sales with our corporate and public sector clients, with year over year growth most notably in the server hardware category. The increase in software net sales (excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates) was driven by higher volume with our public sector and service provider clients, primarily for business productivity solutions, earlier in 2015, offset by the effect of certain large software transactions in the fourth quarter of 2014 that did not recur in 2015.\nNet sales in APAC decreased 16%, or $35.1 million, in 2015 compared to 2014. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, net sales decreased 5% in 2015 compared to 2014 due to lower volume as a result of a softer economy and a higher mix of software maintenance sales, which are recorded on a net sales recognition basis.\nNet sales by category for North America, EMEA and APAC were as follows for 2015 and 2014:\nTable 151: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>North America </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>EMEA </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>APAC </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales Mix\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hardware\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Software\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>89 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Services\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nGross Profit.

The decline in gross margin was due primarily to a 21 basis point decrease in margin contributed by agency fees from enterprise software agreements due primarily to partner program changes and a 20 basis point decrease in product margin, which includes partner funding and freight. The decrease in product margin reflects a higher mix of device sales to large enterprise and public sector clients at lower margins, as well as the negative effect on the year over year comparison of a reduction in costs of goods sold in 2014 of approximately $4.1 million associated with the settlement or recovery of previously disputed sales tax amounts during 2014. These decreases in margin were partially offset by a 17 basis point increase in sales of higher margin services in 2015 compared to 2014.\nEMEA's gross profit decreased 7% in 2015 compared to 2014. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, gross profit in 2015 was up 6% compared to 2014. As a percentage of net sales, gross margin increased by approximately 60 basis points year over year. The increase in gross margin was due primarily to a 49 basis point increase in product margin, which includes partner funding and freight, and a 12 basis point increase in sales of higher margin services. The primary driver of the increase in product margin during 2015 compared to 2014 was the favorable effect of certain large, low margin software transactions in 2014 that did not recur in 2015.\nAPAC's gross profit decreased 19% in 2015 compared to 2014. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, gross profit in 2015 decreased 7% compared to 2014. As a percentage of net sales, gross margin decreased by approximately 40 basis points, due primarily to a 69 basis point decrease in margin driven by lower fees from enterprise software agreements resulting from partner program changes. This decrease in margin was partially offset by a 21 basis point increase in sales of higher margin services in 2015 compared to 2014.\nOperating Expenses.\nSelling and Administrative Expenses. Selling and administrative expenses increased 1%, or $7.9 million, in 2015 compared to 2014. Selling and administrative expenses increased approximately 10 basis points as a percentage of net sales in 2015 compared to 2014.

As discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report, our results for 2015 and 2014 include non-cash charges of $800,000 and $5.2 million, respectively, to reduce the carrying amount of our owned real estate in Bloomingdale, Illinois that was held for sale to its estimated fair value less costs to sell. Additionally, salaries and wages and contract labor increased $15.2 million year over year due to investments in sales and services personnel, variable compensation increased approximately $6.3 million year over year as a result of improved net sales and gross profit performance and teammate-related expenses increased $2.5 million year over year due primarily to an increase in healthcare benefit costs due to increased claims under self-insured programs.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nEMEA's selling and administrative expenses decreased 7%, or $12.9 million, in 2015 compared to 2014, but, as a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses increased approximately 50 basis points to 12.1% of net sales in 2015. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, selling and administrative expenses increased 5% in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase was primarily driven by higher salaries and wages from investments in sales and services related headcount to support services and Cloud growth across the region.\nAPAC's selling and administrative expenses decreased 11%, or $2.8 million, in 2015 compared to 2014, but, as a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses increased approximately 80 basis points to 12.6% of net sales in 2015. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, selling and administrative expenses increased 3% compared to the prior year. The increase from 2014 to 2015 is primarily driven by higher salaries and wages and from an increase in teammate-related expenses, partially offset by lower variable compensation based on net sales and gross profit performance in 2015 compared to 2014.\nSeverance and Restructuring Expenses. During 2015, North America and EMEA recorded severance expense, net of adjustments, totaling $1.1 million and $3.8 million, respectively, related to a continued review of resource needs in North America and additional restructuring activities in EMEA. In North America and EMEA, $1.5 million and $4.0 million, respectively, in new severance costs were offset by $418,000 and $182,000, respectively, of adjustments to prior severance accruals due to changes in estimates during 2015. During 2014, North America, EMEA and APAC recorded severance expense, net of adjustments, totaling $971,000, $3.4 million and $106,000, respectively. In North America and EMEA, $1.5 million and $3.9 million, respectively, in new severance costs were offset by $492,000 and $531,000, respectively, of adjustments to prior severance accruals due to changes in estimates during 2014. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further discussion of severance and restructuring activities.\nNon-Operating (Income) Expense.\nInterest Income. Interest income for 2015 and 2014 was generated from interest earned on cash and cash equivalent bank balances. The decrease in interest income from 2014 to 2015 is primarily due to lower average interest-bearing cash and cash equivalent balances and lower interest rates earned on such balances during 2015.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense primarily relates to borrowings under our financing facilities and imputed interest under our inventory financing facility. Interest expense increased 20% in 2015 compared to 2014 due primarily to higher average daily balances under our inventory financing facility in 2015 compared to 2014, resulting in an increase in imputed interest under the facility from $2.4 million in 2014 to $3.4 million in 2015. For a description of our various financing facilities, see Notes 5 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nNet Foreign Currency Exchange Gains/Losses. These gains/losses result from foreign currency transactions, including foreign currency derivative contracts and intercompany balances that are not considered long-term in nature. The change in net foreign currency exchange gains/losses is due primarily to the underlying changes in the applicable exchange rates, partially mitigated by our use of foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the effects of fluctuations in foreign currencies on certain of our non-functional currency assets and liabilities.\nOther Expense, Net. Other expense, net, consists primarily of bank fees associated with our cash management activities.\nIncome Tax Expense. Our effective tax rate for 2015 was 36.4% compared to 39.1% in 2014. The decrease in the tax rate from 2014 to 2015 was primarily due to reduced losses in certain foreign jurisdictions in 2015, resulting in less of an increase in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets related to these foreign operating losses. The effective tax rate in 2015 was higher than the federal statutory rate of 35.0% primarily due to state taxes in the United States as well as the increases in the valuation allowances in certain foreign jurisdictions. These increases in our effective tax rate in 2015 were offset partially by lower taxes on earnings in foreign jurisdictions. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further discussion of income tax expense.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table sets forth certain consolidated cash flow information for 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):\nTable 154: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>95,805 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>180,510 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>110,319 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21,185 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(57,637 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,511 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(57,907 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(82,736 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(48,530 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Foreign currency exchange effect on cash and cash equivalent balances\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,809 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16,683 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16,571 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,904 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,454 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,707 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>187,978 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>164,524 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>126,817 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents at end of year\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>202,882 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>187,978 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>164,524 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Cash and Cash Flow\nOur primary uses of cash during 2016 were to fund working capital requirements, repurchase shares of our common stock, pay down our debt balances, fund capital expenditures and acquire Ignia. Operating activities provided $95.8 million in cash in 2016. Both the 2016 and 2015 results are affected by individually significant transactions at each year end, whereby a single significant receivable was collected from a client in the fourth quarter of the year for which the related payment to the supplier was due and paid in January of the following year, as discussed in more detail below. During 2016, we repurchased $50.0 million of our common stock, made net combined repayments on our long-term debt facilities of $49.5 million and acquired Ignia for $10.8 million, net of cash acquired. Capital expenditures were $12.3 million in 2016, a 9% decrease from 2015, reflecting lower IT investments year to year. Cash and cash equivalent balances in 2016 and 2015 were negatively affected by $1.8 million and $16.7 million, respectively, as a result of foreign currency exchange rates.\nWe anticipate that cash flows from operations, together with the funds available under our financing facilities, will be adequate to support our presently anticipated cash and working capital requirements for operations as well as other strategic investments over the next 12 months. We currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate any foreign undistributed earnings. We expect existing domestic cash and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating cash activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as capital expenditures and debt repayments, for at least the next 12 months.\nNet cash provided by operating activities. Cash flows from operating activities reflect our net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items such as depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense and write-offs and write-downs of assets, as well as changes in asset and liability balances. In 2016, the increases in accounts receivable and accounts payable reflect increased sales and associated costs of goods sold, respectively, in 2016 compared to 2015. However, the 2016 results are also affected by a single significant receivable collected from a client in the fourth quarter of 2016 for which the related payment to the supplier of approximately $160 million was due and paid in January 2017, as noted previously. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we had a similar experience with a significant receivable collected in the quarter for which the payment to the supplier of approximately $60 million was not made until the first quarter of 2016. Excluding the effects of these two individually significant timing differences, cash flow from operations would have been nominal for 2016. Additionally, the increase in accounts payable reflected as cash provided by operating activities in 2016 is affected by the increased use of our inventory financing facility in 2016 to facilitate the purchase of inventory from various suppliers. Increases in accounts payable under this facility are reflected as cash provided by financing activities, as discussed below. Had these purchases been made without using the inventory financing facility during 2016, the net borrowings under our inventory financing facility of $48.6 million that are reflected as cash flows from financing activities would have been reflected as an increase in accounts payable, which would be an increase in cash provided by operating activities. We used more working capital in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, as our sales growth was weighted to the last two months of the current year. The $50.1 million increase in other assets was primarily a result of our deferral of costs for certain payments made or payable to partners at December 31, 2016, in advance of our being able to recognize the related revenue. The $28.9 million increase in inventories was primarily attributable to an increase in inventory levels at December 31, 2016, to support specific client engagements and hardware sale transactions in transit to clients as of December 31, 2016 such that delivery was not deemed to have occurred until the product was received by the client in early January 2017.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nIn 2015, the increases in accounts receivable and accounts payable reflect increased sales and associated costs of goods sold, respectively, in 2015 compared to 2014. However, the 2015 results are also affected by the single significant receivable collected from a client in the fourth quarter of 2015 for which the related payment to the supplier of approximately $60 million was due and paid in January 2016, as noted previously. The increase in other assets was primarily a result of our deferral of costs for certain payments made or payable to partners at December 31, 2015, in advance of our being able to recognize the related revenue. As a result, cash flows from operating activities in 2015 exceeded our historical average annual cash flow generation of $80 million to $120 million.\nIn 2014, the increases in accounts receivable and accounts payable reflect increased sales and associated costs of goods sold, respectively, in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase in inventories is primarily attributable to an increase in inventory levels at December 31, 2014, to support specific client engagements and hardware sale transactions in transit to clients as of December 31, 2014 such that delivery was not deemed to have occurred until the product was received by the client in early January 2015. The decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities in 2014 was primarily due to the relative timing of sales tax and VAT payments in 2014 compared to 2013.\nOur consolidated cash flow operating metrics for the quarters ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 are as follows:\nTable 155: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Days sales outstanding in ending accounts receivable (\u201cDSOs\u201d) (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>87 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>83 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Days inventory outstanding (\u201cDIOs\u201d) (b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Days purchases outstanding in ending accounts payable (\u201cDPOs\u201d) (c)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(88 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(77 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(68 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash conversion cycle (days) (d)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 156: <table> <tr> <td>(a) </td> <td>Calculated as the balance of accounts receivable, net at the end of the period divided by daily net sales.

Although the payment to the supplier was not due until after year-end, we collected on the accounts receivable from the client in the fourth quarter of 2016 under normal credit terms. Both the 2016 and 2015 results are affected by individually significant transactions at each year end; however, the magnitude of the 2016 transaction had a greater effect on DPOs. The computation of DPOs for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 includes a payable to a supplier of $160 million, and the computation of DPOs for the quarter ended December 30, 2015 includes a payable to a supplier of $60 million, both of which do not have corresponding accounts receivable outstanding as of the respective period ends.\nOur cash conversion cycle was 20 days in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of four days from the fourth quarter of 2014, due primarily to an increase in DPOs in North America driven by a single significant payment to a supplier that was due and paid in January 2016, after the resolution of certain invoicing issues with the supplier. Although we did not pay the supplier until after year-end, we collected on the accounts receivable from the client in the fourth quarter of 2015 under normal credit terms.\nOur cash conversion cycle was 24 days in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2014, an improvement of three days from the fourth quarter of 2013, due primarily to higher DPOs in North America driven by the timing of payments to suppliers during the quarter ended December 31, 2014 offset by a one day increase in DIOs due to the increase in inventories discussed above.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nWe expect that cash flow from operations will be used, at least partially, to fund working capital as we typically pay our partners on average terms that are shorter than the average terms we grant to our clients in order to take advantage of supplier discounts. We intend to use cash generated in 2017 in excess of working capital needs to support our capital expenditures for the year and to pay down our debt balances. We also may use cash to fund potential acquisitions to add select capabilities.\nNet cash used in investing activities. Capital expenditures of $12.3 million, $13.4 million and $10.0 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, were primarily related to technology and facility enhancements. We expect total capital expenditures in 2017 to be between $15.0 million and $20.0 million, primarily for technology-related upgrade projects and integration of acquisitions.\nDuring 2016, we acquired Ignia for $10.8 million, net of cash acquired, and during 2015, we acquired BlueMetal for $44.2 million, net of cash acquired.\nNet cash used in financing activities. During 2016, we made net combined repayments on our long-term debt under our revolving facility and our accounts receivable securitization facility (\u201cABS facility\u201d) of $49.5 million and had net borrowings under our inventory financing facility of $48.6 million. In 2016, we also funded $50.0 million of repurchases of our common stock. During 2015, we had net combined borrowings on our long-term debt under our revolving facility and our ABS facility of $28.0 million and made net repayments under our inventory financing facility of $16.5 million. In 2015, we also funded $91.8 million of repurchases of our common stock. During 2014, we had net combined repayments on our long-term debt under our revolving facility and our ABS facility of $5.5 million and had net borrowings under our inventory financing facility of $7.5 million. In 2014, we also funded $50.4 million of repurchases of our common stock.\nFinancing Facilities\nOn June 23, 2016, we entered into amendments to our revolving facility, our ABS facility and our inventory financing facility.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our long-term debt balance consisted of $39.5 million outstanding under our $250.0 million ABS facility and no amounts outstanding under our $350.0 million revolving facility. As of December 31, 2016, the current portion of our long-term debt relates solely to our capital lease obligations. Our objective is to pay our debt balances down while retaining adequate cash balances to meet overall business objectives.\nOn January 6, 2017, we funded the acquisition of Datalink through a combination of cash on hand and approximately $196.0 million in borrowings under our revolving facility. In conjunction with the acquisition, we amended our revolving facility to expand the facility by $175.0 million in the form of a Term Loan A that requires amortization payments in years one through five. We anticipate that these additional borrowings will increase our 2017 interest expense by approximately $6 million compared to interest expense incurred in 2016 and will require additional cash to fund interest and amortization payments over the term of the loan. See Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a description of our amendment to our revolving facility in conjunction with our acquisition of Datalink.\nWhile the ABS facility has a stated maximum amount, the actual availability under the ABS facility is limited by the quantity and quality of the underlying accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2016, qualified receivables were sufficient to permit access to the full $250.0 million under the ABS facility.\nOur consolidated debt balance that can be outstanding at the end of any fiscal quarter under our revolving facility and our ABS facility is limited by certain financial covenants, particularly a maximum leverage ratio. The maximum leverage ratio is calculated as aggregate debt outstanding divided by the sum of the Company's trailing twelve month net earnings (loss) plus (i) interest expense, excluding non-cash imputed interest on our inventory financing facility, (ii) income tax expense (benefit), (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) non-cash stock-based compensation, (v) extraordinary or non-recurring non-cash losses or expenses and (vi) certain cash restructuring and acquisition-related charges, not to exceed specified caps (\u201cadjusted earnings\u201d). The maximum leverage ratio permitted under the facilities was increased from 2.75 times to 3.00 times trailing twelve-month adjusted earnings in conjunction with the amendments to the facilities in June 2016 and may increase to 3.50 times trailing twelve-month adjusted earnings in certain circumstances. The maximum ratio was increased in conjunction with the acquisition of Datalink in January 2017. See Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. We anticipate that we will be in compliance with our maximum leverage ratio requirements over the next four quarters. However, a significant drop in the Company's adjusted earnings would limit the amount of indebtedness that could be outstanding at the end of any fiscal quarter to a level that would be below the Company's consolidated maximum facility amounts. Based on the maximum permitted leverage ratio as of December 31, 2016, the Company's debt balance that could have been outstanding under our revolving facility and our ABS facility was the full amount of the maximum borrowing capacity of $600.0 million.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nOur revolving facility and our ABS facility contain various covenants customary for transactions of this type, including limitations on the payment of dividends and the requirement that we comply with maximum leverage and minimum fixed charge ratio requirements, comply with a minimum receivable requirement and meet monthly, quarterly and annual reporting requirements. If we fail to comply with these covenants, the lenders would be able to demand payment within a specified time period. At December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all such covenants. Further, the terms of the ABS facility identify various circumstances that would result in an \u201camortization event\u201d under the facility. At December 31, 2016, no such \u201camortization event\u201d had occurred.\nWe also have an agreement with a financial intermediary to facilitate the purchase of inventory from various suppliers under certain terms and conditions. These amounts are classified separately as accounts payable - inventory financing facility in our consolidated balance sheets.\nThe aggregate availability for vendor purchases under our inventory financing facility is $325,000,000. From time to time and at our option, we may request to increase the aggregate amount available under the inventory financing facility by up to an aggregate of $25,000,000, subject to customary conditions. The facility matures on June 23, 2021. Additionally, the facility may be renewed under certain circumstances described in the agreement for successive 12-month periods. Interest does not accrue on accounts payable under this facility provided the accounts payable are paid within stated vendor terms (ranging from 30 to 60 days).\nNotes 5 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report also include: a description of our financing facilities; amounts outstanding; amounts available and weighted average borrowings and interest rates during the year.\nUndistributed Foreign Earnings\nCash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation upon repatriation to the United States. We do not provide for U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of those of our foreign subsidiaries where earnings are reinvested and, in the opinion of management, will continue to be reinvested indefinitely outside of the United States. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $179.9 million in cash and cash equivalents in certain of our foreign subsidiaries where we consider undistributed earnings of these foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested. As of December 31, 2016, the majority of our foreign cash resides in the Netherlands, Canada, Australia, Russia and the United Kingdom. Certain of these cash balances will be remitted to the United States by paying down intercompany payables generated in the ordinary course of business. This repayment would not change our policy to indefinitely reinvest earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are deemed to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States were approximately $105.3 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $88.9 million at the end of 2015. We intend to use undistributed earnings for general business purposes in the foreign jurisdictions as well as to fund our capital expenditures and potential acquisitions.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have entered into off-balance sheet arrangements, which include guaranties and indemnifications. These arrangements are discussed in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. We believe that none of our off-balance sheet arrangements have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition, sales or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nContractual Obligations\nAt December 31, 2016, our contractual obligations for continuing operations were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 160: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments due by period </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than\n1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3\nYears </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5\nYears </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More than\n5 Years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital lease obligations, including interest payments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,324 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>542 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>782 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Inventory financing facility (b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>154,930 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>154,930 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations (c)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66,555 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,571 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,810 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,666 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,508 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Severance and restructuring obligations (d)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,164 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,164 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other contractual obligations (e)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,038 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,959 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,936 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,128 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>273,511 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>174,166 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>68,028 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,681 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,636 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 161: <table> <tr> <td>(a) </td> <td>Reflects the $39.5 million outstanding at December 31, 2016 under our ABS facility as due in June 2019, the date at which the facility matures.

The magnitude, timing and nature of any future acquisitions or investments will depend on a number of factors, including the availability of suitable candidates, the negotiation of acceptable terms, our financial capabilities and general economic and business conditions. Financing for future transactions would result in the utilization of cash, incurrence of additional debt, issuance of stock or some combination of the three. See Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a discussion of our acquisition of Datalink on January 6, 2017 and the amendment to our revolving facility to fund, in part, the acquisition.\nInflation\nWe have historically not been adversely affected by inflation, as technological advances and competition within the IT industry have generally caused the prices of the products we sell to decline and product life cycles tend to be short. This requires our growth in unit sales to exceed the decline in prices in order to increase our net sales. We believe that most price increases could be passed on to our clients, as prices charged by us are not set by long-term contracts; however, as a result of competitive pressure, there can be no assurance that the full effect of any such price increases could be passed on to our clients.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nThe information contained in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report concerning a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including our expected dates of adoption and the estimated effects on our results of operations and financial condition, is incorporated by reference herein.\nTable 169: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7 of this report.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of this report. Our actual results could differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A and elsewhere in this report.\nOverview\nWe are a Fortune 500-ranked global provider of IT hardware, software, Cloud and service solutions to business, government, healthcare and educational clients in North America; Europe, the Middle East, Africa (\u201cEMEA\u201d); and Asia-Pacific (\u201cAPAC\u201d). Our offerings in North America and select countries in EMEA and APAC include hardware, software and services. Our offerings in the remainder of our EMEA and APAC segments are largely software and select software-related services.\nFull year 2016 financial and operational highlights included the following:\n \u2022 In North America: \n \u2022 We successfully completed the integration of BlueMetal into the business, which helped drive double-digit growth in services sales for the full year; \n \u2022 We gained hardware market share from competitors according to third party data; and \n \u2022 We continued to help clients assess and migrate to the Cloud, either through hybrid Cloud/data center solutions or public Cloud alternatives. \n \u2022 In EMEA: \n \u2022 We executed well in the core business, growing earnings from operations by 44% year over year, while continuing to transform to a Cloud and solutions company; and \n \u2022 We believe that we led the market in Cloud adoption with our largest software partner in EMEA. \n \u2022 In APAC: \n \u2022 We continued to diversify our business mix by increasing our hardware and services sales across the region; and \n \u2022 We acquired Ignia in the third quarter as part of our continuing efforts to deliver value-added services globally to our clients. \nOn a consolidated basis, for the year ended December 31, 2016, our net sales of $5.5 billion increased 2% compared to 2015, up 4% year over year excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. Our resulting gross profit also increased by 4%, or $26.8 million, compared to 2015, up 6% year over year excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. Consolidated gross margin improved approximately 20 basis points to 13.5% of net sales in 2016. Selling and administrative expenses remained flat, increasing $337,000 in 2016 compared to 2015. We reported earnings from operations of $148.8 million in 2016, an increase of 18% compared to the prior year, which represented 2.7% of net sales, compared to 2.4% in the prior year. Our effective tax rate in 2016 was 39.3% compared to 36.4% in 2015 and 39.1% in 2014. Net earnings and diluted net earnings per share were $84.7 million and $2.32, respectively, in 2016. In 2015, we reported net earnings of $75.9 million and diluted net earnings per share of $1.98. In 2014, we reported net earnings of $75.7 million and diluted net earnings per share of $1.83.\nThe results of operations for 2016 include the following items:\n \u2022 the acquisition of Ignia effective September 1, 2016; \n \u2022 transaction costs totaling $4.4 million, $4.2 million net of tax, associated with the acquisitions of Ignia and Datalink; \n \u2022 severance and restructuring expenses of $4.6 million, $3.3 million net of tax; \n \u2022 a gain of $338,000 on the sale of our Bloomingdale, Illinois real estate; and \n \u2022 the repurchase of approximately 1.9 million shares of the Company's common stock for $50 million. \nThe results of operations for 2016 do not include the results of Datalink, as the acquisition did not close until January 6, 2017.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nThe results of operations for 2015 include the following items:\n \u2022 the acquisition of BlueMetal effective October 1, 2015; \n \u2022 severance and restructuring expenses of $4.9 million, $4.3 million net of tax; \n \u2022 an impairment loss of $800,000 to further reduce the carrying amount of our previously owned real estate in Bloomingdale, Illinois to its estimated fair value less costs to sell; and \n \u2022 the repurchase of approximately 3.3 million shares of the Company's common stock for $91.8 million. \nThe results of operations for 2014 include the following items:\n \u2022 severance and restructuring expenses of $4.4 million, $3.7 million net of tax; \n \u2022 an impairment loss of $4.6 million and accelerated depreciation of $620,000 to reduce the carrying amount of our previously owned real estate in Bloomingdale, Illinois to its estimated fair value less costs to sell; \n \u2022 a reduction in costs of goods sold of approximately $4.1 million associated with the settlement or recovery of previously disputed sales tax amounts; \n \u2022 a reduction in selling and administrative expenses to recognize a $895,000 gain upon our sale of certain real estate to a related party; and \n \u2022 the repurchase of approximately 2.1 million shares of the Company's common stock for $50.4 million. \nThroughout the \u201cOverview\u201d and \u201cResults of Operations\u201d sections of \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d we refer to changes in net sales, gross profit, selling and administrative expenses and earnings from operations on a consolidated basis and in North America, EMEA and APAC excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. In computing these amounts and percentages, we compare the current period amount as translated into U.S. dollars under the applicable accounting standards to the prior period amount in local currency translated into U.S. dollars utilizing the weighted average translation rate for the current period.\nNet of tax amounts referenced above were computed using the statutory tax rate for the taxing jurisdictions in the operating segment in which the related expenses were recorded, adjusted for the effects of valuation allowances on net operating losses in certain jurisdictions.\nDuring 2016, we generated $95.8 million of cash flows from operations, we repurchased $50 million of our common stock and utilized approximately $10.8 million, net of cash acquired, to fund the acquisition of Ignia. We ended the year with $202.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and $39.5 million of debt outstanding under our long-term debt facilities.\nDuring 2016, we amended our revolving facility and our ABS facility and increased the combined maximum borrowing capacity available to us by $50 million and extended the maturity dates of the agreement to 2021 and 2019, respectively. In addition, we amended our inventory financing facility and increased the maximum capacity available to us under that facility by $75 million and extended the maturity date to 2021.\nDetails about segment results of operations can be found in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nOur discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist in the understanding of our consolidated financial statements, including the changes in certain key items in those consolidated financial statements from year to year and the primary factors that contributed to those changes, as well as how certain critical accounting estimates affect our consolidated financial statements.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nGeneral\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). For a summary of significant accounting policies, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results, however, may differ from our estimates. Members of our senior management have discussed the critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.\nWe consider the following to be our critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:\nSales Recognition\nSales are recognized when title and risk of loss are passed to the client, there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement for sale, delivery has occurred and/or services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Our standard sales terms are F.O.B. shipping point or equivalent, at which time title and risk of loss have passed to the client. However, because we either (i) have a general practice of covering client losses while products are in transit despite title and risk of loss contractually transferring at the point of shipment or (ii) have specifically stated F.O.B. destination contractual terms with the client, delivery is not deemed to have occurred until the point in time when the product is received by the client.\nWe leverage drop-shipment arrangements with many of our partners and suppliers to deliver products to our clients without having to physically hold the inventory at our warehouses, thereby increasing efficiency and reducing costs. We recognize revenue for drop-shipment arrangements on a gross basis when the product is received by the client. We recognize revenue on a gross basis as the principal in the transaction because we control the transaction as the primary obligor for product fulfillment in the arrangement, we assume inventory risk if the product is returned by the client, we set the price of the product charged to the client, we assume credit risk for the amounts invoiced, and we work closely with our clients to determine their hardware and software specifications.\nWe make provisions for estimated product returns that we expect to occur under our return policy based upon historical return rates. Our manufacturers warrant most of the products we market, and it is our policy to request that clients return their defective products directly to the manufacturer for warranty service during the manufacturer's warranty period. On selected products, and for selected client service reasons, we may accept returns directly from the client and then either credit the client or ship a replacement product. We generally offer a limited 15- to 30-day return policy for unopened products and certain opened products, which are consistent with manufacturers' terms; however, for some products we may charge restocking fees. Products returned opened are processed and returned to the manufacturer or partner for repair, replacement or credit to us. Subject to some manufacturers' restrictions, certain products cannot be returned to the manufacturer for warranty processing. We resell most unopened products returned to us. If we accept a return from a client that we cannot return to the partner, we try to mitigate our losses by selling to inventory liquidators, to end users as \u201cpreviously sold\u201d or \u201cused\u201d products, or through other channels.\nRevenue is recognized from software sales when clients acquire the right to use or copy software under license, but in no case prior to the commencement of the term of the initial software license agreement, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met (i.e., evidence of the arrangement exists, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility of the fee is probable).\nWe sell certain third-party service contracts and software maintenance and Cloud or software-as-a-service subscription products for which we are not the primary obligor. These sales do not meet the criteria for gross sales recognition and, thus, are recorded on a net sales recognition basis. As we enter into contracts with third-party service providers or vendors and our clients, we evaluate whether the subsequent sales of such services should be recorded as gross sales or net sales. We determine whether we act as a principal in the transaction and assume the risks and rewards of ownership or if we are simply acting as an agent or broker. Under gross sales recognition, the selling price is recorded in sales and our cost to the third-party service provider or vendor is recorded in costs of goods sold. Under net sales recognition, the cost to the third-party service provider or vendor is recorded as a reduction to sales, resulting in net sales equal to the gross profit on the transaction, and there are no costs of goods sold.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nWe recognize revenue for sales of services ratably over the time period over which the service will be provided if there is no discernible pattern of recognition of the cost to perform the service. Billings for such services that are made in advance of the related revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the billing coverage period. Revenue from certain arrangements that allow for the use of a product or service over a period of time without taking possession of software are also accounted for ratably over the time period over which the service will be provided.\nWe recognize revenue for professional services engagements that are on a time and materials basis based upon hours incurred as the services are performed and amounts are earned. Net sales for these service engagements are not a significant portion of our consolidated net sales.\nAdditionally, we sell certain professional services contracts on a fixed fee basis. Revenues for fixed fee professional services contracts are recognized based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs. Net sales for these service contracts are not a significant portion of our consolidated net sales.\nIn certain arrangements, we may provide a combination of hardware and software products and the provision of services. Services that are performed by us in conjunction with hardware and software sales that are completed in our facilities prior to shipment of the product are recognized upon delivery, when title passes to the client, for the hardware sale. Net sales of services that are performed at client locations are primarily service-only contracts and are recorded as sales when the services are performed. The total consideration for an arrangement with multiple deliverables is allocated to all deliverables that represent a separate unit of accounting using the relative selling price method.\nPartner Funding\nWe receive payments and credits from partners, including consideration pursuant to volume sales incentive programs, volume purchase incentive programs and shared marketing expense programs. Partner funding received pursuant to volume sales incentive programs is recognized as it is earned as a reduction to costs of goods sold. Partner funding received pursuant to volume purchase incentive programs is allocated as a reduction to inventories based on the applicable incentives earned from each partner and is recorded in costs of goods sold as the related inventory is sold. Partner funding received pursuant to shared marketing expense programs is recorded as it is earned as a reduction of the related selling and administrative expenses in the period the program takes place if the consideration represents a reimbursement of specific, incremental, identifiable costs. Consideration that exceeds the specific, incremental, identifiable costs is classified as a reduction of costs of goods sold. Changes in estimates of anticipated achievement levels under individual partner programs could have a material effect on our results of operations and our cash flows.\nSee Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further discussion of our accounting policies related to partner funding.\nValuation of Long-Lived Assets Including Purchased Intangible Assets and Goodwill\nWe review property, plant and equipment and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. If such events or changes in circumstances indicate a possible impairment, our asset impairment review assesses the recoverability of the assets based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or the asset group plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset or the asset group (if any) and compares that value to the carrying value. Such impairment test is based on the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between fair value and the carrying amount. This approach uses our estimates of future market growth, forecasted net sales and costs, expected periods the assets will be utilized and appropriate discount rates.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nWe perform an annual review of our goodwill in the fourth quarter of every year and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. We continually assess whether any indicators of impairment exist, and that assessment requires a significant amount of judgment. Events or circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, unanticipated competition, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business, significant negative industry or economic trends, significant declines in our stock price for a sustained period or significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future cash flows or results of operations. Any adverse change in these factors, among others, could have a significant effect on the recoverability of goodwill and could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nThe goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a \u201ccomponent\u201d). A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and management of the segment regularly reviews the operating results of that component. When two or more components of an operating segment have similar economic characteristics, the components may be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit. An operating segment shall be deemed to be a reporting unit if all of its components are similar, if none of its components is a reporting unit, or if the segment comprises only a single component. Insight has three reporting units, which are equivalent to our operating segments.\nWe may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If it is concluded that this is the case, it is necessary to perform a quantitative two-step goodwill impairment test. Otherwise, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. In completing a quantitative test for a potential impairment of goodwill, we first compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its book value, including goodwill. Management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of our reporting units. Multiple valuation techniques can be used to assess the fair value of the reporting unit, including the market and income approaches. All of these techniques include the use of estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value or goodwill impairment, or both. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to, an appropriate control premium in excess of the market capitalization of the Company, future market growth, forecasted sales and costs and appropriate discount rates. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates. Management evaluates the merits of each significant assumption, both individually and in the aggregate, used to determine the fair value of the reporting units. If the estimated fair value exceeds book value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary. To ensure the reasonableness of the estimated fair values of our reporting units, we perform a reconciliation of our total market capitalization to the estimated fair value of all of our reporting units.\nIf the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its book value, then we are required to perform the second step of the impairment analysis by comparing the carrying amount of the goodwill with its implied fair value. In step two of the analysis, we utilize the fair value of the reporting unit computed in the first step to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. The difference between the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in step one and the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit is the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. Management must also apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of these individual assets and liabilities and may include independent valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets, such as trademarks. Management also evaluates the merits of each significant assumption, both individually and in the aggregate, used to determine the fair values of these individual assets and liabilities. If the carrying amount of our goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess.\nSee further information on the carrying value of goodwill in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate includes the effect of undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States. If there are material changes in our estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements and it becomes apparent that some or all of the undistributed earnings of a subsidiary will need to be remitted in the foreseeable future, but U.S. income taxes have not been recognized by Insight, we would be required to reassess current and future income tax expense attributable to that subsidiary. A determination that we will no longer assert indefinite reinvestment in one or more foreign jurisdictions could affect our assertion on our other foreign entities.\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We consider past operating results, future market growth, forecasted earnings, historical and projected taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and statutory tax law changes in determining the need for a valuation allowance. If we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that all or part of the net deferred tax assets would be realized, then all or part of the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed.\nWe establish liabilities for potentially unfavorable outcomes associated with uncertain tax positions taken on specific tax matters. These liabilities are based on management's assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. There may be differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these matters that may result in subsequent recognition or derecognition of a tax position based on all the available information at the time. If material adjustments are warranted, it could affect our effective tax rate.\nAdditional information about the valuation allowance and uncertain tax positions can be found in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nContingencies\nFrom time to time, we are subject to potential claims and assessments from third parties. We are also subject to various government agency, client and partner audits. We continually assess whether or not such claims have merit and warrant accrual. An accrual is made if it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Such estimates are subject to change and may affect our results of operations and our cash flows. Additional information about contingencies can be found in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table sets forth certain financial data as a percentage of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Costs of goods sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>86.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>86.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>86.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling and administrative expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Severance and restructuring and acquisition-related expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Earnings from operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-operating expense, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Earnings before income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net earnings\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\n2016 Compared to 2015\nNet Sales.

Net sales of hardware and services increased 5% and 10%, respectively, year over year, while net sales of software remained flat year over year. The improvement in net sales in the hardware category was due primarily to higher sales of client devices, servers and storage products. The increase in services net sales reflects the BlueMetal acquisition in October 2015 as well as organic growth in technical services projects. Software net sales during 2016 reflected the continued trend toward higher sales of Cloud-based offerings and a higher mix of software maintenance sales that are recorded on a net sales recognition basis, with net sales equal to the gross profit on the transaction.\nNet sales in EMEA decreased 2%, or $32.6 million, in 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, net sales increased 4% in 2016 compared to 2015. Net sales of services and software were up 15% and 1%, respectively, year over year, while net sales of hardware were down 9% year to year. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, net sales of services, software and hardware increased 22%, 6% and 1%, respectively, year over year. The increase in services net sales was due primarily to increased sales of license consulting services and partner delivered third-party services to new and existing clients across the region. The increase in software net sales in 2016 compared to 2015 was driven by increased volume with large enterprise clients, partially offset by a higher volume of sales of software maintenance and Cloud subscription products that are recorded on a net sales recognition basis.\nNet sales in APAC decreased 2%, or $3.3 million, in 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, net sales in 2016 remained flat compared to 2015. An increase in services and hardware net sales year over year was offset by a decrease in software net sales during 2016 compared to 2015 resulting from a higher volume of sales of software maintenance and Cloud subscription products that are recorded on a net sales recognition basis.\nNet sales by category for North America, EMEA and APAC were as follows for 2016 and 2015:\nTable 147: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>North America </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>EMEA </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>APAC </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales Mix\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hardware\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>62 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Software\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>82 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>89 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Services\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Gross Profit.

The year over year increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to increases in supplier discounts year over year as we took advantage of early pay discounts offered by certain of our partners, which generated a 6 basis point improvement in margin year over year. During 2016, we also recognized a $2.2 million insurance settlement as a reduction of cost of sales due to the nature of the related insured loss previously recorded. The insurance settlement accounted for 6 basis points of the year over year margin expansion during 2016 compared to 2015. Although an increase in higher margin consulting services sales generated a 15 basis point improvement in gross margin year over year, the increase was partially offset by a decline in margin generated by sales of warranty services of 12 basis points year to year.\nEMEA's gross profit remained flat in 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, gross profit was up 7% in 2016 compared to 2015. As a percentage of net sales, gross margin increased by approximately 30 basis points year over year. The year over year increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to a net increase in product margin, which includes partner funding and freight, of 19 basis points during 2016 compared to 2015. The product margin expansion was due primarily to the positive effect on software margin that results from the higher volume of sales that are recorded on a net sales recognition basis within the net sales line item. Changes in the mix and size of transactions and an increase in partner funding earlier in 2016 also contributed to the margin improvement during 2016 compared to 2015. In addition, we recognized a 13 basis point increase in margin resulting from higher fees from enterprise software agreements during 2016 compared to 2015.\nAPAC's gross profit increased 12% in 2016 compared to 2015, with gross margin increasing to 18.2% in 2016 from 16.0% in 2015. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, gross profit increased 14% in 2016 compared to 2015. The improvement in gross margin in 2016 compared to 2015 was due primarily to the positive effect on margin that results from the higher volume of sales that are recorded on a net sales recognition basis, an increase in the mix of higher margin services net sales, higher partner funding and an increase in hardware sales during 2016 compared to 2015.\nOperating Expenses.\nSelling and Administrative Expenses. Selling and administrative expenses increased $337,000 in 2016 compared to 2015. Selling and administrative expenses decreased approximately 20 basis points as a percentage of net sales in 2016 compared to 2015. Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales by operating segment for 2016 and 2015 were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 149: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Net\nSales </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Net\nSales </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> North America\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>401,316 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>396,603 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EMEA\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>160,269 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>165,879 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> APAC\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,658 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,424 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>585,243 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>584,906 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> North America's selling and administrative expenses increased 1%, or $4.7 million, in 2016 compared to 2015, but decreased approximately 30 basis points year to year as a percentage of net sales to 10.1% of net sales in 2016. Teammate benefits expense, including healthcare expenses, increased $6.0 million year over year due to an increase in healthcare claims, and variable compensation increased $4.6 million as a result of the increase in net sales and gross profit year over year. These increases in expenses during 2016 compared to 2015 were partially offset by a decline in the provision for losses on accounts receivable of $3.4 million in 2016 compared to 2015 due to favorable collection results and a decrease in salaries and wages and contract labor of $2.7 million resulting from cost reduction initiatives implemented earlier in 2016 across our North America business. As discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report, our results for 2015 include a non-cash charge of $800,000 to reduce the carrying amount of our real estate held for sale to its estimated fair value less costs to sell.\nWith the acquisition of Datalink on January 6, 2017, we expect to record amortization expense associated with intangible assets acquired from Datalink of approximately $11.5 million in 2017 and $9.2 million in each of 2019 through 2026.\nEMEA's selling and administrative expenses decreased 3%, or $5.6 million, in 2016 compared to 2015, and decreased approximately 10 basis points to 12.0% of net sales in 2016. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, selling and administrative expenses increased 3% compared to the prior year. The increase in expenses (excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates) was primarily driven by increased salaries and wages and teammate benefits expenses attributed to higher average cost per head in conjunction with our investments in sales and services related headcount to support services and Cloud growth across the region.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nAPAC's selling and administrative expenses increased 6%, or $1.2 million, in 2016 compared to 2015, and increased approximately 90 basis points to 13.5% of net sales in 2016. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, selling and administrative expenses increased 7% compared to the prior year. The year over year increase is primarily driven by higher variable compensation as a result of the increase in gross profit year over year and increased selling and administrative expenses as a result of the acquisition of Ignia, a business technology consulting and managed services provider, effective September 1, 2016.\nSeverance and Restructuring Expenses. During 2016, North America, EMEA and APAC recorded severance expense, net of adjustments, totaling $3.0 million, $1.5 million and $118,000, respectively. The North America charges related to a headcount reduction as part of cost reduction initiatives early in 2016 noted previously, while the EMEA charges related to significant restructuring activities, primarily in the United Kingdom, Germany and France, as we worked to reduce our selling and administrative expenses in EMEA. Current period charges were offset by adjustments for changes in estimates of previous accruals as cash payments were made during 2016. During 2015, North America and EMEA recorded severance expense, net of adjustments, totaling $1.1 million and $3.8 million, respectively. APAC did not record any severance expense in 2015. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further discussion of severance and restructuring activities.\nAcquisition-related Expenses. During 2016, we incurred $169,000 in direct third-party transaction costs related to the acquisition of Ignia and $4.3 million in such costs related to the acquisition of Datalink that was completed on January 6, 2017. See Notes 22 and 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further discussion of acquisitions.\nNon-Operating (Income) Expense.\nInterest Income. Interest income for 2016 and 2015 was generated from interest earned on cash and cash equivalent bank balances. The increase in interest income year over year is primarily due to higher interest rates earned on such balances and to higher average interest-bearing cash and cash equivalent balances during 2016.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense primarily relates to borrowings under our financing facilities and imputed interest under our inventory financing facility. Interest expense increased 19% in 2016 compared to 2015 due primarily to higher borrowing rates and higher average daily balances under our debt facilities in 2016 compared to 2015, while imputed interest under our inventory financing facility remained flat from 2015 to 2016 at $3.4 million. For a description of our various financing facilities, see Notes 5 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nNet Foreign Currency Exchange Gains/Losses. These gains/losses result from foreign currency transactions, including foreign currency derivative contracts and intercompany balances that are not considered long-term in nature. The change in net foreign currency exchange gains/losses is due primarily to the underlying changes in the applicable exchange rates, partially mitigated by our use of foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the effects of fluctuations in foreign currencies on certain of our non-functional currency assets and liabilities.\nOther Expense, Net. Other expense, net, consists primarily of bank fees associated with our cash management activities.\nIncome Tax Expense. Our effective tax rate for 2016 was 39.3% compared to 36.4% in 2015. The increase in the tax rate from 2015 to 2016 was primarily due to the effect of a change in tax law that was enacted in December 2016 related to the taxation of foreign currency translation gains or losses arising from qualified business units and the effect of non-deductible acquisition-related expenses incurred in 2016. The effective tax rate in 2016 was higher than the federal statutory rate of 35.0% primarily due to the increases in the valuation allowances in certain foreign jurisdictions and state taxes in the United States as well as the tax law change during the fourth quarter of 2016 and the effect of non-deductible acquisition-related expenses incurred in 2016, as noted previously. These increases in our effective tax rate in 2016 were offset partially by lower taxes on earnings in foreign jurisdictions.

Our net sales by operating segment for 2015 and 2014 were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 150: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> North America\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,823,528 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,562,726 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EMEA\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,371,137 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,539,968 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> APAC\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>178,425 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>213,535 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,373,090 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,316,229 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Net sales in North America increased 7%, or $260.8 million, in 2015 compared to 2014. Net sales of hardware, software and services increased 7%, 5% and 20%, respectively, year over year. Net sales in the hardware category were up due to higher sales of client devices and networking and server products to large enterprise and public sector clients, including server sales resulting from the end of life of Microsoft Windows Server 2003 and the completion of a number of multi-quarter network deployments during 2015. Software sales comparisons reflect growth driven from stronger demand for business productivity and security solutions, particularly in the public sector, where we added new clients and continued to grow our existing portfolio in 2015. Services sales improved with additional consulting services engagements and technical deployments performed during 2015, reflecting the benefits of expanding our solutions capabilities, including the acquisition of BlueMetal in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nNet sales in EMEA decreased 11%, or $168.8 million, in U.S. dollars, in 2015 compared to 2014. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, net sales increased 2% in 2015 compared to 2014. Net sales of services were up 9% year over year, while net sales of hardware and software were down 7% and 14%, respectively, in 2015 compared to 2014. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, net sales of services, hardware and software increased 24%, 2% and 1%, respectively, year over year. The increase in services net sales was due primarily to increased sales of Cloud solutions and third-party services to new and existing clients across the region. The increase in hardware net sales (excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates) was due primarily to higher volume in sales with our corporate and public sector clients, with year over year growth most notably in the server hardware category. The increase in software net sales (excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates) was driven by higher volume with our public sector and service provider clients, primarily for business productivity solutions, earlier in 2015, offset by the effect of certain large software transactions in the fourth quarter of 2014 that did not recur in 2015.\nNet sales in APAC decreased 16%, or $35.1 million, in 2015 compared to 2014. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, net sales decreased 5% in 2015 compared to 2014 due to lower volume as a result of a softer economy and a higher mix of software maintenance sales, which are recorded on a net sales recognition basis.\nNet sales by category for North America, EMEA and APAC were as follows for 2015 and 2014:\nTable 151: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>North America </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>EMEA </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>APAC </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales Mix\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hardware\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Software\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>89 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Services\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nGross Profit.

The decline in gross margin was due primarily to a 21 basis point decrease in margin contributed by agency fees from enterprise software agreements due primarily to partner program changes and a 20 basis point decrease in product margin, which includes partner funding and freight. The decrease in product margin reflects a higher mix of device sales to large enterprise and public sector clients at lower margins, as well as the negative effect on the year over year comparison of a reduction in costs of goods sold in 2014 of approximately $4.1 million associated with the settlement or recovery of previously disputed sales tax amounts during 2014. These decreases in margin were partially offset by a 17 basis point increase in sales of higher margin services in 2015 compared to 2014.\nEMEA's gross profit decreased 7% in 2015 compared to 2014. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, gross profit in 2015 was up 6% compared to 2014. As a percentage of net sales, gross margin increased by approximately 60 basis points year over year. The increase in gross margin was due primarily to a 49 basis point increase in product margin, which includes partner funding and freight, and a 12 basis point increase in sales of higher margin services. The primary driver of the increase in product margin during 2015 compared to 2014 was the favorable effect of certain large, low margin software transactions in 2014 that did not recur in 2015.\nAPAC's gross profit decreased 19% in 2015 compared to 2014. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, gross profit in 2015 decreased 7% compared to 2014. As a percentage of net sales, gross margin decreased by approximately 40 basis points, due primarily to a 69 basis point decrease in margin driven by lower fees from enterprise software agreements resulting from partner program changes. This decrease in margin was partially offset by a 21 basis point increase in sales of higher margin services in 2015 compared to 2014.\nOperating Expenses.\nSelling and Administrative Expenses. Selling and administrative expenses increased 1%, or $7.9 million, in 2015 compared to 2014. Selling and administrative expenses increased approximately 10 basis points as a percentage of net sales in 2015 compared to 2014.

As discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report, our results for 2015 and 2014 include non-cash charges of $800,000 and $5.2 million, respectively, to reduce the carrying amount of our owned real estate in Bloomingdale, Illinois that was held for sale to its estimated fair value less costs to sell. Additionally, salaries and wages and contract labor increased $15.2 million year over year due to investments in sales and services personnel, variable compensation increased approximately $6.3 million year over year as a result of improved net sales and gross profit performance and teammate-related expenses increased $2.5 million year over year due primarily to an increase in healthcare benefit costs due to increased claims under self-insured programs.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nEMEA's selling and administrative expenses decreased 7%, or $12.9 million, in 2015 compared to 2014, but, as a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses increased approximately 50 basis points to 12.1% of net sales in 2015. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, selling and administrative expenses increased 5% in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase was primarily driven by higher salaries and wages from investments in sales and services related headcount to support services and Cloud growth across the region.\nAPAC's selling and administrative expenses decreased 11%, or $2.8 million, in 2015 compared to 2014, but, as a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses increased approximately 80 basis points to 12.6% of net sales in 2015. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, selling and administrative expenses increased 3% compared to the prior year. The increase from 2014 to 2015 is primarily driven by higher salaries and wages and from an increase in teammate-related expenses, partially offset by lower variable compensation based on net sales and gross profit performance in 2015 compared to 2014.\nSeverance and Restructuring Expenses. During 2015, North America and EMEA recorded severance expense, net of adjustments, totaling $1.1 million and $3.8 million, respectively, related to a continued review of resource needs in North America and additional restructuring activities in EMEA. In North America and EMEA, $1.5 million and $4.0 million, respectively, in new severance costs were offset by $418,000 and $182,000, respectively, of adjustments to prior severance accruals due to changes in estimates during 2015. During 2014, North America, EMEA and APAC recorded severance expense, net of adjustments, totaling $971,000, $3.4 million and $106,000, respectively. In North America and EMEA, $1.5 million and $3.9 million, respectively, in new severance costs were offset by $492,000 and $531,000, respectively, of adjustments to prior severance accruals due to changes in estimates during 2014. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further discussion of severance and restructuring activities.\nNon-Operating (Income) Expense.\nInterest Income. Interest income for 2015 and 2014 was generated from interest earned on cash and cash equivalent bank balances. The decrease in interest income from 2014 to 2015 is primarily due to lower average interest-bearing cash and cash equivalent balances and lower interest rates earned on such balances during 2015.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense primarily relates to borrowings under our financing facilities and imputed interest under our inventory financing facility. Interest expense increased 20% in 2015 compared to 2014 due primarily to higher average daily balances under our inventory financing facility in 2015 compared to 2014, resulting in an increase in imputed interest under the facility from $2.4 million in 2014 to $3.4 million in 2015. For a description of our various financing facilities, see Notes 5 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nNet Foreign Currency Exchange Gains/Losses. These gains/losses result from foreign currency transactions, including foreign currency derivative contracts and intercompany balances that are not considered long-term in nature. The change in net foreign currency exchange gains/losses is due primarily to the underlying changes in the applicable exchange rates, partially mitigated by our use of foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the effects of fluctuations in foreign currencies on certain of our non-functional currency assets and liabilities.\nOther Expense, Net. Other expense, net, consists primarily of bank fees associated with our cash management activities.\nIncome Tax Expense. Our effective tax rate for 2015 was 36.4% compared to 39.1% in 2014. The decrease in the tax rate from 2014 to 2015 was primarily due to reduced losses in certain foreign jurisdictions in 2015, resulting in less of an increase in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets related to these foreign operating losses. The effective tax rate in 2015 was higher than the federal statutory rate of 35.0% primarily due to state taxes in the United States as well as the increases in the valuation allowances in certain foreign jurisdictions. These increases in our effective tax rate in 2015 were offset partially by lower taxes on earnings in foreign jurisdictions. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further discussion of income tax expense.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table sets forth certain consolidated cash flow information for 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):\nTable 154: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>95,805 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>180,510 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>110,319 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21,185 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(57,637 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,511 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(57,907 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(82,736 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(48,530 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Foreign currency exchange effect on cash and cash equivalent balances\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,809 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16,683 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16,571 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,904 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,454 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,707 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>187,978 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>164,524 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>126,817 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents at end of year\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>202,882 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>187,978 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>164,524 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Cash and Cash Flow\nOur primary uses of cash during 2016 were to fund working capital requirements, repurchase shares of our common stock, pay down our debt balances, fund capital expenditures and acquire Ignia. Operating activities provided $95.8 million in cash in 2016. Both the 2016 and 2015 results are affected by individually significant transactions at each year end, whereby a single significant receivable was collected from a client in the fourth quarter of the year for which the related payment to the supplier was due and paid in January of the following year, as discussed in more detail below. During 2016, we repurchased $50.0 million of our common stock, made net combined repayments on our long-term debt facilities of $49.5 million and acquired Ignia for $10.8 million, net of cash acquired. Capital expenditures were $12.3 million in 2016, a 9% decrease from 2015, reflecting lower IT investments year to year. Cash and cash equivalent balances in 2016 and 2015 were negatively affected by $1.8 million and $16.7 million, respectively, as a result of foreign currency exchange rates.\nWe anticipate that cash flows from operations, together with the funds available under our financing facilities, will be adequate to support our presently anticipated cash and working capital requirements for operations as well as other strategic investments over the next 12 months. We currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate any foreign undistributed earnings. We expect existing domestic cash and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating cash activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as capital expenditures and debt repayments, for at least the next 12 months.\nNet cash provided by operating activities. Cash flows from operating activities reflect our net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items such as depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense and write-offs and write-downs of assets, as well as changes in asset and liability balances. In 2016, the increases in accounts receivable and accounts payable reflect increased sales and associated costs of goods sold, respectively, in 2016 compared to 2015. However, the 2016 results are also affected by a single significant receivable collected from a client in the fourth quarter of 2016 for which the related payment to the supplier of approximately $160 million was due and paid in January 2017, as noted previously. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we had a similar experience with a significant receivable collected in the quarter for which the payment to the supplier of approximately $60 million was not made until the first quarter of 2016. Excluding the effects of these two individually significant timing differences, cash flow from operations would have been nominal for 2016. Additionally, the increase in accounts payable reflected as cash provided by operating activities in 2016 is affected by the increased use of our inventory financing facility in 2016 to facilitate the purchase of inventory from various suppliers. Increases in accounts payable under this facility are reflected as cash provided by financing activities, as discussed below. Had these purchases been made without using the inventory financing facility during 2016, the net borrowings under our inventory financing facility of $48.6 million that are reflected as cash flows from financing activities would have been reflected as an increase in accounts payable, which would be an increase in cash provided by operating activities. We used more working capital in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, as our sales growth was weighted to the last two months of the current year. The $50.1 million increase in other assets was primarily a result of our deferral of costs for certain payments made or payable to partners at December 31, 2016, in advance of our being able to recognize the related revenue. The $28.9 million increase in inventories was primarily attributable to an increase in inventory levels at December 31, 2016, to support specific client engagements and hardware sale transactions in transit to clients as of December 31, 2016 such that delivery was not deemed to have occurred until the product was received by the client in early January 2017.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nIn 2015, the increases in accounts receivable and accounts payable reflect increased sales and associated costs of goods sold, respectively, in 2015 compared to 2014. However, the 2015 results are also affected by the single significant receivable collected from a client in the fourth quarter of 2015 for which the related payment to the supplier of approximately $60 million was due and paid in January 2016, as noted previously. The increase in other assets was primarily a result of our deferral of costs for certain payments made or payable to partners at December 31, 2015, in advance of our being able to recognize the related revenue. As a result, cash flows from operating activities in 2015 exceeded our historical average annual cash flow generation of $80 million to $120 million.\nIn 2014, the increases in accounts receivable and accounts payable reflect increased sales and associated costs of goods sold, respectively, in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase in inventories is primarily attributable to an increase in inventory levels at December 31, 2014, to support specific client engagements and hardware sale transactions in transit to clients as of December 31, 2014 such that delivery was not deemed to have occurred until the product was received by the client in early January 2015. The decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities in 2014 was primarily due to the relative timing of sales tax and VAT payments in 2014 compared to 2013.\nOur consolidated cash flow operating metrics for the quarters ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 are as follows:\nTable 155: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Days sales outstanding in ending accounts receivable (\u201cDSOs\u201d) (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>87 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>83 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Days inventory outstanding (\u201cDIOs\u201d) (b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Days purchases outstanding in ending accounts payable (\u201cDPOs\u201d) (c)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(88 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(77 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(68 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash conversion cycle (days) (d)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Calculated as the balance of accounts receivable, net at the end of the period divided by daily net sales. Daily net sales is calculated as net sales for the quarter divided by 92 days. \n (b) Calculated as average inventories (excluding inventories not available for sale) divided by daily costs of goods sold. Average inventories is calculated as the sum of the balances of inventories at the beginning of the period plus inventories at the end of the period divided by two. Daily costs of goods sold is calculated as costs of goods sold for the quarter divided by 92 days. \n (c) Calculated as the sum of the balances of accounts payable - trade and accounts payable - inventory financing facility at the end of the period divided by daily costs of goods sold. Daily costs of goods sold is calculated as costs of goods sold for the quarter divided by 92 days. \n (d) Calculated as DSOs plus DIOs, less DPOs.  Our cash conversion cycle was 14 days in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of six days from the fourth quarter of 2015, due primarily to an 11 day increase in DPOs driven by a single significant payment to a supplier in North America that was due and paid in January 2017. Although the payment to the supplier was not due until after year-end, we collected on the accounts receivable from the client in the fourth quarter of 2016 under normal credit terms. Both the 2016 and 2015 results are affected by individually significant transactions at each year end; however, the magnitude of the 2016 transaction had a greater effect on DPOs. The computation of DPOs for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 includes a payable to a supplier of $160 million, and the computation of DPOs for the quarter ended December 30, 2015 includes a payable to a supplier of $60 million, both of which do not have corresponding accounts receivable outstanding as of the respective period ends.\nOur cash conversion cycle was 20 days in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of four days from the fourth quarter of 2014, due primarily to an increase in DPOs in North America driven by a single significant payment to a supplier that was due and paid in January 2016, after the resolution of certain invoicing issues with the supplier. Although we did not pay the supplier until after year-end, we collected on the accounts receivable from the client in the fourth quarter of 2015 under normal credit terms.\nOur cash conversion cycle was 24 days in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2014, an improvement of three days from the fourth quarter of 2013, due primarily to higher DPOs in North America driven by the timing of payments to suppliers during the quarter ended December 31, 2014 offset by a one day increase in DIOs due to the increase in inventories discussed above.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nWe expect that cash flow from operations will be used, at least partially, to fund working capital as we typically pay our partners on average terms that are shorter than the average terms we grant to our clients in order to take advantage of supplier discounts. We intend to use cash generated in 2017 in excess of working capital needs to support our capital expenditures for the year and to pay down our debt balances. We also may use cash to fund potential acquisitions to add select capabilities.\nNet cash used in investing activities. Capital expenditures of $12.3 million, $13.4 million and $10.0 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, were primarily related to technology and facility enhancements. We expect total capital expenditures in 2017 to be between $15.0 million and $20.0 million, primarily for technology-related upgrade projects and integration of acquisitions.\nDuring 2016, we acquired Ignia for $10.8 million, net of cash acquired, and during 2015, we acquired BlueMetal for $44.2 million, net of cash acquired.\nNet cash used in financing activities. During 2016, we made net combined repayments on our long-term debt under our revolving facility and our accounts receivable securitization facility (\u201cABS facility\u201d) of $49.5 million and had net borrowings under our inventory financing facility of $48.6 million. In 2016, we also funded $50.0 million of repurchases of our common stock. During 2015, we had net combined borrowings on our long-term debt under our revolving facility and our ABS facility of $28.0 million and made net repayments under our inventory financing facility of $16.5 million. In 2015, we also funded $91.8 million of repurchases of our common stock. During 2014, we had net combined repayments on our long-term debt under our revolving facility and our ABS facility of $5.5 million and had net borrowings under our inventory financing facility of $7.5 million. In 2014, we also funded $50.4 million of repurchases of our common stock.\nFinancing Facilities\nOn June 23, 2016, we entered into amendments to our revolving facility, our ABS facility and our inventory financing facility.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our long-term debt balance consisted of $39.5 million outstanding under our $250.0 million ABS facility and no amounts outstanding under our $350.0 million revolving facility. As of December 31, 2016, the current portion of our long-term debt relates solely to our capital lease obligations. Our objective is to pay our debt balances down while retaining adequate cash balances to meet overall business objectives.\nOn January 6, 2017, we funded the acquisition of Datalink through a combination of cash on hand and approximately $196.0 million in borrowings under our revolving facility. In conjunction with the acquisition, we amended our revolving facility to expand the facility by $175.0 million in the form of a Term Loan A that requires amortization payments in years one through five. We anticipate that these additional borrowings will increase our 2017 interest expense by approximately $6 million compared to interest expense incurred in 2016 and will require additional cash to fund interest and amortization payments over the term of the loan. See Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a description of our amendment to our revolving facility in conjunction with our acquisition of Datalink.\nWhile the ABS facility has a stated maximum amount, the actual availability under the ABS facility is limited by the quantity and quality of the underlying accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2016, qualified receivables were sufficient to permit access to the full $250.0 million under the ABS facility.\nOur consolidated debt balance that can be outstanding at the end of any fiscal quarter under our revolving facility and our ABS facility is limited by certain financial covenants, particularly a maximum leverage ratio. The maximum leverage ratio is calculated as aggregate debt outstanding divided by the sum of the Company's trailing twelve month net earnings (loss) plus (i) interest expense, excluding non-cash imputed interest on our inventory financing facility, (ii) income tax expense (benefit), (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) non-cash stock-based compensation, (v) extraordinary or non-recurring non-cash losses or expenses and (vi) certain cash restructuring and acquisition-related charges, not to exceed specified caps (\u201cadjusted earnings\u201d). The maximum leverage ratio permitted under the facilities was increased from 2.75 times to 3.00 times trailing twelve-month adjusted earnings in conjunction with the amendments to the facilities in June 2016 and may increase to 3.50 times trailing twelve-month adjusted earnings in certain circumstances. The maximum ratio was increased in conjunction with the acquisition of Datalink in January 2017. See Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. We anticipate that we will be in compliance with our maximum leverage ratio requirements over the next four quarters. However, a significant drop in the Company's adjusted earnings would limit the amount of indebtedness that could be outstanding at the end of any fiscal quarter to a level that would be below the Company's consolidated maximum facility amounts. Based on the maximum permitted leverage ratio as of December 31, 2016, the Company's debt balance that could have been outstanding under our revolving facility and our ABS facility was the full amount of the maximum borrowing capacity of $600.0 million.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nOur revolving facility and our ABS facility contain various covenants customary for transactions of this type, including limitations on the payment of dividends and the requirement that we comply with maximum leverage and minimum fixed charge ratio requirements, comply with a minimum receivable requirement and meet monthly, quarterly and annual reporting requirements. If we fail to comply with these covenants, the lenders would be able to demand payment within a specified time period. At December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all such covenants. Further, the terms of the ABS facility identify various circumstances that would result in an \u201camortization event\u201d under the facility. At December 31, 2016, no such \u201camortization event\u201d had occurred.\nWe also have an agreement with a financial intermediary to facilitate the purchase of inventory from various suppliers under certain terms and conditions. These amounts are classified separately as accounts payable - inventory financing facility in our consolidated balance sheets.\nThe aggregate availability for vendor purchases under our inventory financing facility is $325,000,000. From time to time and at our option, we may request to increase the aggregate amount available under the inventory financing facility by up to an aggregate of $25,000,000, subject to customary conditions. The facility matures on June 23, 2021. Additionally, the facility may be renewed under certain circumstances described in the agreement for successive 12-month periods. Interest does not accrue on accounts payable under this facility provided the accounts payable are paid within stated vendor terms (ranging from 30 to 60 days).\nNotes 5 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report also include: a description of our financing facilities; amounts outstanding; amounts available and weighted average borrowings and interest rates during the year.\nUndistributed Foreign Earnings\nCash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation upon repatriation to the United States. We do not provide for U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of those of our foreign subsidiaries where earnings are reinvested and, in the opinion of management, will continue to be reinvested indefinitely outside of the United States. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $179.9 million in cash and cash equivalents in certain of our foreign subsidiaries where we consider undistributed earnings of these foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested. As of December 31, 2016, the majority of our foreign cash resides in the Netherlands, Canada, Australia, Russia and the United Kingdom. Certain of these cash balances will be remitted to the United States by paying down intercompany payables generated in the ordinary course of business. This repayment would not change our policy to indefinitely reinvest earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are deemed to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States were approximately $105.3 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $88.9 million at the end of 2015. We intend to use undistributed earnings for general business purposes in the foreign jurisdictions as well as to fund our capital expenditures and potential acquisitions.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have entered into off-balance sheet arrangements, which include guaranties and indemnifications. These arrangements are discussed in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. We believe that none of our off-balance sheet arrangements have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition, sales or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nContractual Obligations\nAt December 31, 2016, our contractual obligations for continuing operations were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 160: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments due by period </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than\n1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3\nYears </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5\nYears </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More than\n5 Years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital lease obligations, including interest payments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,324 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>542 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>782 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Inventory financing facility (b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>154,930 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>154,930 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations (c)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66,555 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,571 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,810 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,666 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,508 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Severance and restructuring obligations (d)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,164 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,164 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other contractual obligations (e)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,038 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,959 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,936 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,128 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>273,511 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>174,166 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>68,028 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,681 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,636 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Reflects the $39.5 million outstanding at December 31, 2016 under our ABS facility as due in June 2019, the date at which the facility matures. See further discussion in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. \n (b) As of December 31, 2016, this amount has been included in our contractual obligations table above as being due in less than 1 year due to the 30- to 60-day stated vendor terms. See further discussion in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. \n (c) Amounts in the table above exclude non-cancellable rental income of approximately $1.5 million due in less than one year and a total of approximately $3.2 million due in years one through three. \n (d) As a result of approved severance and restructuring plans, we expect future cash expenditures related to employee termination benefits. See further discussion in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. \n (e) The table above includes: \n I. Estimated interest payments of $751,000 in 2017 and 2018 and $375,000 in the first six months of 2019, based on the current debt balance at December 31, 2016 of $39.5 million under our ABS facility, multiplied by the weighted average interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 of 1.9% per annum. \n II. Amounts totaling $388,000 through 2018 for other contractual obligations. \n III. We estimate that we will owe $6.8 million in future years in connection with the obligations to perform asset-retirement activities that are conditional on a future event. \nThe table above excludes $2.2 million of unrecognized tax benefits, including $195,000 related to accrued interest, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See further discussion in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nAlthough we set purchase targets with our partners tied to the amount of supplier reimbursements we receive, we have no material contractual purchase obligations with our partners.\nAcquisitions\nOur strategy includes the possible acquisition of or investments in other businesses to expand or complement our operations or to add select services capabilities. The magnitude, timing and nature of any future acquisitions or investments will depend on a number of factors, including the availability of suitable candidates, the negotiation of acceptable terms, our financial capabilities and general economic and business conditions. Financing for future transactions would result in the utilization of cash, incurrence of additional debt, issuance of stock or some combination of the three. See Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a discussion of our acquisition of Datalink on January 6, 2017 and the amendment to our revolving facility to fund, in part, the acquisition.\nInflation\nWe have historically not been adversely affected by inflation, as technological advances and competition within the IT industry have generally caused the prices of the products we sell to decline and product life cycles tend to be short. This requires our growth in unit sales to exceed the decline in prices in order to increase our net sales. We believe that most price increases could be passed on to our clients, as prices charged by us are not set by long-term contracts; however, as a result of competitive pressure, there can be no assurance that the full effect of any such price increases could be passed on to our clients.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nThe information contained in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report concerning a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including our expected dates of adoption and the estimated effects on our results of operations and financial condition, is incorporated by reference herein.\n ", "item_7_text": "Item 7 of this report.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of this report. Our actual results could differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A and elsewhere in this report.\nOverview\nWe are a Fortune 500-ranked global provider of IT hardware, software, Cloud and service solutions to business, government, healthcare and educational clients in North America; Europe, the Middle East, Africa (\u201cEMEA\u201d); and Asia-Pacific (\u201cAPAC\u201d). Our offerings in North America and select countries in EMEA and APAC include hardware, software and services. Our offerings in the remainder of our EMEA and APAC segments are largely software and select software-related services.\nFull year 2016 financial and operational highlights included the following:\n \u2022 In North America: \n \u2022 We successfully completed the integration of BlueMetal into the business, which helped drive double-digit growth in services sales for the full year; \n \u2022 We gained hardware market share from competitors according to third party data; and \n \u2022 We continued to help clients assess and migrate to the Cloud, either through hybrid Cloud/data center solutions or public Cloud alternatives. \n \u2022 In EMEA: \n \u2022 We executed well in the core business, growing earnings from operations by 44% year over year, while continuing to transform to a Cloud and solutions company; and \n \u2022 We believe that we led the market in Cloud adoption with our largest software partner in EMEA. \n \u2022 In APAC: \n \u2022 We continued to diversify our business mix by increasing our hardware and services sales across the region; and \n \u2022 We acquired Ignia in the third quarter as part of our continuing efforts to deliver value-added services globally to our clients. \nOn a consolidated basis, for the year ended December 31, 2016, our net sales of $5.5 billion increased 2% compared to 2015, up 4% year over year excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. Our resulting gross profit also increased by 4%, or $26.8 million, compared to 2015, up 6% year over year excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. Consolidated gross margin improved approximately 20 basis points to 13.5% of net sales in 2016. Selling and administrative expenses remained flat, increasing $337,000 in 2016 compared to 2015. We reported earnings from operations of $148.8 million in 2016, an increase of 18% compared to the prior year, which represented 2.7% of net sales, compared to 2.4% in the prior year. Our effective tax rate in 2016 was 39.3% compared to 36.4% in 2015 and 39.1% in 2014. Net earnings and diluted net earnings per share were $84.7 million and $2.32, respectively, in 2016. In 2015, we reported net earnings of $75.9 million and diluted net earnings per share of $1.98. In 2014, we reported net earnings of $75.7 million and diluted net earnings per share of $1.83.\nThe results of operations for 2016 include the following items:\n \u2022 the acquisition of Ignia effective September 1, 2016; \n \u2022 transaction costs totaling $4.4 million, $4.2 million net of tax, associated with the acquisitions of Ignia and Datalink; \n \u2022 severance and restructuring expenses of $4.6 million, $3.3 million net of tax; \n \u2022 a gain of $338,000 on the sale of our Bloomingdale, Illinois real estate; and \n \u2022 the repurchase of approximately 1.9 million shares of the Company's common stock for $50 million. \nThe results of operations for 2016 do not include the results of Datalink, as the acquisition did not close until January 6, 2017.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nThe results of operations for 2015 include the following items:\n \u2022 the acquisition of BlueMetal effective October 1, 2015; \n \u2022 severance and restructuring expenses of $4.9 million, $4.3 million net of tax; \n \u2022 an impairment loss of $800,000 to further reduce the carrying amount of our previously owned real estate in Bloomingdale, Illinois to its estimated fair value less costs to sell; and \n \u2022 the repurchase of approximately 3.3 million shares of the Company's common stock for $91.8 million. \nThe results of operations for 2014 include the following items:\n \u2022 severance and restructuring expenses of $4.4 million, $3.7 million net of tax; \n \u2022 an impairment loss of $4.6 million and accelerated depreciation of $620,000 to reduce the carrying amount of our previously owned real estate in Bloomingdale, Illinois to its estimated fair value less costs to sell; \n \u2022 a reduction in costs of goods sold of approximately $4.1 million associated with the settlement or recovery of previously disputed sales tax amounts; \n \u2022 a reduction in selling and administrative expenses to recognize a $895,000 gain upon our sale of certain real estate to a related party; and \n \u2022 the repurchase of approximately 2.1 million shares of the Company's common stock for $50.4 million. \nThroughout the \u201cOverview\u201d and \u201cResults of Operations\u201d sections of \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d we refer to changes in net sales, gross profit, selling and administrative expenses and earnings from operations on a consolidated basis and in North America, EMEA and APAC excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. In computing these amounts and percentages, we compare the current period amount as translated into U.S. dollars under the applicable accounting standards to the prior period amount in local currency translated into U.S. dollars utilizing the weighted average translation rate for the current period.\nNet of tax amounts referenced above were computed using the statutory tax rate for the taxing jurisdictions in the operating segment in which the related expenses were recorded, adjusted for the effects of valuation allowances on net operating losses in certain jurisdictions.\nDuring 2016, we generated $95.8 million of cash flows from operations, we repurchased $50 million of our common stock and utilized approximately $10.8 million, net of cash acquired, to fund the acquisition of Ignia. We ended the year with $202.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and $39.5 million of debt outstanding under our long-term debt facilities.\nDuring 2016, we amended our revolving facility and our ABS facility and increased the combined maximum borrowing capacity available to us by $50 million and extended the maturity dates of the agreement to 2021 and 2019, respectively. In addition, we amended our inventory financing facility and increased the maximum capacity available to us under that facility by $75 million and extended the maturity date to 2021.\nDetails about segment results of operations can be found in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nOur discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist in the understanding of our consolidated financial statements, including the changes in certain key items in those consolidated financial statements from year to year and the primary factors that contributed to those changes, as well as how certain critical accounting estimates affect our consolidated financial statements.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nGeneral\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). For a summary of significant accounting policies, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results, however, may differ from our estimates. Members of our senior management have discussed the critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.\nWe consider the following to be our critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:\nSales Recognition\nSales are recognized when title and risk of loss are passed to the client, there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement for sale, delivery has occurred and/or services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Our standard sales terms are F.O.B. shipping point or equivalent, at which time title and risk of loss have passed to the client. However, because we either (i) have a general practice of covering client losses while products are in transit despite title and risk of loss contractually transferring at the point of shipment or (ii) have specifically stated F.O.B. destination contractual terms with the client, delivery is not deemed to have occurred until the point in time when the product is received by the client.\nWe leverage drop-shipment arrangements with many of our partners and suppliers to deliver products to our clients without having to physically hold the inventory at our warehouses, thereby increasing efficiency and reducing costs. We recognize revenue for drop-shipment arrangements on a gross basis when the product is received by the client. We recognize revenue on a gross basis as the principal in the transaction because we control the transaction as the primary obligor for product fulfillment in the arrangement, we assume inventory risk if the product is returned by the client, we set the price of the product charged to the client, we assume credit risk for the amounts invoiced, and we work closely with our clients to determine their hardware and software specifications.\nWe make provisions for estimated product returns that we expect to occur under our return policy based upon historical return rates. Our manufacturers warrant most of the products we market, and it is our policy to request that clients return their defective products directly to the manufacturer for warranty service during the manufacturer's warranty period. On selected products, and for selected client service reasons, we may accept returns directly from the client and then either credit the client or ship a replacement product. We generally offer a limited 15- to 30-day return policy for unopened products and certain opened products, which are consistent with manufacturers' terms; however, for some products we may charge restocking fees. Products returned opened are processed and returned to the manufacturer or partner for repair, replacement or credit to us. Subject to some manufacturers' restrictions, certain products cannot be returned to the manufacturer for warranty processing. We resell most unopened products returned to us. If we accept a return from a client that we cannot return to the partner, we try to mitigate our losses by selling to inventory liquidators, to end users as \u201cpreviously sold\u201d or \u201cused\u201d products, or through other channels.\nRevenue is recognized from software sales when clients acquire the right to use or copy software under license, but in no case prior to the commencement of the term of the initial software license agreement, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met (i.e., evidence of the arrangement exists, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility of the fee is probable).\nWe sell certain third-party service contracts and software maintenance and Cloud or software-as-a-service subscription products for which we are not the primary obligor. These sales do not meet the criteria for gross sales recognition and, thus, are recorded on a net sales recognition basis. As we enter into contracts with third-party service providers or vendors and our clients, we evaluate whether the subsequent sales of such services should be recorded as gross sales or net sales. We determine whether we act as a principal in the transaction and assume the risks and rewards of ownership or if we are simply acting as an agent or broker. Under gross sales recognition, the selling price is recorded in sales and our cost to the third-party service provider or vendor is recorded in costs of goods sold. Under net sales recognition, the cost to the third-party service provider or vendor is recorded as a reduction to sales, resulting in net sales equal to the gross profit on the transaction, and there are no costs of goods sold.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nWe recognize revenue for sales of services ratably over the time period over which the service will be provided if there is no discernible pattern of recognition of the cost to perform the service. Billings for such services that are made in advance of the related revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the billing coverage period. Revenue from certain arrangements that allow for the use of a product or service over a period of time without taking possession of software are also accounted for ratably over the time period over which the service will be provided.\nWe recognize revenue for professional services engagements that are on a time and materials basis based upon hours incurred as the services are performed and amounts are earned. Net sales for these service engagements are not a significant portion of our consolidated net sales.\nAdditionally, we sell certain professional services contracts on a fixed fee basis. Revenues for fixed fee professional services contracts are recognized based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs. Net sales for these service contracts are not a significant portion of our consolidated net sales.\nIn certain arrangements, we may provide a combination of hardware and software products and the provision of services. Services that are performed by us in conjunction with hardware and software sales that are completed in our facilities prior to shipment of the product are recognized upon delivery, when title passes to the client, for the hardware sale. Net sales of services that are performed at client locations are primarily service-only contracts and are recorded as sales when the services are performed. The total consideration for an arrangement with multiple deliverables is allocated to all deliverables that represent a separate unit of accounting using the relative selling price method.\nPartner Funding\nWe receive payments and credits from partners, including consideration pursuant to volume sales incentive programs, volume purchase incentive programs and shared marketing expense programs. Partner funding received pursuant to volume sales incentive programs is recognized as it is earned as a reduction to costs of goods sold. Partner funding received pursuant to volume purchase incentive programs is allocated as a reduction to inventories based on the applicable incentives earned from each partner and is recorded in costs of goods sold as the related inventory is sold. Partner funding received pursuant to shared marketing expense programs is recorded as it is earned as a reduction of the related selling and administrative expenses in the period the program takes place if the consideration represents a reimbursement of specific, incremental, identifiable costs. Consideration that exceeds the specific, incremental, identifiable costs is classified as a reduction of costs of goods sold. Changes in estimates of anticipated achievement levels under individual partner programs could have a material effect on our results of operations and our cash flows.\nSee Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further discussion of our accounting policies related to partner funding.\nValuation of Long-Lived Assets Including Purchased Intangible Assets and Goodwill\nWe review property, plant and equipment and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. If such events or changes in circumstances indicate a possible impairment, our asset impairment review assesses the recoverability of the assets based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or the asset group plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset or the asset group (if any) and compares that value to the carrying value. Such impairment test is based on the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between fair value and the carrying amount. This approach uses our estimates of future market growth, forecasted net sales and costs, expected periods the assets will be utilized and appropriate discount rates.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nWe perform an annual review of our goodwill in the fourth quarter of every year and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. We continually assess whether any indicators of impairment exist, and that assessment requires a significant amount of judgment. Events or circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, unanticipated competition, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business, significant negative industry or economic trends, significant declines in our stock price for a sustained period or significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future cash flows or results of operations. Any adverse change in these factors, among others, could have a significant effect on the recoverability of goodwill and could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nThe goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a \u201ccomponent\u201d). A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and management of the segment regularly reviews the operating results of that component. When two or more components of an operating segment have similar economic characteristics, the components may be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit. An operating segment shall be deemed to be a reporting unit if all of its components are similar, if none of its components is a reporting unit, or if the segment comprises only a single component. Insight has three reporting units, which are equivalent to our operating segments.\nWe may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If it is concluded that this is the case, it is necessary to perform a quantitative two-step goodwill impairment test. Otherwise, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. In completing a quantitative test for a potential impairment of goodwill, we first compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its book value, including goodwill. Management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of our reporting units. Multiple valuation techniques can be used to assess the fair value of the reporting unit, including the market and income approaches. All of these techniques include the use of estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value or goodwill impairment, or both. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to, an appropriate control premium in excess of the market capitalization of the Company, future market growth, forecasted sales and costs and appropriate discount rates. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates. Management evaluates the merits of each significant assumption, both individually and in the aggregate, used to determine the fair value of the reporting units. If the estimated fair value exceeds book value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary. To ensure the reasonableness of the estimated fair values of our reporting units, we perform a reconciliation of our total market capitalization to the estimated fair value of all of our reporting units.\nIf the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its book value, then we are required to perform the second step of the impairment analysis by comparing the carrying amount of the goodwill with its implied fair value. In step two of the analysis, we utilize the fair value of the reporting unit computed in the first step to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. The difference between the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in step one and the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit is the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. Management must also apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of these individual assets and liabilities and may include independent valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets, such as trademarks. Management also evaluates the merits of each significant assumption, both individually and in the aggregate, used to determine the fair values of these individual assets and liabilities. If the carrying amount of our goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess.\nSee further information on the carrying value of goodwill in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate includes the effect of undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States. If there are material changes in our estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements and it becomes apparent that some or all of the undistributed earnings of a subsidiary will need to be remitted in the foreseeable future, but U.S. income taxes have not been recognized by Insight, we would be required to reassess current and future income tax expense attributable to that subsidiary. A determination that we will no longer assert indefinite reinvestment in one or more foreign jurisdictions could affect our assertion on our other foreign entities.\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We consider past operating results, future market growth, forecasted earnings, historical and projected taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and statutory tax law changes in determining the need for a valuation allowance. If we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that all or part of the net deferred tax assets would be realized, then all or part of the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed.\nWe establish liabilities for potentially unfavorable outcomes associated with uncertain tax positions taken on specific tax matters. These liabilities are based on management's assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. There may be differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these matters that may result in subsequent recognition or derecognition of a tax position based on all the available information at the time. If material adjustments are warranted, it could affect our effective tax rate.\nAdditional information about the valuation allowance and uncertain tax positions can be found in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nContingencies\nFrom time to time, we are subject to potential claims and assessments from third parties. We are also subject to various government agency, client and partner audits. We continually assess whether or not such claims have merit and warrant accrual. An accrual is made if it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Such estimates are subject to change and may affect our results of operations and our cash flows. Additional information about contingencies can be found in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table sets forth certain financial data as a percentage of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\n\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\n2016 Compared to 2015\nNet Sales. Net sales increased 2%, or $112.4 million, in 2016 compared to 2015. Our net sales by operating segment for 2016 and 2015 were as follows (dollars in thousands):\n Net sales in North America increased 4%, or $148.3 million, in 2016 compared to 2015. Net sales of hardware and services increased 5% and 10%, respectively, year over year, while net sales of software remained flat year over year. The improvement in net sales in the hardware category was due primarily to higher sales of client devices, servers and storage products. The increase in services net sales reflects the BlueMetal acquisition in October 2015 as well as organic growth in technical services projects. Software net sales during 2016 reflected the continued trend toward higher sales of Cloud-based offerings and a higher mix of software maintenance sales that are recorded on a net sales recognition basis, with net sales equal to the gross profit on the transaction.\nNet sales in EMEA decreased 2%, or $32.6 million, in 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, net sales increased 4% in 2016 compared to 2015. Net sales of services and software were up 15% and 1%, respectively, year over year, while net sales of hardware were down 9% year to year. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, net sales of services, software and hardware increased 22%, 6% and 1%, respectively, year over year. The increase in services net sales was due primarily to increased sales of license consulting services and partner delivered third-party services to new and existing clients across the region. The increase in software net sales in 2016 compared to 2015 was driven by increased volume with large enterprise clients, partially offset by a higher volume of sales of software maintenance and Cloud subscription products that are recorded on a net sales recognition basis.\nNet sales in APAC decreased 2%, or $3.3 million, in 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, net sales in 2016 remained flat compared to 2015. An increase in services and hardware net sales year over year was offset by a decrease in software net sales during 2016 compared to 2015 resulting from a higher volume of sales of software maintenance and Cloud subscription products that are recorded on a net sales recognition basis.\nNet sales by category for North America, EMEA and APAC were as follows for 2016 and 2015:\n Gross Profit. Gross profit increased 4%, or $26.8 million, in 2016 compared to 2015, with gross margin increasing approximately 20 basis points to 13.5% of net sales. Our gross profit and gross profit as a percent of net sales by operating segment for 2016 and 2015 were as follows (dollars in thousands):\n\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nNorth America's gross profit in 2016 increased 5% compared to 2015, and as a percentage of net sales, gross margin increased by approximately 10 basis points year over year. The year over year increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to increases in supplier discounts year over year as we took advantage of early pay discounts offered by certain of our partners, which generated a 6 basis point improvement in margin year over year. During 2016, we also recognized a $2.2 million insurance settlement as a reduction of cost of sales due to the nature of the related insured loss previously recorded. The insurance settlement accounted for 6 basis points of the year over year margin expansion during 2016 compared to 2015. Although an increase in higher margin consulting services sales generated a 15 basis point improvement in gross margin year over year, the increase was partially offset by a decline in margin generated by sales of warranty services of 12 basis points year to year.\nEMEA's gross profit remained flat in 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, gross profit was up 7% in 2016 compared to 2015. As a percentage of net sales, gross margin increased by approximately 30 basis points year over year. The year over year increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to a net increase in product margin, which includes partner funding and freight, of 19 basis points during 2016 compared to 2015. The product margin expansion was due primarily to the positive effect on software margin that results from the higher volume of sales that are recorded on a net sales recognition basis within the net sales line item. Changes in the mix and size of transactions and an increase in partner funding earlier in 2016 also contributed to the margin improvement during 2016 compared to 2015. In addition, we recognized a 13 basis point increase in margin resulting from higher fees from enterprise software agreements during 2016 compared to 2015.\nAPAC's gross profit increased 12% in 2016 compared to 2015, with gross margin increasing to 18.2% in 2016 from 16.0% in 2015. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, gross profit increased 14% in 2016 compared to 2015. The improvement in gross margin in 2016 compared to 2015 was due primarily to the positive effect on margin that results from the higher volume of sales that are recorded on a net sales recognition basis, an increase in the mix of higher margin services net sales, higher partner funding and an increase in hardware sales during 2016 compared to 2015.\nOperating Expenses.\nSelling and Administrative Expenses. Selling and administrative expenses increased $337,000 in 2016 compared to 2015. Selling and administrative expenses decreased approximately 20 basis points as a percentage of net sales in 2016 compared to 2015. Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales by operating segment for 2016 and 2015 were as follows (dollars in thousands):\n North America's selling and administrative expenses increased 1%, or $4.7 million, in 2016 compared to 2015, but decreased approximately 30 basis points year to year as a percentage of net sales to 10.1% of net sales in 2016. Teammate benefits expense, including healthcare expenses, increased $6.0 million year over year due to an increase in healthcare claims, and variable compensation increased $4.6 million as a result of the increase in net sales and gross profit year over year. These increases in expenses during 2016 compared to 2015 were partially offset by a decline in the provision for losses on accounts receivable of $3.4 million in 2016 compared to 2015 due to favorable collection results and a decrease in salaries and wages and contract labor of $2.7 million resulting from cost reduction initiatives implemented earlier in 2016 across our North America business. As discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report, our results for 2015 include a non-cash charge of $800,000 to reduce the carrying amount of our real estate held for sale to its estimated fair value less costs to sell.\nWith the acquisition of Datalink on January 6, 2017, we expect to record amortization expense associated with intangible assets acquired from Datalink of approximately $11.5 million in 2017 and $9.2 million in each of 2019 through 2026.\nEMEA's selling and administrative expenses decreased 3%, or $5.6 million, in 2016 compared to 2015, and decreased approximately 10 basis points to 12.0% of net sales in 2016. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, selling and administrative expenses increased 3% compared to the prior year. The increase in expenses (excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates) was primarily driven by increased salaries and wages and teammate benefits expenses attributed to higher average cost per head in conjunction with our investments in sales and services related headcount to support services and Cloud growth across the region.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nAPAC's selling and administrative expenses increased 6%, or $1.2 million, in 2016 compared to 2015, and increased approximately 90 basis points to 13.5% of net sales in 2016. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, selling and administrative expenses increased 7% compared to the prior year. The year over year increase is primarily driven by higher variable compensation as a result of the increase in gross profit year over year and increased selling and administrative expenses as a result of the acquisition of Ignia, a business technology consulting and managed services provider, effective September 1, 2016.\nSeverance and Restructuring Expenses. During 2016, North America, EMEA and APAC recorded severance expense, net of adjustments, totaling $3.0 million, $1.5 million and $118,000, respectively. The North America charges related to a headcount reduction as part of cost reduction initiatives early in 2016 noted previously, while the EMEA charges related to significant restructuring activities, primarily in the United Kingdom, Germany and France, as we worked to reduce our selling and administrative expenses in EMEA. Current period charges were offset by adjustments for changes in estimates of previous accruals as cash payments were made during 2016. During 2015, North America and EMEA recorded severance expense, net of adjustments, totaling $1.1 million and $3.8 million, respectively. APAC did not record any severance expense in 2015. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further discussion of severance and restructuring activities.\nAcquisition-related Expenses. During 2016, we incurred $169,000 in direct third-party transaction costs related to the acquisition of Ignia and $4.3 million in such costs related to the acquisition of Datalink that was completed on January 6, 2017. See Notes 22 and 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further discussion of acquisitions.\nNon-Operating (Income) Expense.\nInterest Income. Interest income for 2016 and 2015 was generated from interest earned on cash and cash equivalent bank balances. The increase in interest income year over year is primarily due to higher interest rates earned on such balances and to higher average interest-bearing cash and cash equivalent balances during 2016.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense primarily relates to borrowings under our financing facilities and imputed interest under our inventory financing facility. Interest expense increased 19% in 2016 compared to 2015 due primarily to higher borrowing rates and higher average daily balances under our debt facilities in 2016 compared to 2015, while imputed interest under our inventory financing facility remained flat from 2015 to 2016 at $3.4 million. For a description of our various financing facilities, see Notes 5 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nNet Foreign Currency Exchange Gains/Losses. These gains/losses result from foreign currency transactions, including foreign currency derivative contracts and intercompany balances that are not considered long-term in nature. The change in net foreign currency exchange gains/losses is due primarily to the underlying changes in the applicable exchange rates, partially mitigated by our use of foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the effects of fluctuations in foreign currencies on certain of our non-functional currency assets and liabilities.\nOther Expense, Net. Other expense, net, consists primarily of bank fees associated with our cash management activities.\nIncome Tax Expense. Our effective tax rate for 2016 was 39.3% compared to 36.4% in 2015. The increase in the tax rate from 2015 to 2016 was primarily due to the effect of a change in tax law that was enacted in December 2016 related to the taxation of foreign currency translation gains or losses arising from qualified business units and the effect of non-deductible acquisition-related expenses incurred in 2016. The effective tax rate in 2016 was higher than the federal statutory rate of 35.0% primarily due to the increases in the valuation allowances in certain foreign jurisdictions and state taxes in the United States as well as the tax law change during the fourth quarter of 2016 and the effect of non-deductible acquisition-related expenses incurred in 2016, as noted previously. These increases in our effective tax rate in 2016 were offset partially by lower taxes on earnings in foreign jurisdictions. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further discussion of income tax expense.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\n2015 Compared to 2014\nNet Sales. Net sales increased 1%, or $56.9 million, in 2015 compared to 2014. Our net sales by operating segment for 2015 and 2014 were as follows (dollars in thousands):\n Net sales in North America increased 7%, or $260.8 million, in 2015 compared to 2014. Net sales of hardware, software and services increased 7%, 5% and 20%, respectively, year over year. Net sales in the hardware category were up due to higher sales of client devices and networking and server products to large enterprise and public sector clients, including server sales resulting from the end of life of Microsoft Windows Server 2003 and the completion of a number of multi-quarter network deployments during 2015. Software sales comparisons reflect growth driven from stronger demand for business productivity and security solutions, particularly in the public sector, where we added new clients and continued to grow our existing portfolio in 2015. Services sales improved with additional consulting services engagements and technical deployments performed during 2015, reflecting the benefits of expanding our solutions capabilities, including the acquisition of BlueMetal in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nNet sales in EMEA decreased 11%, or $168.8 million, in U.S. dollars, in 2015 compared to 2014. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, net sales increased 2% in 2015 compared to 2014. Net sales of services were up 9% year over year, while net sales of hardware and software were down 7% and 14%, respectively, in 2015 compared to 2014. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, net sales of services, hardware and software increased 24%, 2% and 1%, respectively, year over year. The increase in services net sales was due primarily to increased sales of Cloud solutions and third-party services to new and existing clients across the region. The increase in hardware net sales (excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates) was due primarily to higher volume in sales with our corporate and public sector clients, with year over year growth most notably in the server hardware category. The increase in software net sales (excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates) was driven by higher volume with our public sector and service provider clients, primarily for business productivity solutions, earlier in 2015, offset by the effect of certain large software transactions in the fourth quarter of 2014 that did not recur in 2015.\nNet sales in APAC decreased 16%, or $35.1 million, in 2015 compared to 2014. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, net sales decreased 5% in 2015 compared to 2014 due to lower volume as a result of a softer economy and a higher mix of software maintenance sales, which are recorded on a net sales recognition basis.\nNet sales by category for North America, EMEA and APAC were as follows for 2015 and 2014:\n\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nGross Profit. Gross profit increased 1%, or $3.9 million, in 2015 compared to 2014, with gross margin decreasing approximately 10 basis points to 13.3% of net sales. Our gross profit and gross profit as a percent of net sales by operating segment for 2015 and 2014 were as follows (dollars in thousands):\n North America's gross profit in 2015 increased 5% compared to 2014, but as a percentage of net sales, gross margin decreased by approximately 30 basis points year to year. The decline in gross margin was due primarily to a 21 basis point decrease in margin contributed by agency fees from enterprise software agreements due primarily to partner program changes and a 20 basis point decrease in product margin, which includes partner funding and freight. The decrease in product margin reflects a higher mix of device sales to large enterprise and public sector clients at lower margins, as well as the negative effect on the year over year comparison of a reduction in costs of goods sold in 2014 of approximately $4.1 million associated with the settlement or recovery of previously disputed sales tax amounts during 2014. These decreases in margin were partially offset by a 17 basis point increase in sales of higher margin services in 2015 compared to 2014.\nEMEA's gross profit decreased 7% in 2015 compared to 2014. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, gross profit in 2015 was up 6% compared to 2014. As a percentage of net sales, gross margin increased by approximately 60 basis points year over year. The increase in gross margin was due primarily to a 49 basis point increase in product margin, which includes partner funding and freight, and a 12 basis point increase in sales of higher margin services. The primary driver of the increase in product margin during 2015 compared to 2014 was the favorable effect of certain large, low margin software transactions in 2014 that did not recur in 2015.\nAPAC's gross profit decreased 19% in 2015 compared to 2014. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, gross profit in 2015 decreased 7% compared to 2014. As a percentage of net sales, gross margin decreased by approximately 40 basis points, due primarily to a 69 basis point decrease in margin driven by lower fees from enterprise software agreements resulting from partner program changes. This decrease in margin was partially offset by a 21 basis point increase in sales of higher margin services in 2015 compared to 2014.\nOperating Expenses.\nSelling and Administrative Expenses. Selling and administrative expenses increased 1%, or $7.9 million, in 2015 compared to 2014. Selling and administrative expenses increased approximately 10 basis points as a percentage of net sales in 2015 compared to 2014. Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales by operating segment for 2015 and 2014 were as follows (dollars in thousands):\n North America's selling and administrative expenses increased 6%, or $23.7 million, in 2015 compared to 2014, but, as a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses decreased approximately 10 basis points to 10.4% of net sales in 2015. As discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report, our results for 2015 and 2014 include non-cash charges of $800,000 and $5.2 million, respectively, to reduce the carrying amount of our owned real estate in Bloomingdale, Illinois that was held for sale to its estimated fair value less costs to sell. Additionally, salaries and wages and contract labor increased $15.2 million year over year due to investments in sales and services personnel, variable compensation increased approximately $6.3 million year over year as a result of improved net sales and gross profit performance and teammate-related expenses increased $2.5 million year over year due primarily to an increase in healthcare benefit costs due to increased claims under self-insured programs.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nEMEA's selling and administrative expenses decreased 7%, or $12.9 million, in 2015 compared to 2014, but, as a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses increased approximately 50 basis points to 12.1% of net sales in 2015. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, selling and administrative expenses increased 5% in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase was primarily driven by higher salaries and wages from investments in sales and services related headcount to support services and Cloud growth across the region.\nAPAC's selling and administrative expenses decreased 11%, or $2.8 million, in 2015 compared to 2014, but, as a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses increased approximately 80 basis points to 12.6% of net sales in 2015. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, selling and administrative expenses increased 3% compared to the prior year. The increase from 2014 to 2015 is primarily driven by higher salaries and wages and from an increase in teammate-related expenses, partially offset by lower variable compensation based on net sales and gross profit performance in 2015 compared to 2014.\nSeverance and Restructuring Expenses. During 2015, North America and EMEA recorded severance expense, net of adjustments, totaling $1.1 million and $3.8 million, respectively, related to a continued review of resource needs in North America and additional restructuring activities in EMEA. In North America and EMEA, $1.5 million and $4.0 million, respectively, in new severance costs were offset by $418,000 and $182,000, respectively, of adjustments to prior severance accruals due to changes in estimates during 2015. During 2014, North America, EMEA and APAC recorded severance expense, net of adjustments, totaling $971,000, $3.4 million and $106,000, respectively. In North America and EMEA, $1.5 million and $3.9 million, respectively, in new severance costs were offset by $492,000 and $531,000, respectively, of adjustments to prior severance accruals due to changes in estimates during 2014. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further discussion of severance and restructuring activities.\nNon-Operating (Income) Expense.\nInterest Income. Interest income for 2015 and 2014 was generated from interest earned on cash and cash equivalent bank balances. The decrease in interest income from 2014 to 2015 is primarily due to lower average interest-bearing cash and cash equivalent balances and lower interest rates earned on such balances during 2015.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense primarily relates to borrowings under our financing facilities and imputed interest under our inventory financing facility. Interest expense increased 20% in 2015 compared to 2014 due primarily to higher average daily balances under our inventory financing facility in 2015 compared to 2014, resulting in an increase in imputed interest under the facility from $2.4 million in 2014 to $3.4 million in 2015. For a description of our various financing facilities, see Notes 5 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nNet Foreign Currency Exchange Gains/Losses. These gains/losses result from foreign currency transactions, including foreign currency derivative contracts and intercompany balances that are not considered long-term in nature. The change in net foreign currency exchange gains/losses is due primarily to the underlying changes in the applicable exchange rates, partially mitigated by our use of foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the effects of fluctuations in foreign currencies on certain of our non-functional currency assets and liabilities.\nOther Expense, Net. Other expense, net, consists primarily of bank fees associated with our cash management activities.\nIncome Tax Expense. Our effective tax rate for 2015 was 36.4% compared to 39.1% in 2014. The decrease in the tax rate from 2014 to 2015 was primarily due to reduced losses in certain foreign jurisdictions in 2015, resulting in less of an increase in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets related to these foreign operating losses. The effective tax rate in 2015 was higher than the federal statutory rate of 35.0% primarily due to state taxes in the United States as well as the increases in the valuation allowances in certain foreign jurisdictions. These increases in our effective tax rate in 2015 were offset partially by lower taxes on earnings in foreign jurisdictions. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further discussion of income tax expense.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table sets forth certain consolidated cash flow information for 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):\n Cash and Cash Flow\nOur primary uses of cash during 2016 were to fund working capital requirements, repurchase shares of our common stock, pay down our debt balances, fund capital expenditures and acquire Ignia. Operating activities provided $95.8 million in cash in 2016. Both the 2016 and 2015 results are affected by individually significant transactions at each year end, whereby a single significant receivable was collected from a client in the fourth quarter of the year for which the related payment to the supplier was due and paid in January of the following year, as discussed in more detail below. During 2016, we repurchased $50.0 million of our common stock, made net combined repayments on our long-term debt facilities of $49.5 million and acquired Ignia for $10.8 million, net of cash acquired. Capital expenditures were $12.3 million in 2016, a 9% decrease from 2015, reflecting lower IT investments year to year. Cash and cash equivalent balances in 2016 and 2015 were negatively affected by $1.8 million and $16.7 million, respectively, as a result of foreign currency exchange rates.\nWe anticipate that cash flows from operations, together with the funds available under our financing facilities, will be adequate to support our presently anticipated cash and working capital requirements for operations as well as other strategic investments over the next 12 months. We currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate any foreign undistributed earnings. We expect existing domestic cash and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating cash activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as capital expenditures and debt repayments, for at least the next 12 months.\nNet cash provided by operating activities. Cash flows from operating activities reflect our net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items such as depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense and write-offs and write-downs of assets, as well as changes in asset and liability balances. In 2016, the increases in accounts receivable and accounts payable reflect increased sales and associated costs of goods sold, respectively, in 2016 compared to 2015. However, the 2016 results are also affected by a single significant receivable collected from a client in the fourth quarter of 2016 for which the related payment to the supplier of approximately $160 million was due and paid in January 2017, as noted previously. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we had a similar experience with a significant receivable collected in the quarter for which the payment to the supplier of approximately $60 million was not made until the first quarter of 2016. Excluding the effects of these two individually significant timing differences, cash flow from operations would have been nominal for 2016. Additionally, the increase in accounts payable reflected as cash provided by operating activities in 2016 is affected by the increased use of our inventory financing facility in 2016 to facilitate the purchase of inventory from various suppliers. Increases in accounts payable under this facility are reflected as cash provided by financing activities, as discussed below. Had these purchases been made without using the inventory financing facility during 2016, the net borrowings under our inventory financing facility of $48.6 million that are reflected as cash flows from financing activities would have been reflected as an increase in accounts payable, which would be an increase in cash provided by operating activities. We used more working capital in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, as our sales growth was weighted to the last two months of the current year. The $50.1 million increase in other assets was primarily a result of our deferral of costs for certain payments made or payable to partners at December 31, 2016, in advance of our being able to recognize the related revenue. The $28.9 million increase in inventories was primarily attributable to an increase in inventory levels at December 31, 2016, to support specific client engagements and hardware sale transactions in transit to clients as of December 31, 2016 such that delivery was not deemed to have occurred until the product was received by the client in early January 2017.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nIn 2015, the increases in accounts receivable and accounts payable reflect increased sales and associated costs of goods sold, respectively, in 2015 compared to 2014. However, the 2015 results are also affected by the single significant receivable collected from a client in the fourth quarter of 2015 for which the related payment to the supplier of approximately $60 million was due and paid in January 2016, as noted previously. The increase in other assets was primarily a result of our deferral of costs for certain payments made or payable to partners at December 31, 2015, in advance of our being able to recognize the related revenue. As a result, cash flows from operating activities in 2015 exceeded our historical average annual cash flow generation of $80 million to $120 million.\nIn 2014, the increases in accounts receivable and accounts payable reflect increased sales and associated costs of goods sold, respectively, in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase in inventories is primarily attributable to an increase in inventory levels at December 31, 2014, to support specific client engagements and hardware sale transactions in transit to clients as of December 31, 2014 such that delivery was not deemed to have occurred until the product was received by the client in early January 2015. The decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities in 2014 was primarily due to the relative timing of sales tax and VAT payments in 2014 compared to 2013.\nOur consolidated cash flow operating metrics for the quarters ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 are as follows:\n\n (a) Calculated as the balance of accounts receivable, net at the end of the period divided by daily net sales. Daily net sales is calculated as net sales for the quarter divided by 92 days. \n (b) Calculated as average inventories (excluding inventories not available for sale) divided by daily costs of goods sold. Average inventories is calculated as the sum of the balances of inventories at the beginning of the period plus inventories at the end of the period divided by two. Daily costs of goods sold is calculated as costs of goods sold for the quarter divided by 92 days. \n (c) Calculated as the sum of the balances of accounts payable - trade and accounts payable - inventory financing facility at the end of the period divided by daily costs of goods sold. Daily costs of goods sold is calculated as costs of goods sold for the quarter divided by 92 days. \n (d) Calculated as DSOs plus DIOs, less DPOs.  Our cash conversion cycle was 14 days in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of six days from the fourth quarter of 2015, due primarily to an 11 day increase in DPOs driven by a single significant payment to a supplier in North America that was due and paid in January 2017. Although the payment to the supplier was not due until after year-end, we collected on the accounts receivable from the client in the fourth quarter of 2016 under normal credit terms. Both the 2016 and 2015 results are affected by individually significant transactions at each year end; however, the magnitude of the 2016 transaction had a greater effect on DPOs. The computation of DPOs for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 includes a payable to a supplier of $160 million, and the computation of DPOs for the quarter ended December 30, 2015 includes a payable to a supplier of $60 million, both of which do not have corresponding accounts receivable outstanding as of the respective period ends.\nOur cash conversion cycle was 20 days in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of four days from the fourth quarter of 2014, due primarily to an increase in DPOs in North America driven by a single significant payment to a supplier that was due and paid in January 2016, after the resolution of certain invoicing issues with the supplier. Although we did not pay the supplier until after year-end, we collected on the accounts receivable from the client in the fourth quarter of 2015 under normal credit terms.\nOur cash conversion cycle was 24 days in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2014, an improvement of three days from the fourth quarter of 2013, due primarily to higher DPOs in North America driven by the timing of payments to suppliers during the quarter ended December 31, 2014 offset by a one day increase in DIOs due to the increase in inventories discussed above.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nWe expect that cash flow from operations will be used, at least partially, to fund working capital as we typically pay our partners on average terms that are shorter than the average terms we grant to our clients in order to take advantage of supplier discounts. We intend to use cash generated in 2017 in excess of working capital needs to support our capital expenditures for the year and to pay down our debt balances. We also may use cash to fund potential acquisitions to add select capabilities.\nNet cash used in investing activities. Capital expenditures of $12.3 million, $13.4 million and $10.0 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, were primarily related to technology and facility enhancements. We expect total capital expenditures in 2017 to be between $15.0 million and $20.0 million, primarily for technology-related upgrade projects and integration of acquisitions.\nDuring 2016, we acquired Ignia for $10.8 million, net of cash acquired, and during 2015, we acquired BlueMetal for $44.2 million, net of cash acquired.\nNet cash used in financing activities. During 2016, we made net combined repayments on our long-term debt under our revolving facility and our accounts receivable securitization facility (\u201cABS facility\u201d) of $49.5 million and had net borrowings under our inventory financing facility of $48.6 million. In 2016, we also funded $50.0 million of repurchases of our common stock. During 2015, we had net combined borrowings on our long-term debt under our revolving facility and our ABS facility of $28.0 million and made net repayments under our inventory financing facility of $16.5 million. In 2015, we also funded $91.8 million of repurchases of our common stock. During 2014, we had net combined repayments on our long-term debt under our revolving facility and our ABS facility of $5.5 million and had net borrowings under our inventory financing facility of $7.5 million. In 2014, we also funded $50.4 million of repurchases of our common stock.\nFinancing Facilities\nOn June 23, 2016, we entered into amendments to our revolving facility, our ABS facility and our inventory financing facility.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our long-term debt balance consisted of $39.5 million outstanding under our $250.0 million ABS facility and no amounts outstanding under our $350.0 million revolving facility. As of December 31, 2016, the current portion of our long-term debt relates solely to our capital lease obligations. Our objective is to pay our debt balances down while retaining adequate cash balances to meet overall business objectives.\nOn January 6, 2017, we funded the acquisition of Datalink through a combination of cash on hand and approximately $196.0 million in borrowings under our revolving facility. In conjunction with the acquisition, we amended our revolving facility to expand the facility by $175.0 million in the form of a Term Loan A that requires amortization payments in years one through five. We anticipate that these additional borrowings will increase our 2017 interest expense by approximately $6 million compared to interest expense incurred in 2016 and will require additional cash to fund interest and amortization payments over the term of the loan. See Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a description of our amendment to our revolving facility in conjunction with our acquisition of Datalink.\nWhile the ABS facility has a stated maximum amount, the actual availability under the ABS facility is limited by the quantity and quality of the underlying accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2016, qualified receivables were sufficient to permit access to the full $250.0 million under the ABS facility.\nOur consolidated debt balance that can be outstanding at the end of any fiscal quarter under our revolving facility and our ABS facility is limited by certain financial covenants, particularly a maximum leverage ratio. The maximum leverage ratio is calculated as aggregate debt outstanding divided by the sum of the Company's trailing twelve month net earnings (loss) plus (i) interest expense, excluding non-cash imputed interest on our inventory financing facility, (ii) income tax expense (benefit), (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) non-cash stock-based compensation, (v) extraordinary or non-recurring non-cash losses or expenses and (vi) certain cash restructuring and acquisition-related charges, not to exceed specified caps (\u201cadjusted earnings\u201d). The maximum leverage ratio permitted under the facilities was increased from 2.75 times to 3.00 times trailing twelve-month adjusted earnings in conjunction with the amendments to the facilities in June 2016 and may increase to 3.50 times trailing twelve-month adjusted earnings in certain circumstances. The maximum ratio was increased in conjunction with the acquisition of Datalink in January 2017. See Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. We anticipate that we will be in compliance with our maximum leverage ratio requirements over the next four quarters. However, a significant drop in the Company's adjusted earnings would limit the amount of indebtedness that could be outstanding at the end of any fiscal quarter to a level that would be below the Company's consolidated maximum facility amounts. Based on the maximum permitted leverage ratio as of December 31, 2016, the Company's debt balance that could have been outstanding under our revolving facility and our ABS facility was the full amount of the maximum borrowing capacity of $600.0 million.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nOur revolving facility and our ABS facility contain various covenants customary for transactions of this type, including limitations on the payment of dividends and the requirement that we comply with maximum leverage and minimum fixed charge ratio requirements, comply with a minimum receivable requirement and meet monthly, quarterly and annual reporting requirements. If we fail to comply with these covenants, the lenders would be able to demand payment within a specified time period. At December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all such covenants. Further, the terms of the ABS facility identify various circumstances that would result in an \u201camortization event\u201d under the facility. At December 31, 2016, no such \u201camortization event\u201d had occurred.\nWe also have an agreement with a financial intermediary to facilitate the purchase of inventory from various suppliers under certain terms and conditions. These amounts are classified separately as accounts payable - inventory financing facility in our consolidated balance sheets.\nThe aggregate availability for vendor purchases under our inventory financing facility is $325,000,000. From time to time and at our option, we may request to increase the aggregate amount available under the inventory financing facility by up to an aggregate of $25,000,000, subject to customary conditions. The facility matures on June 23, 2021. Additionally, the facility may be renewed under certain circumstances described in the agreement for successive 12-month periods. Interest does not accrue on accounts payable under this facility provided the accounts payable are paid within stated vendor terms (ranging from 30 to 60 days).\nNotes 5 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report also include: a description of our financing facilities; amounts outstanding; amounts available and weighted average borrowings and interest rates during the year.\nUndistributed Foreign Earnings\nCash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation upon repatriation to the United States. We do not provide for U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of those of our foreign subsidiaries where earnings are reinvested and, in the opinion of management, will continue to be reinvested indefinitely outside of the United States. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $179.9 million in cash and cash equivalents in certain of our foreign subsidiaries where we consider undistributed earnings of these foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested. As of December 31, 2016, the majority of our foreign cash resides in the Netherlands, Canada, Australia, Russia and the United Kingdom. Certain of these cash balances will be remitted to the United States by paying down intercompany payables generated in the ordinary course of business. This repayment would not change our policy to indefinitely reinvest earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are deemed to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States were approximately $105.3 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $88.9 million at the end of 2015. We intend to use undistributed earnings for general business purposes in the foreign jurisdictions as well as to fund our capital expenditures and potential acquisitions.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have entered into off-balance sheet arrangements, which include guaranties and indemnifications. These arrangements are discussed in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. We believe that none of our off-balance sheet arrangements have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition, sales or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nContractual Obligations\nAt December 31, 2016, our contractual obligations for continuing operations were as follows (in thousands):\n\n (a) Reflects the $39.5 million outstanding at December 31, 2016 under our ABS facility as due in June 2019, the date at which the facility matures. See further discussion in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. \n (b) As of December 31, 2016, this amount has been included in our contractual obligations table above as being due in less than 1 year due to the 30- to 60-day stated vendor terms. See further discussion in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. \n (c) Amounts in the table above exclude non-cancellable rental income of approximately $1.5 million due in less than one year and a total of approximately $3.2 million due in years one through three. \n (d) As a result of approved severance and restructuring plans, we expect future cash expenditures related to employee termination benefits. See further discussion in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. \n (e) The table above includes: \n I. Estimated interest payments of $751,000 in 2017 and 2018 and $375,000 in the first six months of 2019, based on the current debt balance at December 31, 2016 of $39.5 million under our ABS facility, multiplied by the weighted average interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 of 1.9% per annum. \n II. Amounts totaling $388,000 through 2018 for other contractual obligations. \n III. We estimate that we will owe $6.8 million in future years in connection with the obligations to perform asset-retirement activities that are conditional on a future event. \nThe table above excludes $2.2 million of unrecognized tax benefits, including $195,000 related to accrued interest, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See further discussion in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nAlthough we set purchase targets with our partners tied to the amount of supplier reimbursements we receive, we have no material contractual purchase obligations with our partners.\nAcquisitions\nOur strategy includes the possible acquisition of or investments in other businesses to expand or complement our operations or to add select services capabilities. The magnitude, timing and nature of any future acquisitions or investments will depend on a number of factors, including the availability of suitable candidates, the negotiation of acceptable terms, our financial capabilities and general economic and business conditions. Financing for future transactions would result in the utilization of cash, incurrence of additional debt, issuance of stock or some combination of the three. See Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a discussion of our acquisition of Datalink on January 6, 2017 and the amendment to our revolving facility to fund, in part, the acquisition.\nInflation\nWe have historically not been adversely affected by inflation, as technological advances and competition within the IT industry have generally caused the prices of the products we sell to decline and product life cycles tend to be short. This requires our growth in unit sales to exceed the decline in prices in order to increase our net sales. We believe that most price increases could be passed on to our clients, as prices charged by us are not set by long-term contracts; however, as a result of competitive pressure, there can be no assurance that the full effect of any such price increases could be passed on to our clients.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF

"summary": "The following is a summary of the report provided:\n\n- Financial Overview:\n  Insight Enterprises, Inc., a Fortune 500-ranked global IT provider, has presented its financial data for five years up to December 31, 2016. It details audited financial statements and significant growth in both North America and the international market.\n\n- Consolidated Financial Highlights for 2016:\n  Net sales increased by 2% to $5.5 billion compared to 2015 due to growth across several sectors, particularly in North America. Gross profit also saw a 4% increase, and earnings from operations rose by 18%. The net earnings and diluted net earnings per share were $84.7 million and $2.32, respectively. Several acquisitions contributed to financial performance, including Ignia and the integration of BlueMetal into the business.\n\n- Investing and Financing Activities:\n  Insight Enterprises spent $12.3 million on capital expenditures, which was slightly less than in 2015. The company acquired Ignia for $10.8 million and returned $50 million to shareholders through stock repurchases. \n\n- Financial Position:\n  The company highlighted strong cash flow from operations at $95.8 million, though this was lower than $180.5 million in 2015 due to significant transactions at year-end.
