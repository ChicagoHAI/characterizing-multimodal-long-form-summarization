Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nMANAGEMENT OVERVIEW\nANGI Homeservices Inc. (\"ANGI Homeservices,\" the \"Company,\" \"ANGI,\" \"we,\" \"our,\" or \"us\") connects millions of homeowners to home service professionals through its portfolio of digital home service brands, including HomeAdvisor\u00ae, Angie's List\u00ae and Handy. Combined, these leading marketplaces have collected more than 15 million reviews over the course of 20 years, allowing homeowners to research, match and connect on-demand to the largest network of service professionals online, through our mobile apps, or by voice assistants. ANGI Homeservices owns and operates brands in eight countries.\nThe HomeAdvisor digital marketplace service connects consumers with service professionals nationwide for home repair, maintenance and improvement projects. HomeAdvisor provides consumers with tools and resources to help them find local, pre-screened and customer-rated service professionals, as well as instantly book appointments with those professionals online or connect with them by telephone. Effective September 29, 2017, the Company also owns and operates Angie's List, Inc. (\"Angie's List\"), which connects consumers with service professionals for local services through a nationwide online directory of service professionals in over 700 service categories and provides consumers with valuable tools, services and content, including verified reviews, to help them research, shop and hire for local services. On October 19, 2018, the Company acquired Handy Technologies, Inc. (\"Handy\"), a leading platform in the United States for connecting individuals looking for household services (primarily cleaning and handyman services) with top-quality, pre-screened independent service professionals. We refer to the HomeAdvisor and Handy businesses in the United States as the (\"Marketplace\"). We also own and operate mHelpDesk and CraftJack. Prior to its sale on December 31, 2018, we also operated Felix.\nThe Company has two operating segments: (i) North America (United States and Canada), which includes HomeAdvisor, Angie's List, Handy, mHelpDesk and HomeStars, and (ii) Europe, which includes Travaux, MyHammer, MyBuilder, Werkspot and Instapro.\nThe Company markets its services to consumers through search engine marketing, television advertising and affiliate agreements with third parties. Pursuant to these affiliate agreements, third parties agree to advertise and promote Marketplace products and services and those of Marketplace service professionals on their platforms. In exchange for these efforts, the Company generally pays these third parties a fixed fee when visitors from their platforms click through to one of our platforms and submit a valid service request through the Marketplace, or when visitors submit a valid service request on the affiliate platform and the affiliate transmits the service request to the Marketplace. The Company also markets its services to consumers through email, digital display advertisements, partnerships with other contextually related websites and, to a lesser extent, through relationships with certain retailers, direct mail and radio advertising. The Company markets subscription packages and time-based advertising to service professionals primarily through its sales force, as well as through search engine marketing, digital media advertising and direct relationships with trade associations and manufacturers. We have made, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in digital and traditional advertising (with continued expansion into new and existing digital platforms) to consumers and service professionals to promote our products and services and to drive traffic to our various platforms and service professionals.\nOperating Metrics:\nIn connection with the management of our businesses, we identify, measure and assess a variety of operating metrics. The principal metrics we use in managing our businesses are set forth below:\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Marketplace Revenue includes revenue from the HomeAdvisor and Handy domestic marketplace service, including consumer connection revenue for consumer matches, membership subscription revenue from HomeAdvisor service professionals and revenue from completed jobs sourced through the Handy platform. It excludes revenue from Angie's List, mHelpDesk, HomeStars and Felix.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Advertising & Other Revenue includes Angie's List revenue (revenue from service professionals under contract for advertising and membership subscription fees from consumers) as well as revenue from mHelpDesk, HomeStars and Felix.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Marketplace Service Requests are fully completed and submitted domestic customer service requests to HomeAdvisor and completed jobs sourced through the Handy platform.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Marketplace Paying Service Professionals (\"Marketplace Paying SPs\") are the number of HomeAdvisor and Handy domestic service professionals that had an active subscription and/or paid for consumer matches or completed\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\na job sourced through the Handy platform in the last month of the period. An active HomeAdvisor subscription is a subscription for which HomeAdvisor was recognizing revenue on the last day of the relevant period.\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Advertising Service Professionals are the total number of Angie's List service professionals under contract for advertising at the end of the period.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Components of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nMarketplace Revenue is primarily derived from (i) consumer connection revenue, which comprises fees paid by HomeAdvisor service professionals for consumer matches (regardless of whether the service professional ultimately provides the requested service) and booking fees from completed jobs sourced through the Handy platform, and (ii) membership subscription fees paid by HomeAdvisor service professionals. Consumer connection revenue varies based upon several factors, including the service requested, product experience offered and geographic location of service. Effective with the Combination (described below), Advertising & Other Revenue is primarily derived from Angie's List (i) sales of time-based website, mobile and call center advertising to service professionals and (ii) membership subscription fees from consumers.\nOperating Costs and Expenses:\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Cost of revenue - consists primarily of traffic acquisition costs, credit card processing fees, costs associated with publishing and distributing the Angie's List Magazine and hosting fees. Traffic acquisition costs include amounts based on revenue share arrangements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Selling and marketing expense - consists primarily of advertising expenditures, which include online marketing, including fees paid to search engines, offline marketing, which is primarily television advertising, and partner-related payments to those who direct traffic to our brands, compensation expense (including stock-based compensation expense) and other employee-related costs for our sales force and marketing personnel, and facilities costs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>General and administrative expense - consists primarily of compensation expense (including stock-based compensation expense) and other employee-related costs for personnel engaged in executive management, finance, legal, tax, human resources and customer service functions, fees for professional services (including transaction-related costs related to acquisitions and the Combination), bad debt expense, software license and maintenance costs and facilities costs. Our customer service function includes personnel who provide support to our service professionals and consumers.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Product development expense - consists primarily of compensation expense (including stock-based compensation expense) and other employee-related costs that are not capitalized for personnel engaged in the design, development, testing and enhancement of product offerings and related technology, software license and maintenance costs and facilities costs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Non-GAAP financial measure\nAdjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (\"Adjusted EBITDA\") is a non-GAAP financial measure. See \"Principles of Financial Reporting\" for the definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net earnings (loss) attributable to ANGI Homeservices Inc. shareholders to operating income (loss) to consolidated and combined Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016.\nThe Combination\nOn September 29, 2017, IAC/InterActiveCorp's (\"IAC\") HomeAdvisor business and Angie's List combined under a new publicly traded company called ANGI Homeservices Inc. (the \"Combination\"). At December 31, 2018, IAC owned 83.9% and 98.1% of the economic and voting interest, respectively, of ANGI Homeservices.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company incurred $3.6 million and $44.1 million, respectively, in costs related to this transaction (including severance, retention, transaction and integration related costs). In addition, the Company had deferred revenue write-offs of $5.5 million and $7.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe Company also incurred $70.6 million and $122.1 million in stock-based compensation expense during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, related to the modification of previously issued HomeAdvisor equity awards and previously issued Angie's List equity awards, both of which were converted into ANGI Homeservices' equity awards in the Combination, and the acceleration of certain converted equity awards resulting from the termination of Angie's List employees in connection with the Combination. Stock-based compensation expense arising from the Combination is expected to be approximately $35 million in 2019 and $20 million in 2020.\n2018 Developments\nOn December 31, 2018, ANGI sold Felix, which was included in our North America segment.\nOn November 5, 2018, ANGI entered into a five-year $250 million revolving credit facility (the \"Credit Facility\") and the term loan facility (the \"Term Loan\") was amended and restated, and is now due on November 5, 2023.\nOn October 19, 2018, ANGI acquired Handy, which is included in our North America segment.\n2018 Consolidated Results\nIn 2018, the Company delivered $395.9 million, or 54%, revenue growth, which was primarily driven by Marketplace Revenue growth of $193.1 million, or 33%; the contribution from Angie's List; and growth in Europe of $12.6 million, or 22%. Operating income increased $211.8 million to $63.9 million from a loss of $147.9 million in the prior year due primarily to an increase in Adjusted EBITDA of $208.3 million, or 532%, and a decrease of $52.2 million in stock-based compensation expense due primarily to a decrease in the modification and acceleration charges of $51.4 million related to the Combination, partially offset by increases of $39.0 million in amortization of intangibles principally due to the Combination and $9.8 million in depreciation. Adjusted EBITDA increased primarily due to the increase in revenue of $395.9 million, a decrease of $40.5 million in costs related to the Combination (including severance, retention, transaction and integration related costs) and lower selling and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue, partially offset by higher compensation expense due, in part, to increased headcount following the Combination, increases of $21.7 million in cost of revenue, $19.7 million in bad debt expense, $15.2 million in software license and maintenance costs and $9.4 million in facilities costs. Operating income and Adjusted EBITDA in 2018 benefited from a reduction in sales commissions expense of $4.9 million due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers on January 1, 2018. As a result of the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09, certain sales commissions, which represent the incremental direct costs of obtaining a service professional contract, are now capitalized and amortized over the estimated life of a service professional; these costs were expensed as incurred prior to January 1, 2018.\nIn addition to the Combination, other events affecting year-over-year comparability that occurred prior to 2018 include the acquisitions of controlling interests in MyBuilder Limited (\"MyBuilder\") on March 24, 2017 (reflected in the Europe segment) and HomeStars Inc. (\"HomeStars\") on February 8, 2017 (reflected in the North America segment).\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016\nRevenue\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td>

applicable\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017\nNorth America revenue increased $383.3 million, or 56%, due to increases in Marketplace Revenue of $193.1 million, or 33%, and Advertising & Other Revenue of $190.2 million, or 195%. The increase in Marketplace Revenue is due to an increase in consumer connection revenue of $182.9 million, or 35%, which was driven by a 30% increase in Marketplace Service Requests to 23.5 million and an increase in membership subscription revenue of $10.1 million, or 18%, due to a 18% increase in Marketplace Paying SPs to 214,000. The increase in Advertising & Other Revenue was driven by the contribution from Angie's List, which reflects the write-off of deferred revenue due to the Combination of $5.5 million in 2018 compared to $7.8 million in 2017.\nEurope revenue grew $12.6 million, or 22%, driven by the acquisition of a controlling interest in MyBuilder on March 24, 2017, as well as growth across other regions. Europe revenue also benefited from the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to the Euro.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nNorth America revenue increased $217.1 million, or 47%, due to increases in Marketplace Revenue of $152.5 million, or 36%, and Advertising & Other Revenue of $64.5 million, or 196%. The increase in Marketplace Revenue is due to an increase in consumer connection revenue of $139.0 million, or 36%, which was driven by a 37% increase in Marketplace Service\nRequests to 18.1 million and an increase in membership subscription revenue of $12.6 million, or 29%, due to a 26% increase in Marketplace Paying SPs to 181,000. Advertising & Other Revenue in 2017 includes Angie's List since the date of the Combination, which reflects the write-off of deferred revenue due to the Combination of $7.8 million.\nEurope revenue grew $20.4 million, or 55%, driven by the acquisitions of controlling interests in MyHammer on November 3, 2016 and MyBuilder, as well as organic growth across other regions.\nCost of revenue\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation shown separately below)\n</td> <td>$55,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$21,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$34,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$8,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$25,858\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017\nNorth America cost of revenue increased $21.5 million, or 66%, driven by increases of $7.2 million in traffic acquisition costs, $6.9 million in credit card processing fees due to $3.5 million from the inclusion of Angie's List and higher Marketplace Revenue, $3.7 million in costs associated with publishing and distributing the Angie's List Magazine and $2.6 million in hosting fees, principally from the inclusion of Angie's List.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nNorth America cost of revenue increased $7.2 million, or 28%, driven by increases of $4.2 million in credit card processing fees due to higher Marketplace Revenue and $1.4 million from the inclusion of Angie's List, and $2.1 million in hosting fees, of which $1.3 million was from the inclusion of Angie's List, partially offset by a reduction in traffic acquisition costs of $0.4 million.\nEurope cost of revenue increased $1.0 million, or 383%, driven by an increase of $0.9 million in hosting fees.\nSelling and marketing expense\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling and marketing expense\n</td> <td>$541,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$77,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$464,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$157,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$306,713\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>48%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017\nNorth America selling and marketing expense increased $73.5 million, or 17%, but declined as a percentage of revenue. The increase in North America selling and marketing expense was driven by increases in advertising expense of $53.0 million, reflecting the impact from the inclusion of Angie's List, compensation expense of $11.8 million and facilities costs of $4.0 million. The increase in advertising expense is due primarily to increased investments in online marketing and television spend. Compensation expense increased due primarily to growth in the sales force, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense of $22.4 million and the inclusion of $7.4 million in severance and retention costs in 2017 related to the Combination. The decrease in stock-based compensation expense reflects decreases of $13.3 million in expense due to the modification of previously issued HomeAdvisor equity awards, which were converted into ANGI Homeservices' equity awards ($1.6 million in 2018 compared to $14.8 million in 2017), and $9.0 million in expense related to previously issued Angie's List equity awards, including the acceleration of certain converted equity awards resulting from the termination of Angie's List employees in connection with the Combination ($0.6 million in 2018 compared to $9.6 million in 2017). Compensation expense in 2018 also reflects a reduction in sales commissions expense of $4.9 million due to the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09. As a percentage of revenue, North America selling and marketing expense declined due, in part, to accelerated revenue growth driven by capacity expansion efforts combined with marketing optimization efforts.\nEurope selling and marketing expense increased $4.0 million, or 11%, driven by $3.6 million of increased expense from the inclusion of MyBuilder, principally related to advertising, and increases in compensation expense of $1.0 million and facilities costs of $1.0 million, partially offset by a decrease in advertising expense of $2.5 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nNorth America selling and marketing expense increased $142.8 million, or 50%, driven by an increase in advertising expense of $73.3 million, of which $5.3 million was from the inclusion of Angie's List, an increase of $62.4 million in compensation expense, of which $24.4 million was from the inclusion of Angie's List, as well as $2.5 million of expense from the acquisition of HomeStars. The increase in advertising expense is due primarily to increased organic investments in online marketing and television spend. Compensation expense increased due primarily to an increase of $24.9 million in stock-based compensation expense, of which $9.8 million was from the inclusion of Angie's List, an increase in the sales force and the inclusion of $7.4 million in severance and retention costs related to the Combination. The increase in stock-based compensation expense reflects $14.8 million of expense in 2017 due to the modification of previously issued HomeAdvisor equity awards, which were converted into ANGI Homeservices' equity awards, and $9.6 million of expense in 2017 related to previously issued Angie's List equity awards, including the acceleration of certain converted equity awards resulting from the termination of Angie's List employees in connection with the Combination.\nEurope selling and marketing expense increased $14.5 million, or 65%, driven by organic growth of $4.9 million in advertising expense and $2.5 million in compensation expense due, in part, to an increase in the sales force, as well as $7.0 million of expense from the acquisitions of MyHammer and MyBuilder.\nGeneral and administrative expense\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expense\n</td> <td>$323,462\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$23,029\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$300,433\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$190,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>173%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$110,093\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>29%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017\nNorth America general and administrative expense increased $24.9 million, or 9%, due primarily to an increase of $19.5 million in bad debt expense due, in part, to higher Marketplace Revenue, increases of $9.4 million in software license and maintenance costs and $3.7 million in facilities costs, both reflecting the impact from the inclusion of Angie's List, and an increase in customer service expense of $3.4 million, partially offset by a reduction in transaction and integration-related costs principally related to the Combination of $21.1 million. North America general and administrative expense also includes an increase in compensation expense of $1.0 million. The increase in compensation expense is due primarily to an increase in headcount following the Combination and existing business growth as well as $3.8 million from the inclusion of Handy, almost entirely offset by a decrease of $24.9 million in stock-based compensation expense and a decrease of $9.2 million in severance and retention costs related to the Combination ($2.7 million in 2018 compared to $11.8 million in 2017).

The increase in compensation expense is due principally to an increase of $100.7 million in stock-based compensation expense, of which $18.0 million was from the inclusion of Angie's List, an increase in headcount from business growth and the inclusion of $11.8 million in severance and retention costs in 2017 related to the Combination. The increase in stock-based compensation expense reflects $65.7 million of expense in 2017 due to the modification of previously issued HomeAdvisor equity awards, which were converted into ANGI Homeservices' equity awards, and $17.7 million of expense in 2017 related to previously issued Angie's List equity awards, including the acceleration of certain converted equity awards resulting from the termination of Angie's List employees in connection with the Combination, as well as a modification charge related to a HomeAdvisor equity award in 2017.

Additionally, Europe Adjusted EBITDA loss in 2017 includes $0.8 million of transaction-related costs primarily related to the acquisition of MyBuilder.\nAdjusted EBITDA in 2018 benefited from a reduction in sales commissions expense of $4.9 million for North America due to the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 on January 1, 2018.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nNorth America Adjusted EBITDA increased $0.1 million, despite the significant increase of $217.1 million in revenue, due primarily to an increase in advertising expense of $73.3 million, higher compensation expense due, in part, to increased headcount, the inclusion in 2017 of $44.1 million in costs related to the Combination (including severance, retention, transaction and integration related costs) and increases of $9.3 million in bad debt expense due to higher revenue, $3.9 million in customer service expense and $3.1 million in software license and maintenance costs. Adjusted EBITDA in 2017 was further impacted by write-offs of deferred revenue related to the Combination of $7.8 million and the acquisition of HomeStars of $0.7 million.\nEurope Adjusted EBITDA loss increased $5.5 million, or 99%, driven primarily by our European expansion strategy including an increase in advertising expense of $10.7 million and higher compensation expense of $10.5 million both due primarily to the inclusion of MyHammer and MyBuilder. The increase in compensation expense was also due to increased organic headcount.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense-third-party relates to interest on the Term Loan, which commenced on November 1, 2017 and commitment fees on the undrawn Credit Facility, which commenced on November 5, 2018.\nInterest expense-related party includes interest charged by IAC and its subsidiaries on related party notes, which were primarily related to acquisitions.

The Tax Act implemented a number of changes that took effect on January 1, 2018, including but not limited to, a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and a new minimum tax on global intangible low-taxed income earned by foreign subsidiaries. The Company was able to make a reasonable estimate of the impacts of the Tax Act in the fourth quarter of 2017 as described below. In the third quarter of 2018, the Company finalized its calculations related to the impacts of the Tax Act with no adjustment in 2018 to the Company's previously recorded provisional tax expense.\nIn 2017, the effective income tax rate is lower than the statutory rate of 35% due primarily to the effect of the Tax Act, largely offset by adopting the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, on January 1, 2017. The Tax Act required a remeasurement of U.S. net deferred tax assets due to the reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, resulting in a tax expense of $33.0 million. The Company was not subject to the one-time transition tax because it has cumulative losses from its international operations. Under ASU No. 2016-09, excess tax benefits generated by the settlement or exercise of stock-based awards of $35.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 are recognized as a reduction to the income tax provision rather than as an increase to additional paid-in capital.\nIn 2016, the effective income tax rate is higher than the statutory rate of 35% due primarily to unbenefited losses in separate jurisdictions and state taxes, partially offset by research credits.\nFor further details of income tax matters, see \"Note 3-Income Taxes\" to the consolidated and combined financial statements included in \"Item 8. Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL REPORTING\nWe report Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). This measure is one of the primary metrics by which we evaluate the performance of our businesses, on which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated. We believe that investors should have access to, and we are obligated to provide, the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results. This non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. We endeavor to compensate for the limitations of the non-GAAP measure presented by providing the comparable GAAP measure with equal or greater prominence and descriptions of the reconciling items, including quantifying such items, to derive the non-GAAP measure. We encourage investors to examine the reconciling adjustments between the GAAP and non-GAAP measure, which we discuss below.\nDefinition of Non-GAAP Measure\nAdjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (\"Adjusted EBITDA\") is defined as operating income excluding: (1) stock-based compensation expense; (2) depreciation; and (3) acquisition-related items consisting of amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets, if applicable. We believe this measure is useful for analysts and investors as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison between our performance and that of our competitors. The above items are excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA measure because these items are non-cash in nature. Adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to our consolidated and combined statement of operations of certain expenses.\nThe following table reconciles net earnings (loss) attributable to ANGI Homeservices Inc. shareholders to operating income (loss) to consolidated and combined Adjusted EBITDA:\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net earnings (loss) attributable to ANGI Homeservices Inc. shareholders\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(103,118\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add back:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,409\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,497\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax (benefit) provision\n</td> <td>(7,483\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(49,106\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (income) expense, net\n</td> <td>(17,859\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,974\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>699\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense-related party\n</td> <td>118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>894\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense-third-party\n</td> <td>11,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>63,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(147,871\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>97,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>149,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation\n</td> <td>24,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,419\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangibles\n</td> <td>62,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>247,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor a reconciliation of operating income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA for the Company's reportable segments, see \"Note 12-Segment Information\" to the consolidated and combined financial statements included in \"Item 8. Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nNon-Cash Expenses That Are Excluded from Non-GAAP Measure\nStock-based compensation expense consists principally of expense associated with the grants, including unvested grants assumed in acquisitions (including the Combination), of stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units, or RSUs, stock options and performance-based RSUs. These expenses are not paid in cash, and we include the related shares in our fully diluted shares outstanding using the treasury stock method. Performance-based RSUs are included only to the extent the applicable performance condition(s) have been met (assuming the end of the reporting period is the end of the contingency period). To the extent that stock-based awards are settled on a net basis, the Company remits the required tax-withholding amount from its current funds.\nDepreciation is a non-cash expense relating to our property and equipment and is computed using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated useful lives, or, in the case of leasehold improvements, the lease term, if shorter.\nAmortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets are non-cash expenses related primarily to acquisitions (including the Combination). At the time of an acquisition, the identifiable definite-lived intangible assets of the acquired company, such as service professional and contractor relationships, technology, memberships, customer lists and user base, and trade names, are valued and amortized over their estimated lives. Value is also assigned to acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets, which comprise trade names and trademarks, and goodwill that are not subject to amortization. An impairment is recorded when the carrying value of an intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value. We believe that intangible assets represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to acquisition and the related amortization and impairment charges of intangible assets or goodwill, if applicable, are not ongoing costs of doing business.\nFINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nFinancial Position Table 98: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>328,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>214,803\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All other countries (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>336,984\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>221,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Marketable securities (United States)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,947\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>361,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>221,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term Loan due November 5, 2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>261,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>275,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: current portion of Term Loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: unamortized debt issuance costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,529\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total long-term debt, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>244,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>258,312\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt-related party\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,813\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: current portion of long-term debt-related party\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>816\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total long-term debt-related party, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,997\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_________________________________________________________________________\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>If needed for U.S. operations, the cash and cash equivalents held by the Company's foreign subsidiaries could be repatriated without significant tax consequences.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> For a detailed description of long-term debt, see \"Note 7-Long-term Debt\" and for a detailed description of long-term debt-related party, see \"Note 15-Related Party Transactions with IAC\" to the consolidated and combined financial statements included in \"Item 8.

Non-cash adjustments include stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangibles, bad debt expense, depreciation, gain from the sale of a business, and deferred income taxes.\nAdjustments to earnings consist primarily of $97.1 million of stock-based compensation expense, $62.2 million of amortization of intangibles, $47.2 million of bad debt expense and $24.3 million of depreciation, partially offset by $13.2 million in gain from the sale of Felix and $8.4 million of deferred income taxes. The deferred income tax benefit primarily\nrelates to amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by the utilization of net operating losses. The decrease from changes in working capital consists primarily of an increase in accounts receivable of $47.7 million and an increase in other assets of $13.0 million. The increase in accounts receivable is primarily due to revenue growth in North America. The increase in other assets is due to increases in capitalized sales commissions and prepaid marketing.\nNet cash used in investing activities includes capital expenditures of $47.0 million, primarily related to investments in the development of capitalized software to support the Company's products and services, leasehold improvements and computer hardware, and purchases (net of maturities) of marketable debt securities of $24.7 million, partially offset by $10.4 million in net proceeds from the sale of Angie's List's campus located in Indianapolis and $3.7 million in cash from the acquisition of Handy, net of cash consideration paid.\nNet cash used in financing activities includes $29.8 million for the payment of withholding taxes on behalf of employees for stock-based awards that were net settled, $13.8 million in principal payments on the Term Loan and $6.1 million for the purchase of noncontrolling interests, partially offset by $4.7 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\nAdjustments to earnings consist primarily of $149.2 million of stock-based compensation expense, $27.5 million of bad debt expense, $23.3 million of amortization of intangibles and $14.5 million of depreciation, partially offset by $48.4 million of deferred income taxes. The deferred income tax benefit primarily relates to the modification charge for the conversion and acceleration of stock-based awards related to the Combination, the net operating loss created by the exercise of HomeAdvisor stock-based awards and the one-time charges related to the Combination. The decrease from changes in working capital consists primarily of an increase in accounts receivable of $33.2 million, partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue of $11.0 million. The increase in accounts receivable is primarily due to revenue growth in North America. The increase in deferred revenue is due to growth in subscription sales and time-based advertising to service professionals.\nNet cash used in investing activities includes $66.3 million of cash used for the acquisitions of MyBuilder, Angie's List, and HomeStars, and capital expenditures of $26.8 million, primarily related to investments in the development of capitalized software to support our products and services and computer hardware. The cash used for the acquisition of Angie's List includes $61.5 million that the Company loaned to Angie's List to fund the repayment of Angie's List debt outstanding immediately prior to the Combination.\nNet cash provided by financing activities includes proceeds from borrowings under the Term Loan of $275.0 million, proceeds from borrowings of related party debt of $131.4 million, including $61.5 million in borrowings from IAC used by the Company to fund the repayment of Angie's List debt immediately prior to the Combination, and cash transfers of $24.2 million from IAC pursuant to IAC's centrally managed U.S. treasury management function, partially offset by principal payments on related party debt of $181.6 million, the purchase of noncontrolling interests of $12.8 million and $10.1 million for the payment of withholding taxes on behalf of employees for stock-based awards that were net settled. The principal payments on related party debt include repayment of $61.5 million in borrowings from IAC used by the Company to fund the repayment of Angie's List debt immediately prior to the Combination.\nAdjustments to earnings consist primarily of $17.4 million of bad debt expense, $8.9 million of stock-based compensation expense, $8.4 million of depreciation and $3.2 million of amortization of intangibles, partially offset by $3.7 million of deferred income taxes. The deferred income tax benefit primarily relates to stock-based compensation expense. The increase from changes in working capital consists primarily of an increase in accounts payable and other liabilities of $14.9 million, an increase in income taxes payable and receivable of $6.9 million and an increase in deferred revenue of $6.9 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $23.9 million and an increase in other assets of $3.0 million. The increase in accounts payable and other liabilities is due to the timing of payments and an increase in employee-related accruals. The increase in income taxes payable and receivable is due to current year income tax accruals in excess of current year income tax payments. The increase in deferred revenue is primarily due to the growth in subscription sales to service professionals. The increase in accounts receivable is primarily due to revenue growth in North America. The increase in other assets is due to an increase in prepaid marketing.\nNet cash used in investing activities includes $15.6 million of cash used for the acquisition of MyHammer and capital expenditures of $16.7 million, primarily related to a new sales center and investments in the development of capitalized software to support our products and services.\nNet cash provided by financing activities includes $44.8 million in proceeds from borrowings of related party debt principally used to fund the acquisition of MyHammer, partially offset by the refinancing of an $11.4 million promissory note, and cash transfers of $4.3 million to IAC pursuant to IAC's centrally managed U.S. treasury management function.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIn periods prior to the Combination, the Company received funding from IAC, including loans from certain IAC foreign subsidiaries, the proceeds of which were primarily used to fund acquisitions.\nAll outstanding long-term debt-related party amounts due between certain IAC subsidiaries and the HomeAdvisor business were settled prior to the completion of the Combination, with the exception of a promissory note payable to a foreign subsidiary of IAC, the principal amount of which at December 31, 2018 was \u20ac0.9 million ($1.0 million).\nOn November 1, 2017, the Company borrowed $275 million under a five-year term loan facility (\"Term Loan\"). On November 5, 2018, the Term Loan was amended and restated, and is now due on November 5, 2023. Interest payments are due at least quarterly through the term of the loan and quarterly principal payments of 1.25% of the original principal amount in the first three years from the amendment date, 2.50% in the fourth year and 3.75% in the fifth year are required. At December 31, 2018, the Term Loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.50%, or 3.98%, which is subject to change in future periods based on the Company's consolidated net leverage ratio.\nOn November 5, 2018, the Company entered into a five-year $250 million revolving credit facility (the \"Credit Facility\"). The annual commitment fee on undrawn funds is currently 25 basis points and is based on the consolidated net leverage ratio most recently reported. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at the Company's option, at either a base rate or LIBOR, in each case plus an applicable margin, which is determined by reference to a pricing grid based on the Company's consolidated net leverage ratio. At December 31, 2018, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility.\nBoth the Term Loan and Credit Facility borrowings are guaranteed by the Company's wholly-owned material domestic subsidiaries and are secured by substantially all assets of the Company and the guarantors, subject to certain exceptions. The terms of the Credit Facility and the Term Loan require ANGI to maintain a consolidated net leverage ratio of not more than 4.5 to 1.0 and a minimum interest coverage ratio of not less than 2.0 to 1.0. There are additional covenants under both the Term Loan and the Credit Facility that limit the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur indebtedness, pay dividends or make distributions.\nOn February 6, 2019, the Board of Directors of ANGI Homeservices authorized the Company to repurchase up to 15 million shares of its common stock.\nIn connection with the Combination, previously issued stock appreciation rights related to the common stock of HomeAdvisor (US) were converted into ANGI stock appreciation rights that are settleable, at the Company's option, on a net basis with ANGI remitting withholding taxes on behalf of the employee or on a gross basis with the Company issuing a sufficient number of Class A shares to cover the withholding taxes. In addition, at IAC's option, these awards can be settled in either Class A shares of ANGI or shares of IAC common stock. If settled in IAC common stock, ANGI reimburses IAC in either cash or through the issuance of Class A shares to IAC. Assuming all of the stock appreciation rights outstanding on February 1, 2019 were net settled on that date, ANGI would have issued 13.0 million Class A shares (either to IAC as reimbursement or to award holders) and ANGI would have remitted $219.6 million in cash for withholding taxes (assuming a 50% withholding rate). If the Company decided to issue a sufficient number of shares to cover the $219.6 million employee withholding tax obligation, 13.0 million additional Class A shares would be issued by ANGI. The Company's cash withholding obligation on all other ANGI net settled awards outstanding on February 1, 2019 is $38.5 million (assuming a 50% withholding rate), which is the equivalent of 2.3 million shares.\nIn addition, prior to the Combination in 2017, IAC issued a number of IAC denominated PSUs to certain ANGI employees. Vesting of the PSUs is contingent upon ANGI's performance. Assuming all of the PSUs outstanding on February 1, 2019 were net settled on that date, ANGI would have issued 0.7 million Class A shares (either to IAC as reimbursement or to award holders) and ANGI would have remitted $12.0 million in cash for withholding taxes (assuming a 50% withholding rate).\nThe Company believes its existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, available borrowings under the Credit Facility and expected positive cash flows generated from operations will be sufficient to fund its normal operating requirements, including capital expenditures, debt service, the payment of withholding taxes on behalf of employees for any stock-based awards that may be net settled, and investing and other commitments, for the foreseeable future. The Company's\n2019 capital expenditures are expected to be higher than 2018 by approximately 30% to 35%, driven, in part, by higher capital expenditures related to the development of capitalized software to support the Company's products and services. The Company's liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for its products and services.\nThe Company's indebtedness could limit its ability to: (i) obtain additional financing to fund working capital needs, acquisitions, capital expenditures or debt service or other requirements; and (ii) use operating cash flow to make certain acquisitions or investments, in the event a default has occurred or, in certain circumstances, if its leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility and Term Loan) exceeds the ratios set forth in the Term Loan. There were no such limitations at December 31, 2018.\nAt December 31, 2018, IAC held all Class B shares of ANGI which represent 83.9% of the economic interest and 98.1% of the voting interest of ANGI. As a result, IAC has the ability to control ANGI's financing activities, including the issuance of additional debt and equity securities by ANGI or any of its subsidiaries, or the incurrence of other indebtedness generally. While ANGI is expected to have the ability to access debt and equity markets if needed, such transactions may require the approval of IAC due to its control of the majority of the outstanding voting power of ANGI's capital stock and its representation on the ANGI board of directors. Additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to the Company or at all.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 to 3\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 to 5\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>236,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>310,147\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt-related party(c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases(d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,371\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75,703\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>171,077\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations(e)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>91,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>274,846\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75,703\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>485,414\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________________________________________\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>The Company has excluded $1.9 million in unrecognized tax benefits from the table above as we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which these liabilities might be paid.

Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" in regard to significant areas of judgment. Management of the Company is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions during the preparation of its consolidated and combined financial statements in accordance with GAAP. These estimates, judgments and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated and combined financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Because of the size of the financial statement elements to which they relate, some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on our consolidated and combined financial statements than others. What follows is a discussion of some of our more significant accounting policies and estimates.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts and Revenue Reserves\nThe Company makes judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables and provides allowances when it has determined that all or a portion of the receivable will not be collected. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide for the estimated amount of accounts receivable that will not be collected. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon a number of factors, including the length of time accounts receivable are past due, the Company's previous loss history and the specific customer's ability to pay its obligation to the Company. The term between the Company issuance of an invoice and payment due date is not significant. The Company also maintains allowances to reserve for potential credits issued to service professionals or other revenue adjustments. The amounts of these reserves are based primarily upon historical experience. The carrying value of the allowance for doubtful accounts and revenue reserves is $16.6 million and $9.3 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Bad debt expense was $47.2 million, $27.5 million and $17.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nBusiness Combinations\nAcquisitions are an important part of the Company's growth strategy. The Company invested $167.8 million (including the value of ANGI Homeservices Class A common stock issued in connection with the acquisition of Handy), $819.0 million (including the value of ANGI Homeservices Class A common stock issued in connection with the Combination) and $19.7 million in acquisitions for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The purchase price of each acquisition is attributed to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition, including identifiable intangible assets that either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill. The fair value of these intangible assets is based on valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management. The excess purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets is recorded as goodwill and is assigned to the reporting unit(s) that is expected to benefit from the combination as of the acquisition date.\nRecoverability of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nGoodwill is the Company's largest asset with a carrying value of $894.7 million and $770.2 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which consist of the Company's acquired trade names and trademarks, have a carrying value of $171.5 million and $153.4 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed annually for impairment as of October 1, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value. In performing its annual assessment, the Company has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value.\nFor the Company's annual goodwill test at October 1, 2018, a qualitative assessment of the North America and Europe reporting units' goodwill was performed because the Company concluded it was more likely than not that the fair value of these reporting units was in excess of their respective carrying values. In the aggregate, ANGI Homeservices' October 1, 2018 market capitalization of $10.7 billion exceeded its carrying value by approximately $9.6 billion. The primary factor that the Company considered in its qualitative assessment for its Europe reporting unit were valuations performed during 2018 that indicated fair value in excess of the carrying value. The fair value of the valuation that was most proximate to, but not as of, October 1, 2018 exceeded the carrying value of the Europe reporting unit by $102.7 million. The primary factors that the Company considered in its qualitative assessment for its North America reporting unit were the strong operating performance of the North America reporting unit and the significant excess of the estimated fair value of the North America reporting unit over\nits carrying value. The fair value of the North America reporting unit was estimated by subtracting the fair value of the Europe reporting unit, from the valuation described above, from the October 1, 2018 market capitalization of the Company; the estimated fair value of the North America reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately $9.5 billion.\nThe annual quantitative test of the recovery of goodwill involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the Company reporting unit that is being tested to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment equal to the excess is recorded.\nThe fair value of the Company's Europe reporting unit is determined using both an income approach based on discounted cash flows (\"DCF\") and a market approach when it tests goodwill for impairment, either on an interim basis or annual basis as of October 1 each year. Determining fair value using a DCF analysis requires the exercise of significant judgment with respect to several items, including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates. The expected cash flows used in the DCF analyses are based on the Company's most recent forecast and budget and, for years beyond the budget, the Company's estimates, which are based, in part, on forecasted growth rates. The discount rates used in the DCF analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows of the respective reporting units. Assumptions used in the DCF analyses, including the discount rate, are assessed based on the reporting units' current results and forecasted future performance, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors. The discount rate used in determining the fair value of the Company's Europe reporting unit was 15.0% in 2018. Determining fair value using a market approach considers multiples of financial metrics based on both acquisitions and trading multiples of a selected peer group of companies. From the comparable companies, a representative market multiple is determined which is applied to financial metrics to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. To determine a peer group of companies for our respective reporting units, we considered companies relevant in terms of consumer use, monetization model, margin and growth characteristics, and brand strength operating in their respective sectors. While a primary driver in the determination of the fair values of the Company's reporting units is the estimate of future revenue and profitability, the determination of fair value is based, in part, upon the Company's assessment of macroeconomic factors, industry and competitive dynamics and the strategies of its businesses in response to these factors.\nWhile the Company has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of its indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than their carrying values, the Company's policy is to determine the fair value of each of its indefinite-lived intangible assets annually as of October 1. The Company determines the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets using an avoided royalty DCF valuation analysis. Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the selection of appropriate royalty and discount rates and estimating the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. The discount rates used in the DCF analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets. The royalty rates used in the DCF analyses are based upon an estimate of the royalty rates that a market participant would pay to license the Company's trade names and trademarks. Assumptions used in the avoided royalty DCF analyses, including the discount rate and royalty rate, are assessed annually based on the actual and projected cash flows related to the asset, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors. The discount rate used in the Company's annual indefinite-lived impairment assessment ranged from 11.5% to 27.5% in 2018 and 11.5% to 18.5% in 2017, and the royalty rate used ranged from 1.5% to 5.5% in 2018 and 1.0% to 6.0% in 2017.\nThe 2018, 2017 and 2016 annual assessments of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets identified no impairments.\nRecoverability and Estimated Useful Lives of Long-Lived Assets\nWe review the carrying value of all long-lived assets, comprising property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If the carrying value is deemed not to be recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. In addition, the Company reviews the useful lives of its long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these lives may be changed. The carrying value of property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets is $203.7 million and $228.4 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company is included within IAC's tax group for purposes of federal and consolidated state income tax return filings. In all periods presented, current and deferred income tax benefit and provision have been computed for the Company on an as if standalone, separate return basis. The Company's payments to IAC for its share of IAC's consolidated federal and state tax\nreturn liabilities have been reflected within cash flows from operating activities in the accompanying consolidated and combined statement of cash flows. The tax sharing agreement between the Company and IAC governs the parties' respective rights, responsibilities and obligations with respect to tax matters, including responsibility for taxes attributable to the Company, entitlement to refunds, allocation of tax attributes and other matters. Any differences between taxes currently due or receivable under the tax sharing agreement and the current tax provision computed on an as if standalone, separate return basis for GAAP are payable to or receivable from IAC and are reflected as adjustments to additional paid-in capital. The portion of the December 31, 2018 deferred tax assets that will be payable to IAC pursuant to the tax sharing agreement, upon realization, is $54.7 million.\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method, and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is provided if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the balance of the Company's net deferred tax asset is $37.0 million and $45.1 million, respectively.\nThe Company evaluates and accounts for uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. Recognition (step one) occurs when the Company concludes that a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is more-likely-than-not to be sustainable upon examination. Measurement (step two) determines the amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. De-recognition of a tax position that was previously recognized would occur when the Company subsequently determines that a tax position no longer meets the more-likely-than-not threshold of being sustained. This measurement step is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we have unrecognized tax benefits of $2.4 million and $1.5 million, respectively. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustment and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. Although management currently believes changes to reserves from period to period and differences between amounts paid, if any, upon resolution of issues raised in audits and amounts previously provided will not have a material impact on liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of the Company, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management's view of these matters may change in the future.\nThe ultimate amount of deferred income tax assets realized and the amounts paid for deferred income tax liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits may vary from our estimates due to future changes in income tax law, state income tax apportionment or the outcome of any review of our tax returns by the various tax authorities, as well as actual operating results of the Company that vary significantly from anticipated results.\nThe Company regularly assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets considering all available evidence including, to the extent applicable, the nature, frequency and severity of prior cumulative losses, forecasts of future taxable income, tax filing status, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, available tax planning and historical experience. As of December 31, 2018, the Company is in a three-year cumulative loss position because of costs incurred in connection with the Combination. The Company's most significant net deferred tax asset relates to U.S. federal net operating loss (\"NOL\") carryforwards of $58.1 million. Based upon current forecasts of future profits, the Company does not expect to be in a three-year cumulative loss position as of December 31, 2019. The Company expects to generate future taxable income of at least $276.7 million prior to the expiration of these NOLs between 2027 and 2037 to fully realize this deferred tax asset.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense reflected in our consolidated and combined statement of operations consists of expense related to the Company's stock appreciation rights, stock options and RSUs, equity instruments denominated in shares of subsidiaries, and IAC denominated stock options and PSUs held by ANGI Homeservices employees.\nThe Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $97.1 million, $149.2 million and $8.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Included in stock-based compensation expense in 2018 and 2017 is $70.6 million and $122.1 million, respectively, related to the modification of previously issued HomeAdvisor equity awards and previously issued Angie's List equity awards, both of which were converted into ANGI Homeservices' equity awards in the Combination, and the acceleration of certain converted equity awards resulting from the termination of Angie's List employees in connection with the Combination. The Company estimates the fair value of stock appreciation rights (including those modified in connection with the Combination) and stock options, including equity instruments denominated in shares of subsidiaries, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions, the most significant of which include expected term, expected volatility of the underlying\nshares, risk-free interest rates and the expected dividend yield. In addition, the recognition of stock-based compensation expense is impacted by our estimated forfeiture rates, which are based, in part, on historical forfeiture rates. For stock appreciation rights and stock options, including equity instruments denominated in shares of subsidiaries, the grant date fair value of the award is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period of the award. The impact on stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2018, assuming a 1% increase in the risk-free interest rate, a 10% increase in the volatility factor and a one-year increase in the weighted average expected term of the outstanding awards would be an increase of $1.3 million, $3.0 million and $1.3 million, respectively. For RSUs, the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of the underlying ANGI Homeservices common stock and expensed as stock-based compensation expense over the vesting term.\nPrior to the Combination, the majority of stock-based compensation expense is related to HomeAdvisor (US) denominated stock appreciation rights and the common stock of certain other entities comprising the HomeAdvisor business. These awards were settleable in shares of IAC common stock having a value equal to the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value of the common stock of the relevant entity of the HomeAdvisor business. Upon completion of the Combination, the stock appreciation rights that related to the common stock of HomeAdvisor (US) were converted into awards that are settleable in Class A shares of our common stock, or in shares of IAC common stock at IAC's election. The equity awards that are denominated in the shares of certain subsidiaries comprising the HomeAdvisor business are also settleable in Class A shares of our common stock, or in shares of IAC common stock at IAC's election. To the extent shares of IAC common stock are issued in settlement of these awards, the Company will reimburse IAC for the cost of those shares by issuing additional Class A shares of its common stock to IAC. For IAC equity awards held by employees of ANGI Homeservices, the Company will reimburse IAC for the cost of those shares by issuing to IAC, at IAC's election, either cash or additional Class B shares of its common stock.\nMarketable Debt Securities\nThe Company invests in marketable debt securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity to fund current operations or satisfy other cash requirements as needed. Marketable debt securities are adjusted to fair value each quarter, and the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of shareholders' equity. The specific-identification method is used to determine the cost of debt securities sold and the amount of unrealized gains and losses reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings. We review our debt securities for impairment each reporting period. The Company recognizes an unrealized loss on debt securities in net earnings when the impairment is determined to be other-than-temporary. Factors we consider in making such determination include the duration, severity and reason for the decline in value and the potential recovery and our intent to sell the debt security. We also consider whether we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis and whether the amortized cost basis cannot be recovered because of credit losses. If an impairment is considered to be other-than-temporary, the debt security will be written down to its fair value and the loss will be recognized within other income (expense), net. The carrying value of marketable debt securities at December 31, 2018, is $24.9 million and consist of treasury discount notes.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see \"Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to the consolidated and combined financial statements included in \"Item 8. Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nMANAGEMENT OVERVIEW\nANGI Homeservices Inc. (\"ANGI Homeservices,\" the \"Company,\" \"ANGI,\" \"we,\" \"our,\" or \"us\") connects millions of homeowners to home service professionals through its portfolio of digital home service brands, including HomeAdvisor\u00ae, Angie's List\u00ae and Handy. Combined, these leading marketplaces have collected more than 15 million reviews over the course of 20 years, allowing homeowners to research, match and connect on-demand to the largest network of service professionals online, through our mobile apps, or by voice assistants. ANGI Homeservices owns and operates brands in eight countries.\nThe HomeAdvisor digital marketplace service connects consumers with service professionals nationwide for home repair, maintenance and improvement projects. HomeAdvisor provides consumers with tools and resources to help them find local, pre-screened and customer-rated service professionals, as well as instantly book appointments with those professionals online or connect with them by telephone. Effective September 29, 2017, the Company also owns and operates Angie's List, Inc. (\"Angie's List\"), which connects consumers with service professionals for local services through a nationwide online directory of service professionals in over 700 service categories and provides consumers with valuable tools, services and content, including verified reviews, to help them research, shop and hire for local services. On October 19, 2018, the Company acquired Handy Technologies, Inc. (\"Handy\"), a leading platform in the United States for connecting individuals looking for household services (primarily cleaning and handyman services) with top-quality, pre-screened independent service professionals. We refer to the HomeAdvisor and Handy businesses in the United States as the (\"Marketplace\"). We also own and operate mHelpDesk and CraftJack. Prior to its sale on December 31, 2018, we also operated Felix.\nThe Company has two operating segments: (i) North America (United States and Canada), which includes HomeAdvisor, Angie's List, Handy, mHelpDesk and HomeStars, and (ii) Europe, which includes Travaux, MyHammer, MyBuilder, Werkspot and Instapro.\nThe Company markets its services to consumers through search engine marketing, television advertising and affiliate agreements with third parties. Pursuant to these affiliate agreements, third parties agree to advertise and promote Marketplace products and services and those of Marketplace service professionals on their platforms. In exchange for these efforts, the Company generally pays these third parties a fixed fee when visitors from their platforms click through to one of our platforms and submit a valid service request through the Marketplace, or when visitors submit a valid service request on the affiliate platform and the affiliate transmits the service request to the Marketplace. The Company also markets its services to consumers through email, digital display advertisements, partnerships with other contextually related websites and, to a lesser extent, through relationships with certain retailers, direct mail and radio advertising. The Company markets subscription packages and time-based advertising to service professionals primarily through its sales force, as well as through search engine marketing, digital media advertising and direct relationships with trade associations and manufacturers. We have made, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in digital and traditional advertising (with continued expansion into new and existing digital platforms) to consumers and service professionals to promote our products and services and to drive traffic to our various platforms and service professionals.\nOperating Metrics:\nIn connection with the management of our businesses, we identify, measure and assess a variety of operating metrics. The principal metrics we use in managing our businesses are set forth below:\n \u2022 Marketplace Revenue includes revenue from the HomeAdvisor and Handy domestic marketplace service, including consumer connection revenue for consumer matches, membership subscription revenue from HomeAdvisor service professionals and revenue from completed jobs sourced through the Handy platform. It excludes revenue from Angie's List, mHelpDesk, HomeStars and Felix. \n \u2022 Advertising & Other Revenue includes Angie's List revenue (revenue from service professionals under contract for advertising and membership subscription fees from consumers) as well as revenue from mHelpDesk, HomeStars and Felix. \n \u2022 Marketplace Service Requests are fully completed and submitted domestic customer service requests to HomeAdvisor and completed jobs sourced through the Handy platform. \n \u2022 Marketplace Paying Service Professionals (\"Marketplace Paying SPs\") are the number of HomeAdvisor and Handy domestic service professionals that had an active subscription and/or paid for consumer matches or completed \na job sourced through the Handy platform in the last month of the period. An active HomeAdvisor subscription is a subscription for which HomeAdvisor was recognizing revenue on the last day of the relevant period.\n \u2022 Advertising Service Professionals are the total number of Angie's List service professionals under contract for advertising at the end of the period.  Components of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nMarketplace Revenue is primarily derived from (i) consumer connection revenue, which comprises fees paid by HomeAdvisor service professionals for consumer matches (regardless of whether the service professional ultimately provides the requested service) and booking fees from completed jobs sourced through the Handy platform, and (ii) membership subscription fees paid by HomeAdvisor service professionals. Consumer connection revenue varies based upon several factors, including the service requested, product experience offered and geographic location of service. Effective with the Combination (described below), Advertising & Other Revenue is primarily derived from Angie's List (i) sales of time-based website, mobile and call center advertising to service professionals and (ii) membership subscription fees from consumers.\nOperating Costs and Expenses:\n \u2022 Cost of revenue - consists primarily of traffic acquisition costs, credit card processing fees, costs associated with publishing and distributing the Angie's List Magazine and hosting fees. Traffic acquisition costs include amounts based on revenue share arrangements. \n \u2022 Selling and marketing expense - consists primarily of advertising expenditures, which include online marketing, including fees paid to search engines, offline marketing, which is primarily television advertising, and partner-related payments to those who direct traffic to our brands, compensation expense (including stock-based compensation expense) and other employee-related costs for our sales force and marketing personnel, and facilities costs. \n \u2022 General and administrative expense - consists primarily of compensation expense (including stock-based compensation expense) and other employee-related costs for personnel engaged in executive management, finance, legal, tax, human resources and customer service functions, fees for professional services (including transaction-related costs related to acquisitions and the Combination), bad debt expense, software license and maintenance costs and facilities costs. Our customer service function includes personnel who provide support to our service professionals and consumers. \n \u2022 Product development expense - consists primarily of compensation expense (including stock-based compensation expense) and other employee-related costs that are not capitalized for personnel engaged in the design, development, testing and enhancement of product offerings and related technology, software license and maintenance costs and facilities costs.  Non-GAAP financial measure\nAdjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (\"Adjusted EBITDA\") is a non-GAAP financial measure. See \"Principles of Financial Reporting\" for the definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net earnings (loss) attributable to ANGI Homeservices Inc. shareholders to operating income (loss) to consolidated and combined Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016.\nThe Combination\nOn September 29, 2017, IAC/InterActiveCorp's (\"IAC\") HomeAdvisor business and Angie's List combined under a new publicly traded company called ANGI Homeservices Inc. (the \"Combination\"). At December 31, 2018, IAC owned 83.9% and 98.1% of the economic and voting interest, respectively, of ANGI Homeservices.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company incurred $3.6 million and $44.1 million, respectively, in costs related to this transaction (including severance, retention, transaction and integration related costs). In addition, the Company had deferred revenue write-offs of $5.5 million and $7.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe Company also incurred $70.6 million and $122.1 million in stock-based compensation expense during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, related to the modification of previously issued HomeAdvisor equity awards and previously issued Angie's List equity awards, both of which were converted into ANGI Homeservices' equity awards in the Combination, and the acceleration of certain converted equity awards resulting from the termination of Angie's List employees in connection with the Combination. Stock-based compensation expense arising from the Combination is expected to be approximately $35 million in 2019 and $20 million in 2020.\n2018 Developments\nOn December 31, 2018, ANGI sold Felix, which was included in our North America segment.\nOn November 5, 2018, ANGI entered into a five-year $250 million revolving credit facility (the \"Credit Facility\") and the term loan facility (the \"Term Loan\") was amended and restated, and is now due on November 5, 2023.\nOn October 19, 2018, ANGI acquired Handy, which is included in our North America segment.\n2018 Consolidated Results\nIn 2018, the Company delivered $395.9 million, or 54%, revenue growth, which was primarily driven by Marketplace Revenue growth of $193.1 million, or 33%; the contribution from Angie's List; and growth in Europe of $12.6 million, or 22%. Operating income increased $211.8 million to $63.9 million from a loss of $147.9 million in the prior year due primarily to an increase in Adjusted EBITDA of $208.3 million, or 532%, and a decrease of $52.2 million in stock-based compensation expense due primarily to a decrease in the modification and acceleration charges of $51.4 million related to the Combination, partially offset by increases of $39.0 million in amortization of intangibles principally due to the Combination and $9.8 million in depreciation. Adjusted EBITDA increased primarily due to the increase in revenue of $395.9 million, a decrease of $40.5 million in costs related to the Combination (including severance, retention, transaction and integration related costs) and lower selling and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue, partially offset by higher compensation expense due, in part, to increased headcount following the Combination, increases of $21.7 million in cost of revenue, $19.7 million in bad debt expense, $15.2 million in software license and maintenance costs and $9.4 million in facilities costs. Operating income and Adjusted EBITDA in 2018 benefited from a reduction in sales commissions expense of $4.9 million due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers on January 1, 2018. As a result of the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09, certain sales commissions, which represent the incremental direct costs of obtaining a service professional contract, are now capitalized and amortized over the estimated life of a service professional; these costs were expensed as incurred prior to January 1, 2018.\nIn addition to the Combination, other events affecting year-over-year comparability that occurred prior to 2018 include the acquisitions of controlling interests in MyBuilder Limited (\"MyBuilder\") on March 24, 2017 (reflected in the Europe segment) and HomeStars Inc. (\"HomeStars\") on February 8, 2017 (reflected in the North America segment).\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016\nRevenue\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td>

million, or 33%, and Advertising & Other Revenue of $190.2 million, or 195%. The increase in Marketplace Revenue is due to an increase in consumer connection revenue of $182.9 million, or 35%, which was driven by a 30% increase in Marketplace Service Requests to 23.5 million and an increase in membership subscription revenue of $10.1 million, or 18%, due to a 18% increase in Marketplace Paying SPs to 214,000. The increase in Advertising & Other Revenue was driven by the contribution from Angie's List, which reflects the write-off of deferred revenue due to the Combination of $5.5 million in 2018 compared to $7.8 million in 2017.\nEurope revenue grew $12.6 million, or 22%, driven by the acquisition of a controlling interest in MyBuilder on March 24, 2017, as well as growth across other regions. Europe revenue also benefited from the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to the Euro.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nNorth America revenue increased $217.1 million, or 47%, due to increases in Marketplace Revenue of $152.5 million, or 36%, and Advertising & Other Revenue of $64.5 million, or 196%. The increase in Marketplace Revenue is due to an increase in consumer connection revenue of $139.0 million, or 36%, which was driven by a 37% increase in Marketplace Service\nRequests to 18.1 million and an increase in membership subscription revenue of $12.6 million, or 29%, due to a 26% increase in Marketplace Paying SPs to 181,000. Advertising & Other Revenue in 2017 includes Angie's List since the date of the Combination, which reflects the write-off of deferred revenue due to the Combination of $7.8 million.\nEurope revenue grew $20.4 million, or 55%, driven by the acquisitions of controlling interests in MyHammer on November 3, 2016 and MyBuilder, as well as organic growth across other regions.\nCost of revenue\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation shown separately below)\n</td> <td>$55,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$21,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$34,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$8,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$25,858\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017\nNorth America cost of revenue increased $21.5 million, or 66%, driven by increases of $7.2 million in traffic acquisition costs, $6.9 million in credit card processing fees due to $3.5 million from the inclusion of Angie's List and higher Marketplace Revenue, $3.7 million in costs associated with publishing and distributing the Angie's List Magazine and $2.6 million in hosting fees, principally from the inclusion of Angie's List.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nNorth America cost of revenue increased $7.2 million, or 28%, driven by increases of $4.2 million in credit card processing fees due to higher Marketplace Revenue and $1.4 million from the inclusion of Angie's List, and $2.1 million in hosting fees, of which $1.3 million was from the inclusion of Angie's List, partially offset by a reduction in traffic acquisition costs of $0.4 million.\nEurope cost of revenue increased $1.0 million, or 383%, driven by an increase of $0.9 million in hosting fees.\nSelling and marketing expense\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling and marketing expense\n</td> <td>$541,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$77,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$464,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$157,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$306,713\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>48%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017\nNorth America selling and marketing expense increased $73.5 million, or 17%, but declined as a percentage of revenue. The increase in North America selling and marketing expense was driven by increases in advertising expense of $53.0 million, reflecting the impact from the inclusion of Angie's List, compensation expense of $11.8 million and facilities costs of $4.0 million. The increase in advertising expense is due primarily to increased investments in online marketing and television spend. Compensation expense increased due primarily to growth in the sales force, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense of $22.4 million and the inclusion of $7.4 million in severance and retention costs in 2017 related to the Combination. The decrease in stock-based compensation expense reflects decreases of $13.3 million in expense due to the modification of previously issued HomeAdvisor equity awards, which were converted into ANGI Homeservices' equity awards ($1.6 million in 2018 compared to $14.8 million in 2017), and $9.0 million in expense related to previously issued Angie's List equity awards, including the acceleration of certain converted equity awards resulting from the termination of Angie's List employees in connection with the Combination ($0.6 million in 2018 compared to $9.6 million in 2017). Compensation expense in 2018 also reflects a reduction in sales commissions expense of $4.9 million due to the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09. As a percentage of revenue, North America selling and marketing expense declined due, in part, to accelerated revenue growth driven by capacity expansion efforts combined with marketing optimization efforts.\nEurope selling and marketing expense increased $4.0 million, or 11%, driven by $3.6 million of increased expense from the inclusion of MyBuilder, principally related to advertising, and increases in compensation expense of $1.0 million and facilities costs of $1.0 million, partially offset by a decrease in advertising expense of $2.5 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nNorth America selling and marketing expense increased $142.8 million, or 50%, driven by an increase in advertising expense of $73.3 million, of which $5.3 million was from the inclusion of Angie's List, an increase of $62.4 million in compensation expense, of which $24.4 million was from the inclusion of Angie's List, as well as $2.5 million of expense from the acquisition of HomeStars. The increase in advertising expense is due primarily to increased organic investments in online marketing and television spend. Compensation expense increased due primarily to an increase of $24.9 million in stock-based compensation expense, of which $9.8 million was from the inclusion of Angie's List, an increase in the sales force and the inclusion of $7.4 million in severance and retention costs related to the Combination. The increase in stock-based compensation expense reflects $14.8 million of expense in 2017 due to the modification of previously issued HomeAdvisor equity awards, which were converted into ANGI Homeservices' equity awards, and $9.6 million of expense in 2017 related to previously issued Angie's List equity awards, including the acceleration of certain converted equity awards resulting from the termination of Angie's List employees in connection with the Combination.\nEurope selling and marketing expense increased $14.5 million, or 65%, driven by organic growth of $4.9 million in advertising expense and $2.5 million in compensation expense due, in part, to an increase in the sales force, as well as $7.0 million of expense from the acquisitions of MyHammer and MyBuilder.\nGeneral and administrative expense\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expense\n</td> <td>$323,462\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$23,029\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$300,433\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$190,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>173%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$110,093\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>29%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017\nNorth America general and administrative expense increased $24.9 million, or 9%, due primarily to an increase of $19.5 million in bad debt expense due, in part, to higher Marketplace Revenue, increases of $9.4 million in software license and maintenance costs and $3.7 million in facilities costs, both reflecting the impact from the inclusion of Angie's List, and an increase in customer service expense of $3.4 million, partially offset by a reduction in transaction and integration-related costs principally related to the Combination of $21.1 million. North America general and administrative expense also includes an increase in compensation expense of $1.0 million. The increase in compensation expense is due primarily to an increase in headcount following the Combination and existing business growth as well as $3.8 million from the inclusion of Handy, almost entirely offset by a decrease of $24.9 million in stock-based compensation expense and a decrease of $9.2 million in severance and retention costs related to the Combination ($2.7 million in 2018 compared to $11.8 million in 2017). The decrease in stock-based compensation expense reflects decreases of $12.9 million in expense due to the modification of previously issued HomeAdvisor equity awards, which were converted into ANGI Homeservices' equity awards ($52.9 million in 2018 compared to $65.7 million in 2017), and $9.6 million in expense related to previously issued Angie's List equity awards, including the acceleration of certain converted equity awards resulting from the termination of Angie's List employees in connection with the Combination ($8.1 million in 2018 compared to $17.7 million in 2017), and the inclusion in 2017 of a modification charge related to a HomeAdvisor equity award, partially offset by acceleration of expense related to certain equity awards in the fourth quarter of 2018 in connection with the chief executive officer transition and the issuance of new equity awards since 2017.\nEurope general and administrative expense decreased $1.9 million, or 7%, due primarily to a reduction in facilities costs and the inclusion in 2017 of $0.8 million of transaction-related costs primarily related to the acquisition of MyBuilder, partially offset by $1.1 million of increased expense from the inclusion of MyBuilder.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nNorth America general and administrative expense increased $181.8 million, or 200%, due primarily to higher compensation expense of $129.4 million, of which $38.4 million was from the inclusion of Angie's List, and $24.3 million in\ncosts related to the Combination including transaction related costs of $14.3 million and integration related costs of $10.0 million. The increase in compensation expense is due principally to an increase of $100.7 million in stock-based compensation expense, of which $18.0 million was from the inclusion of Angie's List, an increase in headcount from business growth and the inclusion of $11.8 million in severance and retention costs in 2017 related to the Combination. The increase in stock-based compensation expense reflects $65.7 million of expense in 2017 due to the modification of previously issued HomeAdvisor equity awards, which were converted into ANGI Homeservices' equity awards, and $17.7 million of expense in 2017 related to previously issued Angie's List equity awards, including the acceleration of certain converted equity awards resulting from the termination of Angie's List employees in connection with the Combination, as well as a modification charge related to a HomeAdvisor equity award in 2017. North America general and administrative expense also includes increases of $9.3 million in bad debt expense due to higher Marketplace Revenue, $3.9 million in customer service expense and $3.1 million in software license and maintenance costs, as well as $2.5 million of expense from the inclusion of HomeStars.\nEurope general and administrative expense increased $8.5 million, or 45%, due primarily to $7.3 million of expense from the inclusion of MyHammer and MyBuilder and an increase of $1.3 million in compensation expense due, in part, to increased headcount.\nProduct development expense\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product development expense\n</td> <td>$61,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$13,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$47,907\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$27,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>133%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$20,596\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017\nNorth America product development expense increased $8.1 million, or 19%, due primarily to an increase in software license and maintenance costs of $3.8 million, reflecting the impact from the inclusion of Angie's List, and an increase in compensation expense of $2.8 million.

The decrease in stock-based compensation expense was due primarily to a decrease of $51.4 million in modification and acceleration charges related to the Combination and the inclusion in 2017 of a modification charge related to a HomeAdvisor equity award, partially offset by acceleration of expense related to certain equity awards in the fourth quarter of 2018 in connection with the chief executive officer transition and the issuance of new equity awards since 2017. The increase in amortization of intangibles was principally due to the Combination.\nEurope operating loss decreased $5.2 million, or 27%, due primarily to a reduction in Adjusted EBITDA loss of $4.6 million described below and decreases of $1.1 million in amortization of intangibles and $0.7 million in stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by an increase of $1.1 million in depreciation.\nAt December 31, 2018, there is $130.0 million of unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to all equity-based awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.0 years.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nNorth America operating income decreased $160.9 million to an operating loss of $128.5 million in 2017 as compared to operating income of $32.5 million in 2016, despite an increase of $0.1 million in Adjusted EBITDA described below, primarily due to an increase of $140.4 million in stock-based compensation expense, an increase of $15.3 million in amortization of intangibles and an increase of $5.2 million in depreciation. The increase in stock-based compensation expense was due primarily to modification and acceleration charges of $122.1 million related to the Combination and the inclusion in 2017 of a modification charge related to a HomeAdvisor equity award. The increase in amortization of intangibles was due principally to the Combination.\nEurope operating loss increased $11.0 million, or 131%, primarily due to an increase in Adjusted EBITDA loss of $5.5 million described below, an increase of $4.8 million in amortization of intangibles and an increase of $0.9 million in depreciation, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense of $0.1 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North America\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>253,963\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>203,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>406%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>94\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe\n</td> <td>(6,457\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,562\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,019\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,477\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(99)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,542\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>247,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>208,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>532%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5,383\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>22%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor a reconciliation of net earnings (loss) attributable to ANGI Homeservices Inc. shareholders to operating income (loss) to consolidated and combined Adjusted EBITDA, see \"Principles of Financial Reporting.\" For a reconciliation of operating income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA for the Company's reportable segments, see \"Note 12-Segment Information\" to the consolidated and combined financial statements included in \"Item 8.

Additionally, Europe Adjusted EBITDA loss in 2017 includes $0.8 million of transaction-related costs primarily related to the acquisition of MyBuilder.\nAdjusted EBITDA in 2018 benefited from a reduction in sales commissions expense of $4.9 million for North America due to the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 on January 1, 2018.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nNorth America Adjusted EBITDA increased $0.1 million, despite the significant increase of $217.1 million in revenue, due primarily to an increase in advertising expense of $73.3 million, higher compensation expense due, in part, to increased headcount, the inclusion in 2017 of $44.1 million in costs related to the Combination (including severance, retention, transaction and integration related costs) and increases of $9.3 million in bad debt expense due to higher revenue, $3.9 million in customer service expense and $3.1 million in software license and maintenance costs. Adjusted EBITDA in 2017 was further impacted by write-offs of deferred revenue related to the Combination of $7.8 million and the acquisition of HomeStars of $0.7 million.\nEurope Adjusted EBITDA loss increased $5.5 million, or 99%, driven primarily by our European expansion strategy including an increase in advertising expense of $10.7 million and higher compensation expense of $10.5 million both due primarily to the inclusion of MyHammer and MyBuilder. The increase in compensation expense was also due to increased organic headcount.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense-third-party relates to interest on the Term Loan, which commenced on November 1, 2017 and commitment fees on the undrawn Credit Facility, which commenced on November 5, 2018.\nInterest expense-related party includes interest charged by IAC and its subsidiaries on related party notes, which were primarily related to acquisitions.

The Tax Act implemented a number of changes that took effect on January 1, 2018, including but not limited to, a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and a new minimum tax on global intangible low-taxed income earned by foreign subsidiaries. The Company was able to make a reasonable estimate of the impacts of the Tax Act in the fourth quarter of 2017 as described below. In the third quarter of 2018, the Company finalized its calculations related to the impacts of the Tax Act with no adjustment in 2018 to the Company's previously recorded provisional tax expense.\nIn 2017, the effective income tax rate is lower than the statutory rate of 35% due primarily to the effect of the Tax Act, largely offset by adopting the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, on January 1, 2017. The Tax Act required a remeasurement of U.S. net deferred tax assets due to the reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, resulting in a tax expense of $33.0 million. The Company was not subject to the one-time transition tax because it has cumulative losses from its international operations. Under ASU No. 2016-09, excess tax benefits generated by the settlement or exercise of stock-based awards of $35.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 are recognized as a reduction to the income tax provision rather than as an increase to additional paid-in capital.\nIn 2016, the effective income tax rate is higher than the statutory rate of 35% due primarily to unbenefited losses in separate jurisdictions and state taxes, partially offset by research credits.\nFor further details of income tax matters, see \"Note 3-Income Taxes\" to the consolidated and combined financial statements included in \"Item 8. Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL REPORTING\nWe report Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). This measure is one of the primary metrics by which we evaluate the performance of our businesses, on which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated. We believe that investors should have access to, and we are obligated to provide, the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results. This non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. We endeavor to compensate for the limitations of the non-GAAP measure presented by providing the comparable GAAP measure with equal or greater prominence and descriptions of the reconciling items, including quantifying such items, to derive the non-GAAP measure. We encourage investors to examine the reconciling adjustments between the GAAP and non-GAAP measure, which we discuss below.\nDefinition of Non-GAAP Measure\nAdjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (\"Adjusted EBITDA\") is defined as operating income excluding: (1) stock-based compensation expense; (2) depreciation; and (3) acquisition-related items consisting of amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets, if applicable. We believe this measure is useful for analysts and investors as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison between our performance and that of our competitors.

These expenses are not paid in cash, and we include the related shares in our fully diluted shares outstanding using the treasury stock method. Performance-based RSUs are included only to the extent the applicable performance condition(s) have been met (assuming the end of the reporting period is the end of the contingency period). To the extent that stock-based awards are settled on a net basis, the Company remits the required tax-withholding amount from its current funds.\nDepreciation is a non-cash expense relating to our property and equipment and is computed using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated useful lives, or, in the case of leasehold improvements, the lease term, if shorter.\nAmortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets are non-cash expenses related primarily to acquisitions (including the Combination). At the time of an acquisition, the identifiable definite-lived intangible assets of the acquired company, such as service professional and contractor relationships, technology, memberships, customer lists and user base, and trade names, are valued and amortized over their estimated lives. Value is also assigned to acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets, which comprise trade names and trademarks, and goodwill that are not subject to amortization. An impairment is recorded when the carrying value of an intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value. We believe that intangible assets represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to acquisition and the related amortization and impairment charges of intangible assets or goodwill, if applicable, are not ongoing costs of doing business.\nFINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nFinancial Position Table 98: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>328,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>214,803\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All other countries (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>336,984\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>221,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Marketable securities (United States)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,947\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>361,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>221,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term Loan due November 5, 2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>261,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>275,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: current portion of Term Loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: unamortized debt issuance costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,529\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total long-term debt, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>244,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>258,312\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt-related party\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,813\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: current portion of long-term debt-related party\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>816\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total long-term debt-related party, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,997\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_________________________________________________________________________\n (a) If needed for U.S. operations, the cash and cash equivalents held by the Company's foreign subsidiaries could be repatriated without significant tax consequences.

Non-cash adjustments include stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangibles, bad debt expense, depreciation, gain from the sale of a business, and deferred income taxes.\nAdjustments to earnings consist primarily of $97.1 million of stock-based compensation expense, $62.2 million of amortization of intangibles, $47.2 million of bad debt expense and $24.3 million of depreciation, partially offset by $13.2 million in gain from the sale of Felix and $8.4 million of deferred income taxes. The deferred income tax benefit primarily\nrelates to amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by the utilization of net operating losses. The decrease from changes in working capital consists primarily of an increase in accounts receivable of $47.7 million and an increase in other assets of $13.0 million. The increase in accounts receivable is primarily due to revenue growth in North America. The increase in other assets is due to increases in capitalized sales commissions and prepaid marketing.\nNet cash used in investing activities includes capital expenditures of $47.0 million, primarily related to investments in the development of capitalized software to support the Company's products and services, leasehold improvements and computer hardware, and purchases (net of maturities) of marketable debt securities of $24.7 million, partially offset by $10.4 million in net proceeds from the sale of Angie's List's campus located in Indianapolis and $3.7 million in cash from the acquisition of Handy, net of cash consideration paid.\nNet cash used in financing activities includes $29.8 million for the payment of withholding taxes on behalf of employees for stock-based awards that were net settled, $13.8 million in principal payments on the Term Loan and $6.1 million for the purchase of noncontrolling interests, partially offset by $4.7 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\nAdjustments to earnings consist primarily of $149.2 million of stock-based compensation expense, $27.5 million of bad debt expense, $23.3 million of amortization of intangibles and $14.5 million of depreciation, partially offset by $48.4 million of deferred income taxes. The deferred income tax benefit primarily relates to the modification charge for the conversion and acceleration of stock-based awards related to the Combination, the net operating loss created by the exercise of HomeAdvisor stock-based awards and the one-time charges related to the Combination. The decrease from changes in working capital consists primarily of an increase in accounts receivable of $33.2 million, partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue of $11.0 million. The increase in accounts receivable is primarily due to revenue growth in North America. The increase in deferred revenue is due to growth in subscription sales and time-based advertising to service professionals.\nNet cash used in investing activities includes $66.3 million of cash used for the acquisitions of MyBuilder, Angie's List, and HomeStars, and capital expenditures of $26.8 million, primarily related to investments in the development of capitalized software to support our products and services and computer hardware. The cash used for the acquisition of Angie's List includes $61.5 million that the Company loaned to Angie's List to fund the repayment of Angie's List debt outstanding immediately prior to the Combination.\nNet cash provided by financing activities includes proceeds from borrowings under the Term Loan of $275.0 million, proceeds from borrowings of related party debt of $131.4 million, including $61.5 million in borrowings from IAC used by the Company to fund the repayment of Angie's List debt immediately prior to the Combination, and cash transfers of $24.2 million from IAC pursuant to IAC's centrally managed U.S. treasury management function, partially offset by principal payments on related party debt of $181.6 million, the purchase of noncontrolling interests of $12.8 million and $10.1 million for the payment of withholding taxes on behalf of employees for stock-based awards that were net settled. The principal payments on related party debt include repayment of $61.5 million in borrowings from IAC used by the Company to fund the repayment of Angie's List debt immediately prior to the Combination.\nAdjustments to earnings consist primarily of $17.4 million of bad debt expense, $8.9 million of stock-based compensation expense, $8.4 million of depreciation and $3.2 million of amortization of intangibles, partially offset by $3.7 million of deferred income taxes. The deferred income tax benefit primarily relates to stock-based compensation expense. The increase from changes in working capital consists primarily of an increase in accounts payable and other liabilities of $14.9 million, an increase in income taxes payable and receivable of $6.9 million and an increase in deferred revenue of $6.9 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $23.9 million and an increase in other assets of $3.0 million. The increase in accounts payable and other liabilities is due to the timing of payments and an increase in employee-related accruals. The increase in income taxes payable and receivable is due to current year income tax accruals in excess of current year income tax payments. The increase in deferred revenue is primarily due to the growth in subscription sales to service professionals. The increase in accounts receivable is primarily due to revenue growth in North America. The increase in other assets is due to an increase in prepaid marketing.\nNet cash used in investing activities includes $15.6 million of cash used for the acquisition of MyHammer and capital expenditures of $16.7 million, primarily related to a new sales center and investments in the development of capitalized software to support our products and services.\nNet cash provided by financing activities includes $44.8 million in proceeds from borrowings of related party debt principally used to fund the acquisition of MyHammer, partially offset by the refinancing of an $11.4 million promissory note, and cash transfers of $4.3 million to IAC pursuant to IAC's centrally managed U.S. treasury management function.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIn periods prior to the Combination, the Company received funding from IAC, including loans from certain IAC foreign subsidiaries, the proceeds of which were primarily used to fund acquisitions.\nAll outstanding long-term debt-related party amounts due between certain IAC subsidiaries and the HomeAdvisor business were settled prior to the completion of the Combination, with the exception of a promissory note payable to a foreign subsidiary of IAC, the principal amount of which at December 31, 2018 was \u20ac0.9 million ($1.0 million).\nOn November 1, 2017, the Company borrowed $275 million under a five-year term loan facility (\"Term Loan\"). On November 5, 2018, the Term Loan was amended and restated, and is now due on November 5, 2023. Interest payments are due at least quarterly through the term of the loan and quarterly principal payments of 1.25% of the original principal amount in the first three years from the amendment date, 2.50% in the fourth year and 3.75% in the fifth year are required. At December 31, 2018, the Term Loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.50%, or 3.98%, which is subject to change in future periods based on the Company's consolidated net leverage ratio.\nOn November 5, 2018, the Company entered into a five-year $250 million revolving credit facility (the \"Credit Facility\"). The annual commitment fee on undrawn funds is currently 25 basis points and is based on the consolidated net leverage ratio most recently reported. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at the Company's option, at either a base rate or LIBOR, in each case plus an applicable margin, which is determined by reference to a pricing grid based on the Company's consolidated net leverage ratio. At December 31, 2018, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility.\nBoth the Term Loan and Credit Facility borrowings are guaranteed by the Company's wholly-owned material domestic subsidiaries and are secured by substantially all assets of the Company and the guarantors, subject to certain exceptions. The terms of the Credit Facility and the Term Loan require ANGI to maintain a consolidated net leverage ratio of not more than 4.5 to 1.0 and a minimum interest coverage ratio of not less than 2.0 to 1.0. There are additional covenants under both the Term Loan and the Credit Facility that limit the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur indebtedness, pay dividends or make distributions.\nOn February 6, 2019, the Board of Directors of ANGI Homeservices authorized the Company to repurchase up to 15 million shares of its common stock.\nIn connection with the Combination, previously issued stock appreciation rights related to the common stock of HomeAdvisor (US) were converted into ANGI stock appreciation rights that are settleable, at the Company's option, on a net basis with ANGI remitting withholding taxes on behalf of the employee or on a gross basis with the Company issuing a sufficient number of Class A shares to cover the withholding taxes. In addition, at IAC's option, these awards can be settled in either Class A shares of ANGI or shares of IAC common stock. If settled in IAC common stock, ANGI reimburses IAC in either cash or through the issuance of Class A shares to IAC. Assuming all of the stock appreciation rights outstanding on February 1, 2019 were net settled on that date, ANGI would have issued 13.0 million Class A shares (either to IAC as reimbursement or to award holders) and ANGI would have remitted $219.6 million in cash for withholding taxes (assuming a 50% withholding rate). If the Company decided to issue a sufficient number of shares to cover the $219.6 million employee withholding tax obligation, 13.0 million additional Class A shares would be issued by ANGI. The Company's cash withholding obligation on all other ANGI net settled awards outstanding on February 1, 2019 is $38.5 million (assuming a 50% withholding rate), which is the equivalent of 2.3 million shares.\nIn addition, prior to the Combination in 2017, IAC issued a number of IAC denominated PSUs to certain ANGI employees. Vesting of the PSUs is contingent upon ANGI's performance. Assuming all of the PSUs outstanding on February 1, 2019 were net settled on that date, ANGI would have issued 0.7 million Class A shares (either to IAC as reimbursement or to award holders) and ANGI would have remitted $12.0 million in cash for withholding taxes (assuming a 50% withholding rate).\nThe Company believes its existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, available borrowings under the Credit Facility and expected positive cash flows generated from operations will be sufficient to fund its normal operating requirements, including capital expenditures, debt service, the payment of withholding taxes on behalf of employees for any stock-based awards that may be net settled, and investing and other commitments, for the foreseeable future. The Company's\n2019 capital expenditures are expected to be higher than 2018 by approximately 30% to 35%, driven, in part, by higher capital expenditures related to the development of capitalized software to support the Company's products and services. The Company's liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for its products and services.\nThe Company's indebtedness could limit its ability to: (i) obtain additional financing to fund working capital needs, acquisitions, capital expenditures or debt service or other requirements; and (ii) use operating cash flow to make certain acquisitions or investments, in the event a default has occurred or, in certain circumstances, if its leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility and Term Loan) exceeds the ratios set forth in the Term Loan. There were no such limitations at December 31, 2018.\nAt December 31, 2018, IAC held all Class B shares of ANGI which represent 83.9% of the economic interest and 98.1% of the voting interest of ANGI. As a result, IAC has the ability to control ANGI's financing activities, including the issuance of additional debt and equity securities by ANGI or any of its subsidiaries, or the incurrence of other indebtedness generally. While ANGI is expected to have the ability to access debt and equity markets if needed, such transactions may require the approval of IAC due to its control of the majority of the outstanding voting power of ANGI's capital stock and its representation on the ANGI board of directors. Additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to the Company or at all.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 to 3\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 to 5\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>236,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>310,147\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt-related party(c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases(d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,371\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75,703\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>171,077\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations(e)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>91,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>274,846\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75,703\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>485,414\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________________________________________\n (a) The Company has excluded $1.9 million in unrecognized tax benefits from the table above as we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which these liabilities might be paid.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOther than the items described above, the Company does not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2018.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe following disclosure is provided to supplement the descriptions of ANGI Homeservices' accounting policies contained in \"Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to the consolidated and combined financial statements included \"Item 8. Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" in regard to significant areas of judgment. Management of the Company is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions during the preparation of its consolidated and combined financial statements in accordance with GAAP. These estimates, judgments and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated and combined financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Because of the size of the financial statement elements to which they relate, some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on our consolidated and combined financial statements than others. What follows is a discussion of some of our more significant accounting policies and estimates.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts and Revenue Reserves\nThe Company makes judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables and provides allowances when it has determined that all or a portion of the receivable will not be collected. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide for the estimated amount of accounts receivable that will not be collected. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon a number of factors, including the length of time accounts receivable are past due, the Company's previous loss history and the specific customer's ability to pay its obligation to the Company. The term between the Company issuance of an invoice and payment due date is not significant. The Company also maintains allowances to reserve for potential credits issued to service professionals or other revenue adjustments. The amounts of these reserves are based primarily upon historical experience. The carrying value of the allowance for doubtful accounts and revenue reserves is $16.6 million and $9.3 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Bad debt expense was $47.2 million, $27.5 million and $17.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nBusiness Combinations\nAcquisitions are an important part of the Company's growth strategy. The Company invested $167.8 million (including the value of ANGI Homeservices Class A common stock issued in connection with the acquisition of Handy), $819.0 million (including the value of ANGI Homeservices Class A common stock issued in connection with the Combination) and $19.7 million in acquisitions for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The purchase price of each acquisition is attributed to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition, including identifiable intangible assets that either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill. The fair value of these intangible assets is based on valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management. The excess purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets is recorded as goodwill and is assigned to the reporting unit(s) that is expected to benefit from the combination as of the acquisition date.\nRecoverability of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nGoodwill is the Company's largest asset with a carrying value of $894.7 million and $770.2 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which consist of the Company's acquired trade names and trademarks, have a carrying value of $171.5 million and $153.4 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed annually for impairment as of October 1, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value. In performing its annual assessment, the Company has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value.\nFor the Company's annual goodwill test at October 1, 2018, a qualitative assessment of the North America and Europe reporting units' goodwill was performed because the Company concluded it was more likely than not that the fair value of these reporting units was in excess of their respective carrying values. In the aggregate, ANGI Homeservices' October 1, 2018 market capitalization of $10.7 billion exceeded its carrying value by approximately $9.6 billion. The primary factor that the Company considered in its qualitative assessment for its Europe reporting unit were valuations performed during 2018 that indicated fair value in excess of the carrying value. The fair value of the valuation that was most proximate to, but not as of, October 1, 2018 exceeded the carrying value of the Europe reporting unit by $102.7 million. The primary factors that the Company considered in its qualitative assessment for its North America reporting unit were the strong operating performance of the North America reporting unit and the significant excess of the estimated fair value of the North America reporting unit over\nits carrying value. The fair value of the North America reporting unit was estimated by subtracting the fair value of the Europe reporting unit, from the valuation described above, from the October 1, 2018 market capitalization of the Company; the estimated fair value of the North America reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately $9.5 billion.\nThe annual quantitative test of the recovery of goodwill involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the Company reporting unit that is being tested to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment equal to the excess is recorded.\nThe fair value of the Company's Europe reporting unit is determined using both an income approach based on discounted cash flows (\"DCF\") and a market approach when it tests goodwill for impairment, either on an interim basis or annual basis as of October 1 each year. Determining fair value using a DCF analysis requires the exercise of significant judgment with respect to several items, including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates. The expected cash flows used in the DCF analyses are based on the Company's most recent forecast and budget and, for years beyond the budget, the Company's estimates, which are based, in part, on forecasted growth rates. The discount rates used in the DCF analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows of the respective reporting units. Assumptions used in the DCF analyses, including the discount rate, are assessed based on the reporting units' current results and forecasted future performance, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors. The discount rate used in determining the fair value of the Company's Europe reporting unit was 15.0% in 2018. Determining fair value using a market approach considers multiples of financial metrics based on both acquisitions and trading multiples of a selected peer group of companies. From the comparable companies, a representative market multiple is determined which is applied to financial metrics to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. To determine a peer group of companies for our respective reporting units, we considered companies relevant in terms of consumer use, monetization model, margin and growth characteristics, and brand strength operating in their respective sectors. While a primary driver in the determination of the fair values of the Company's reporting units is the estimate of future revenue and profitability, the determination of fair value is based, in part, upon the Company's assessment of macroeconomic factors, industry and competitive dynamics and the strategies of its businesses in response to these factors.\nWhile the Company has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of its indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than their carrying values, the Company's policy is to determine the fair value of each of its indefinite-lived intangible assets annually as of October 1. The Company determines the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets using an avoided royalty DCF valuation analysis. Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the selection of appropriate royalty and discount rates and estimating the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. The discount rates used in the DCF analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets. The royalty rates used in the DCF analyses are based upon an estimate of the royalty rates that a market participant would pay to license the Company's trade names and trademarks. Assumptions used in the avoided royalty DCF analyses, including the discount rate and royalty rate, are assessed annually based on the actual and projected cash flows related to the asset, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors. The discount rate used in the Company's annual indefinite-lived impairment assessment ranged from 11.5% to 27.5% in 2018 and 11.5% to 18.5% in 2017, and the royalty rate used ranged from 1.5% to 5.5% in 2018 and 1.0% to 6.0% in 2017.\nThe 2018, 2017 and 2016 annual assessments of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets identified no impairments.\nRecoverability and Estimated Useful Lives of Long-Lived Assets\nWe review the carrying value of all long-lived assets, comprising property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If the carrying value is deemed not to be recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. In addition, the Company reviews the useful lives of its long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these lives may be changed. The carrying value of property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets is $203.7 million and $228.4 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company is included within IAC's tax group for purposes of federal and consolidated state income tax return filings. In all periods presented, current and deferred income tax benefit and provision have been computed for the Company on an as if standalone, separate return basis. The Company's payments to IAC for its share of IAC's consolidated federal and state tax\nreturn liabilities have been reflected within cash flows from operating activities in the accompanying consolidated and combined statement of cash flows. The tax sharing agreement between the Company and IAC governs the parties' respective rights, responsibilities and obligations with respect to tax matters, including responsibility for taxes attributable to the Company, entitlement to refunds, allocation of tax attributes and other matters. Any differences between taxes currently due or receivable under the tax sharing agreement and the current tax provision computed on an as if standalone, separate return basis for GAAP are payable to or receivable from IAC and are reflected as adjustments to additional paid-in capital. The portion of the December 31, 2018 deferred tax assets that will be payable to IAC pursuant to the tax sharing agreement, upon realization, is $54.7 million.\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method, and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is provided if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the balance of the Company's net deferred tax asset is $37.0 million and $45.1 million, respectively.\nThe Company evaluates and accounts for uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. Recognition (step one) occurs when the Company concludes that a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is more-likely-than-not to be sustainable upon examination. Measurement (step two) determines the amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. De-recognition of a tax position that was previously recognized would occur when the Company subsequently determines that a tax position no longer meets the more-likely-than-not threshold of being sustained. This measurement step is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we have unrecognized tax benefits of $2.4 million and $1.5 million, respectively. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustment and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. Although management currently believes changes to reserves from period to period and differences between amounts paid, if any, upon resolution of issues raised in audits and amounts previously provided will not have a material impact on liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of the Company, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management's view of these matters may change in the future.\nThe ultimate amount of deferred income tax assets realized and the amounts paid for deferred income tax liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits may vary from our estimates due to future changes in income tax law, state income tax apportionment or the outcome of any review of our tax returns by the various tax authorities, as well as actual operating results of the Company that vary significantly from anticipated results.\nThe Company regularly assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets considering all available evidence including, to the extent applicable, the nature, frequency and severity of prior cumulative losses, forecasts of future taxable income, tax filing status, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, available tax planning and historical experience. As of December 31, 2018, the Company is in a three-year cumulative loss position because of costs incurred in connection with the Combination. The Company's most significant net deferred tax asset relates to U.S. federal net operating loss (\"NOL\") carryforwards of $58.1 million. Based upon current forecasts of future profits, the Company does not expect to be in a three-year cumulative loss position as of December 31, 2019. The Company expects to generate future taxable income of at least $276.7 million prior to the expiration of these NOLs between 2027 and 2037 to fully realize this deferred tax asset.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense reflected in our consolidated and combined statement of operations consists of expense related to the Company's stock appreciation rights, stock options and RSUs, equity instruments denominated in shares of subsidiaries, and IAC denominated stock options and PSUs held by ANGI Homeservices employees.\nThe Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $97.1 million, $149.2 million and $8.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Included in stock-based compensation expense in 2018 and 2017 is $70.6 million and $122.1 million, respectively, related to the modification of previously issued HomeAdvisor equity awards and previously issued Angie's List equity awards, both of which were converted into ANGI Homeservices' equity awards in the Combination, and the acceleration of certain converted equity awards resulting from the termination of Angie's List employees in connection with the Combination. The Company estimates the fair value of stock appreciation rights (including those modified in connection with the Combination) and stock options, including equity instruments denominated in shares of subsidiaries, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions, the most significant of which include expected term, expected volatility of the underlying\nshares, risk-free interest rates and the expected dividend yield. In addition, the recognition of stock-based compensation expense is impacted by our estimated forfeiture rates, which are based, in part, on historical forfeiture rates. For stock appreciation rights and stock options, including equity instruments denominated in shares of subsidiaries, the grant date fair value of the award is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period of the award. The impact on stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2018, assuming a 1% increase in the risk-free interest rate, a 10% increase in the volatility factor and a one-year increase in the weighted average expected term of the outstanding awards would be an increase of $1.3 million, $3.0 million and $1.3 million, respectively. For RSUs, the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of the underlying ANGI Homeservices common stock and expensed as stock-based compensation expense over the vesting term.\nPrior to the Combination, the majority of stock-based compensation expense is related to HomeAdvisor (US) denominated stock appreciation rights and the common stock of certain other entities comprising the HomeAdvisor business. These awards were settleable in shares of IAC common stock having a value equal to the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value of the common stock of the relevant entity of the HomeAdvisor business. Upon completion of the Combination, the stock appreciation rights that related to the common stock of HomeAdvisor (US) were converted into awards that are settleable in Class A shares of our common stock, or in shares of IAC common stock at IAC's election. The equity awards that are denominated in the shares of certain subsidiaries comprising the HomeAdvisor business are also settleable in Class A shares of our common stock, or in shares of IAC common stock at IAC's election. To the extent shares of IAC common stock are issued in settlement of these awards, the Company will reimburse IAC for the cost of those shares by issuing additional Class A shares of its common stock to IAC. For IAC equity awards held by employees of ANGI Homeservices, the Company will reimburse IAC for the cost of those shares by issuing to IAC, at IAC's election, either cash or additional Class B shares of its common stock.\nMarketable Debt Securities\nThe Company invests in marketable debt securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity to fund current operations or satisfy other cash requirements as needed. Marketable debt securities are adjusted to fair value each quarter, and the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of shareholders' equity. The specific-identification method is used to determine the cost of debt securities sold and the amount of unrealized gains and losses reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings. We review our debt securities for impairment each reporting period. The Company recognizes an unrealized loss on debt securities in net earnings when the impairment is determined to be other-than-temporary. Factors we consider in making such determination include the duration, severity and reason for the decline in value and the potential recovery and our intent to sell the debt security. We also consider whether we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis and whether the amortized cost basis cannot be recovered because of credit losses. If an impairment is considered to be other-than-temporary, the debt security will be written down to its fair value and the loss will be recognized within other income (expense), net. The carrying value of marketable debt securities at December 31, 2018, is $24.9 million and consist of treasury discount notes.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see \"Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to the consolidated and combined financial statements included in \"Item 8. Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nMANAGEMENT OVERVIEW\nANGI Homeservices Inc. (\"ANGI Homeservices,\" the \"Company,\" \"ANGI,\" \"we,\" \"our,\" or \"us\") connects millions of homeowners to home service professionals through its portfolio of digital home service brands, including HomeAdvisor\u00ae, Angie's List\u00ae and Handy. Combined, these leading marketplaces have collected more than 15 million reviews over the course of 20 years, allowing homeowners to research, match and connect on-demand to the largest network of service professionals online, through our mobile apps, or by voice assistants. ANGI Homeservices owns and operates brands in eight countries.\nThe HomeAdvisor digital marketplace service connects consumers with service professionals nationwide for home repair, maintenance and improvement projects. HomeAdvisor provides consumers with tools and resources to help them find local, pre-screened and customer-rated service professionals, as well as instantly book appointments with those professionals online or connect with them by telephone. Effective September 29, 2017, the Company also owns and operates Angie's List, Inc. (\"Angie's List\"), which connects consumers with service professionals for local services through a nationwide online directory of service professionals in over 700 service categories and provides consumers with valuable tools, services and content, including verified reviews, to help them research, shop and hire for local services. On October 19, 2018, the Company acquired Handy Technologies, Inc. (\"Handy\"), a leading platform in the United States for connecting individuals looking for household services (primarily cleaning and handyman services) with top-quality, pre-screened independent service professionals. We refer to the HomeAdvisor and Handy businesses in the United States as the (\"Marketplace\"). We also own and operate mHelpDesk and CraftJack. Prior to its sale on December 31, 2018, we also operated Felix.\nThe Company has two operating segments: (i) North America (United States and Canada), which includes HomeAdvisor, Angie's List, Handy, mHelpDesk and HomeStars, and (ii) Europe, which includes Travaux, MyHammer, MyBuilder, Werkspot and Instapro.\nThe Company markets its services to consumers through search engine marketing, television advertising and affiliate agreements with third parties. Pursuant to these affiliate agreements, third parties agree to advertise and promote Marketplace products and services and those of Marketplace service professionals on their platforms. In exchange for these efforts, the Company generally pays these third parties a fixed fee when visitors from their platforms click through to one of our platforms and submit a valid service request through the Marketplace, or when visitors submit a valid service request on the affiliate platform and the affiliate transmits the service request to the Marketplace. The Company also markets its services to consumers through email, digital display advertisements, partnerships with other contextually related websites and, to a lesser extent, through relationships with certain retailers, direct mail and radio advertising. The Company markets subscription packages and time-based advertising to service professionals primarily through its sales force, as well as through search engine marketing, digital media advertising and direct relationships with trade associations and manufacturers. We have made, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in digital and traditional advertising (with continued expansion into new and existing digital platforms) to consumers and service professionals to promote our products and services and to drive traffic to our various platforms and service professionals.\nOperating Metrics:\nIn connection with the management of our businesses, we identify, measure and assess a variety of operating metrics. The principal metrics we use in managing our businesses are set forth below:\n \u2022 Marketplace Revenue includes revenue from the HomeAdvisor and Handy domestic marketplace service, including consumer connection revenue for consumer matches, membership subscription revenue from HomeAdvisor service professionals and revenue from completed jobs sourced through the Handy platform. It excludes revenue from Angie's List, mHelpDesk, HomeStars and Felix. \n \u2022 Advertising & Other Revenue includes Angie's List revenue (revenue from service professionals under contract for advertising and membership subscription fees from consumers) as well as revenue from mHelpDesk, HomeStars and Felix. \n \u2022 Marketplace Service Requests are fully completed and submitted domestic customer service requests to HomeAdvisor and completed jobs sourced through the Handy platform. \n \u2022 Marketplace Paying Service Professionals (\"Marketplace Paying SPs\") are the number of HomeAdvisor and Handy domestic service professionals that had an active subscription and/or paid for consumer matches or completed \na job sourced through the Handy platform in the last month of the period. An active HomeAdvisor subscription is a subscription for which HomeAdvisor was recognizing revenue on the last day of the relevant period.\n \u2022 Advertising Service Professionals are the total number of Angie's List service professionals under contract for advertising at the end of the period.  Components of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nMarketplace Revenue is primarily derived from (i) consumer connection revenue, which comprises fees paid by HomeAdvisor service professionals for consumer matches (regardless of whether the service professional ultimately provides the requested service) and booking fees from completed jobs sourced through the Handy platform, and (ii) membership subscription fees paid by HomeAdvisor service professionals. Consumer connection revenue varies based upon several factors, including the service requested, product experience offered and geographic location of service. Effective with the Combination (described below), Advertising & Other Revenue is primarily derived from Angie's List (i) sales of time-based website, mobile and call center advertising to service professionals and (ii) membership subscription fees from consumers.\nOperating Costs and Expenses:\n \u2022 Cost of revenue - consists primarily of traffic acquisition costs, credit card processing fees, costs associated with publishing and distributing the Angie's List Magazine and hosting fees. Traffic acquisition costs include amounts based on revenue share arrangements. \n \u2022 Selling and marketing expense - consists primarily of advertising expenditures, which include online marketing, including fees paid to search engines, offline marketing, which is primarily television advertising, and partner-related payments to those who direct traffic to our brands, compensation expense (including stock-based compensation expense) and other employee-related costs for our sales force and marketing personnel, and facilities costs. \n \u2022 General and administrative expense - consists primarily of compensation expense (including stock-based compensation expense) and other employee-related costs for personnel engaged in executive management, finance, legal, tax, human resources and customer service functions, fees for professional services (including transaction-related costs related to acquisitions and the Combination), bad debt expense, software license and maintenance costs and facilities costs. Our customer service function includes personnel who provide support to our service professionals and consumers. \n \u2022 Product development expense - consists primarily of compensation expense (including stock-based compensation expense) and other employee-related costs that are not capitalized for personnel engaged in the design, development, testing and enhancement of product offerings and related technology, software license and maintenance costs and facilities costs.  Non-GAAP financial measure\nAdjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (\"Adjusted EBITDA\") is a non-GAAP financial measure. See \"Principles of Financial Reporting\" for the definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net earnings (loss) attributable to ANGI Homeservices Inc. shareholders to operating income (loss) to consolidated and combined Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016.\nThe Combination\nOn September 29, 2017, IAC/InterActiveCorp's (\"IAC\") HomeAdvisor business and Angie's List combined under a new publicly traded company called ANGI Homeservices Inc. (the \"Combination\"). At December 31, 2018, IAC owned 83.9% and 98.1% of the economic and voting interest, respectively, of ANGI Homeservices.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company incurred $3.6 million and $44.1 million, respectively, in costs related to this transaction (including severance, retention, transaction and integration related costs). In addition, the Company had deferred revenue write-offs of $5.5 million and $7.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe Company also incurred $70.6 million and $122.1 million in stock-based compensation expense during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, related to the modification of previously issued HomeAdvisor equity awards and previously issued Angie's List equity awards, both of which were converted into ANGI Homeservices' equity awards in the Combination, and the acceleration of certain converted equity awards resulting from the termination of Angie's List employees in connection with the Combination. Stock-based compensation expense arising from the Combination is expected to be approximately $35 million in 2019 and $20 million in 2020.\n2018 Developments\nOn December 31, 2018, ANGI sold Felix, which was included in our North America segment.\nOn November 5, 2018, ANGI entered into a five-year $250 million revolving credit facility (the \"Credit Facility\") and the term loan facility (the \"Term Loan\") was amended and restated, and is now due on November 5, 2023.\nOn October 19, 2018, ANGI acquired Handy, which is included in our North America segment.\n2018 Consolidated Results\nIn 2018, the Company delivered $395.9 million, or 54%, revenue growth, which was primarily driven by Marketplace Revenue growth of $193.1 million, or 33%; the contribution from Angie's List; and growth in Europe of $12.6 million, or 22%. Operating income increased $211.8 million to $63.9 million from a loss of $147.9 million in the prior year due primarily to an increase in Adjusted EBITDA of $208.3 million, or 532%, and a decrease of $52.2 million in stock-based compensation expense due primarily to a decrease in the modification and acceleration charges of $51.4 million related to the Combination, partially offset by increases of $39.0 million in amortization of intangibles principally due to the Combination and $9.8 million in depreciation. Adjusted EBITDA increased primarily due to the increase in revenue of $395.9 million, a decrease of $40.5 million in costs related to the Combination (including severance, retention, transaction and integration related costs) and lower selling and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue, partially offset by higher compensation expense due, in part, to increased headcount following the Combination, increases of $21.7 million in cost of revenue, $19.7 million in bad debt expense, $15.2 million in software license and maintenance costs and $9.4 million in facilities costs. Operating income and Adjusted EBITDA in 2018 benefited from a reduction in sales commissions expense of $4.9 million due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers on January 1, 2018. As a result of the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09, certain sales commissions, which represent the incremental direct costs of obtaining a service professional contract, are now capitalized and amortized over the estimated life of a service professional; these costs were expensed as incurred prior to January 1, 2018.\nIn addition to the Combination, other events affecting year-over-year comparability that occurred prior to 2018 include the acquisitions of controlling interests in MyBuilder Limited (\"MyBuilder\") on March 24, 2017 (reflected in the Europe segment) and HomeStars Inc. (\"HomeStars\") on February 8, 2017 (reflected in the North America segment).\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016\nRevenue\n\n________________________\nNA = Not applicable\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017\nNorth America revenue increased $383.3 million, or 56%, due to increases in Marketplace Revenue of $193.1 million, or 33%, and Advertising & Other Revenue of $190.2 million, or 195%. The increase in Marketplace Revenue is due to an increase in consumer connection revenue of $182.9 million, or 35%, which was driven by a 30% increase in Marketplace Service Requests to 23.5 million and an increase in membership subscription revenue of $10.1 million, or 18%, due to a 18% increase in Marketplace Paying SPs to 214,000. The increase in Advertising & Other Revenue was driven by the contribution from Angie's List, which reflects the write-off of deferred revenue due to the Combination of $5.5 million in 2018 compared to $7.8 million in 2017.\nEurope revenue grew $12.6 million, or 22%, driven by the acquisition of a controlling interest in MyBuilder on March 24, 2017, as well as growth across other regions. Europe revenue also benefited from the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to the Euro.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nNorth America revenue increased $217.1 million, or 47%, due to increases in Marketplace Revenue of $152.5 million, or 36%, and Advertising & Other Revenue of $64.5 million, or 196%. The increase in Marketplace Revenue is due to an increase in consumer connection revenue of $139.0 million, or 36%, which was driven by a 37% increase in Marketplace Service\nRequests to 18.1 million and an increase in membership subscription revenue of $12.6 million, or 29%, due to a 26% increase in Marketplace Paying SPs to 181,000. Advertising & Other Revenue in 2017 includes Angie's List since the date of the Combination, which reflects the write-off of deferred revenue due to the Combination of $7.8 million.\nEurope revenue grew $20.4 million, or 55%, driven by the acquisitions of controlling interests in MyHammer on November 3, 2016 and MyBuilder, as well as organic growth across other regions.\nCost of revenue\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017\nNorth America cost of revenue increased $21.5 million, or 66%, driven by increases of $7.2 million in traffic acquisition costs, $6.9 million in credit card processing fees due to $3.5 million from the inclusion of Angie's List and higher Marketplace Revenue, $3.7 million in costs associated with publishing and distributing the Angie's List Magazine and $2.6 million in hosting fees, principally from the inclusion of Angie's List.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nNorth America cost of revenue increased $7.2 million, or 28%, driven by increases of $4.2 million in credit card processing fees due to higher Marketplace Revenue and $1.4 million from the inclusion of Angie's List, and $2.1 million in hosting fees, of which $1.3 million was from the inclusion of Angie's List, partially offset by a reduction in traffic acquisition costs of $0.4 million.\nEurope cost of revenue increased $1.0 million, or 383%, driven by an increase of $0.9 million in hosting fees.\nSelling and marketing expense\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017\nNorth America selling and marketing expense increased $73.5 million, or 17%, but declined as a percentage of revenue. The increase in North America selling and marketing expense was driven by increases in advertising expense of $53.0 million, reflecting the impact from the inclusion of Angie's List, compensation expense of $11.8 million and facilities costs of $4.0 million. The increase in advertising expense is due primarily to increased investments in online marketing and television spend. Compensation expense increased due primarily to growth in the sales force, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense of $22.4 million and the inclusion of $7.4 million in severance and retention costs in 2017 related to the Combination. The decrease in stock-based compensation expense reflects decreases of $13.3 million in expense due to the modification of previously issued HomeAdvisor equity awards, which were converted into ANGI Homeservices' equity awards ($1.6 million in 2018 compared to $14.8 million in 2017), and $9.0 million in expense related to previously issued Angie's List equity awards, including the acceleration of certain converted equity awards resulting from the termination of Angie's List employees in connection with the Combination ($0.6 million in 2018 compared to $9.6 million in 2017). Compensation expense in 2018 also reflects a reduction in sales commissions expense of $4.9 million due to the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09. As a percentage of revenue, North America selling and marketing expense declined due, in part, to accelerated revenue growth driven by capacity expansion efforts combined with marketing optimization efforts.\nEurope selling and marketing expense increased $4.0 million, or 11%, driven by $3.6 million of increased expense from the inclusion of MyBuilder, principally related to advertising, and increases in compensation expense of $1.0 million and facilities costs of $1.0 million, partially offset by a decrease in advertising expense of $2.5 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nNorth America selling and marketing expense increased $142.8 million, or 50%, driven by an increase in advertising expense of $73.3 million, of which $5.3 million was from the inclusion of Angie's List, an increase of $62.4 million in compensation expense, of which $24.4 million was from the inclusion of Angie's List, as well as $2.5 million of expense from the acquisition of HomeStars. The increase in advertising expense is due primarily to increased organic investments in online marketing and television spend. Compensation expense increased due primarily to an increase of $24.9 million in stock-based compensation expense, of which $9.8 million was from the inclusion of Angie's List, an increase in the sales force and the inclusion of $7.4 million in severance and retention costs related to the Combination. The increase in stock-based compensation expense reflects $14.8 million of expense in 2017 due to the modification of previously issued HomeAdvisor equity awards, which were converted into ANGI Homeservices' equity awards, and $9.6 million of expense in 2017 related to previously issued Angie's List equity awards, including the acceleration of certain converted equity awards resulting from the termination of Angie's List employees in connection with the Combination.\nEurope selling and marketing expense increased $14.5 million, or 65%, driven by organic growth of $4.9 million in advertising expense and $2.5 million in compensation expense due, in part, to an increase in the sales force, as well as $7.0 million of expense from the acquisitions of MyHammer and MyBuilder.\nGeneral and administrative expense\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017\nNorth America general and administrative expense increased $24.9 million, or 9%, due primarily to an increase of $19.5 million in bad debt expense due, in part, to higher Marketplace Revenue, increases of $9.4 million in software license and maintenance costs and $3.7 million in facilities costs, both reflecting the impact from the inclusion of Angie's List, and an increase in customer service expense of $3.4 million, partially offset by a reduction in transaction and integration-related costs principally related to the Combination of $21.1 million. North America general and administrative expense also includes an increase in compensation expense of $1.0 million. The increase in compensation expense is due primarily to an increase in headcount following the Combination and existing business growth as well as $3.8 million from the inclusion of Handy, almost entirely offset by a decrease of $24.9 million in stock-based compensation expense and a decrease of $9.2 million in severance and retention costs related to the Combination ($2.7 million in 2018 compared to $11.8 million in 2017). The decrease in stock-based compensation expense reflects decreases of $12.9 million in expense due to the modification of previously issued HomeAdvisor equity awards, which were converted into ANGI Homeservices' equity awards ($52.9 million in 2018 compared to $65.7 million in 2017), and $9.6 million in expense related to previously issued Angie's List equity awards, including the acceleration of certain converted equity awards resulting from the termination of Angie's List employees in connection with the Combination ($8.1 million in 2018 compared to $17.7 million in 2017), and the inclusion in 2017 of a modification charge related to a HomeAdvisor equity award, partially offset by acceleration of expense related to certain equity awards in the fourth quarter of 2018 in connection with the chief executive officer transition and the issuance of new equity awards since 2017.\nEurope general and administrative expense decreased $1.9 million, or 7%, due primarily to a reduction in facilities costs and the inclusion in 2017 of $0.8 million of transaction-related costs primarily related to the acquisition of MyBuilder, partially offset by $1.1 million of increased expense from the inclusion of MyBuilder.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nNorth America general and administrative expense increased $181.8 million, or 200%, due primarily to higher compensation expense of $129.4 million, of which $38.4 million was from the inclusion of Angie's List, and $24.3 million in\ncosts related to the Combination including transaction related costs of $14.3 million and integration related costs of $10.0 million. The increase in compensation expense is due principally to an increase of $100.7 million in stock-based compensation expense, of which $18.0 million was from the inclusion of Angie's List, an increase in headcount from business growth and the inclusion of $11.8 million in severance and retention costs in 2017 related to the Combination. The increase in stock-based compensation expense reflects $65.7 million of expense in 2017 due to the modification of previously issued HomeAdvisor equity awards, which were converted into ANGI Homeservices' equity awards, and $17.7 million of expense in 2017 related to previously issued Angie's List equity awards, including the acceleration of certain converted equity awards resulting from the termination of Angie's List employees in connection with the Combination, as well as a modification charge related to a HomeAdvisor equity award in 2017. North America general and administrative expense also includes increases of $9.3 million in bad debt expense due to higher Marketplace Revenue, $3.9 million in customer service expense and $3.1 million in software license and maintenance costs, as well as $2.5 million of expense from the inclusion of HomeStars.\nEurope general and administrative expense increased $8.5 million, or 45%, due primarily to $7.3 million of expense from the inclusion of MyHammer and MyBuilder and an increase of $1.3 million in compensation expense due, in part, to increased headcount.\nProduct development expense\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017\nNorth America product development expense increased $8.1 million, or 19%, due primarily to an increase in software license and maintenance costs of $3.8 million, reflecting the impact from the inclusion of Angie's List, and an increase in compensation expense of $2.8 million. The increase in compensation expense is due primarily to increased headcount, partially offset by a decrease of $6.1 million in stock-based compensation expense resulting from a lower modification charge related to the Combination.\nEurope product development expense increased $5.1 million, or 116%, due to an increase of $1.5 million in compensation expense due, in part, to increased headcount, $1.1 million of increased expense from the inclusion of MyBuilder and increases in facilities costs of $0.7 million and software license and maintenance costs of $0.6 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nNorth America product development expense increased $25.6 million, or 142%, due primarily to an increase in compensation expense of $23.2 million, of which $6.8 million was from the inclusion of Angie's List, and $1.0 million of expense from the inclusion of HomeStars. The increase in compensation expense is due to an increase of $14.5 million in stock-based compensation expense principally due to the modification charge related to the Combination and increased headcount.\nEurope product development expense increased $1.7 million, or 66%, due to an increase of $1.9 million in compensation expense from the inclusion of MyHammer and MyBuilder.\nDepreciation\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017\nNorth America depreciation increased $8.6 million, or 65%, of which $2.2 million was from the inclusion of Angie's List and the remaining increase was due primarily to continued growth, including internally developed capitalized software. Europe depreciation increased $1.1 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nNorth America depreciation increased $5.2 million or 66%, and Europe depreciation increased $0.9 million, or 207%, due primarily to increased depreciation related to continued corporate growth, including acquisitions.\nOperating income (loss)\n\n________________________\nNM = Not meaningful\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017\nNorth America operating income increased $206.6 million to $78.1 million from a loss of $128.5 million in 2017 due primarily to an increase in Adjusted EBITDA of $203.8 million described below, and a decrease of $51.5 million in stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by increases of $40.0 million in amortization of intangibles and $8.6 million in depreciation. The decrease in stock-based compensation expense was due primarily to a decrease of $51.4 million in modification and acceleration charges related to the Combination and the inclusion in 2017 of a modification charge related to a HomeAdvisor equity award, partially offset by acceleration of expense related to certain equity awards in the fourth quarter of 2018 in connection with the chief executive officer transition and the issuance of new equity awards since 2017. The increase in amortization of intangibles was principally due to the Combination.\nEurope operating loss decreased $5.2 million, or 27%, due primarily to a reduction in Adjusted EBITDA loss of $4.6 million described below and decreases of $1.1 million in amortization of intangibles and $0.7 million in stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by an increase of $1.1 million in depreciation.\nAt December 31, 2018, there is $130.0 million of unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to all equity-based awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.0 years.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nNorth America operating income decreased $160.9 million to an operating loss of $128.5 million in 2017 as compared to operating income of $32.5 million in 2016, despite an increase of $0.1 million in Adjusted EBITDA described below, primarily due to an increase of $140.4 million in stock-based compensation expense, an increase of $15.3 million in amortization of intangibles and an increase of $5.2 million in depreciation. The increase in stock-based compensation expense was due primarily to modification and acceleration charges of $122.1 million related to the Combination and the inclusion in 2017 of a modification charge related to a HomeAdvisor equity award. The increase in amortization of intangibles was due principally to the Combination.\nEurope operating loss increased $11.0 million, or 131%, primarily due to an increase in Adjusted EBITDA loss of $5.5 million described below, an increase of $4.8 million in amortization of intangibles and an increase of $0.9 million in depreciation, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense of $0.1 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\nFor a reconciliation of net earnings (loss) attributable to ANGI Homeservices Inc. shareholders to operating income (loss) to consolidated and combined Adjusted EBITDA, see \"Principles of Financial Reporting.\" For a reconciliation of operating income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA for the Company's reportable segments, see \"Note 12-Segment Information\" to the consolidated and combined financial statements included in \"Item 8. Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017\nNorth America Adjusted EBITDA increased $203.8 million, or 406%, due primarily to the increase of $383.3 million in revenue, a reduction in transaction and integration-related costs principally related to the Combination of $38.3 million and lower selling and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue, partially offset by higher compensation expense due, in part, to increased headcount following the Combination and, as described above, increases of $21.5 million in cost of revenue, $19.5 million in bad debt expense, $14.8 million in software license and maintenance costs and $8.0 million in facilities costs.\nEurope Adjusted EBITDA loss decreased $4.6 million, or 41%, due primarily to the increase of $12.6 million in revenue, of which $6.9 million was from MyBuilder, and the decrease in advertising expense of $2.5 million, partially offset by $5.8 million of expense from the inclusion of MyBuilder primarily related to advertising, higher compensation expense of $3.6 million primarily due to increased headcount and an increase in facilities costs of $0.7 million. Additionally, Europe Adjusted EBITDA loss in 2017 includes $0.8 million of transaction-related costs primarily related to the acquisition of MyBuilder.\nAdjusted EBITDA in 2018 benefited from a reduction in sales commissions expense of $4.9 million for North America due to the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 on January 1, 2018.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nNorth America Adjusted EBITDA increased $0.1 million, despite the significant increase of $217.1 million in revenue, due primarily to an increase in advertising expense of $73.3 million, higher compensation expense due, in part, to increased headcount, the inclusion in 2017 of $44.1 million in costs related to the Combination (including severance, retention, transaction and integration related costs) and increases of $9.3 million in bad debt expense due to higher revenue, $3.9 million in customer service expense and $3.1 million in software license and maintenance costs. Adjusted EBITDA in 2017 was further impacted by write-offs of deferred revenue related to the Combination of $7.8 million and the acquisition of HomeStars of $0.7 million.\nEurope Adjusted EBITDA loss increased $5.5 million, or 99%, driven primarily by our European expansion strategy including an increase in advertising expense of $10.7 million and higher compensation expense of $10.5 million both due primarily to the inclusion of MyHammer and MyBuilder. The increase in compensation expense was also due to increased organic headcount.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense-third-party relates to interest on the Term Loan, which commenced on November 1, 2017 and commitment fees on the undrawn Credit Facility, which commenced on November 5, 2018.\nInterest expense-related party includes interest charged by IAC and its subsidiaries on related party notes, which were primarily related to acquisitions. All related party notes were settled prior to the Combination, with the exception of a promissory note payable to a foreign subsidiary of IAC. For a detailed description of long-term debt-related party, see \"Note\n15-Related Party Transactions with IAC\" to the consolidated and combined financial statements included in \"Item 8. Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\n\nOther income (expense), net\n\nOther income, net in 2018 includes a gain of $13.2 million related to the sale of Felix and third-party interest income of $4.8 million.\nOther income (expense), net in 2017 and 2016 is principally net foreign currency exchange gains (losses).\nIncome tax benefit (provision)\n\nIn 2018, the income tax benefit, despite pre-tax income, is due primarily to excess tax benefits generated by the exercise and vesting of stock-based awards.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\"). The Tax Act implemented a number of changes that took effect on January 1, 2018, including but not limited to, a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and a new minimum tax on global intangible low-taxed income earned by foreign subsidiaries. The Company was able to make a reasonable estimate of the impacts of the Tax Act in the fourth quarter of 2017 as described below. In the third quarter of 2018, the Company finalized its calculations related to the impacts of the Tax Act with no adjustment in 2018 to the Company's previously recorded provisional tax expense.\nIn 2017, the effective income tax rate is lower than the statutory rate of 35% due primarily to the effect of the Tax Act, largely offset by adopting the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, on January 1, 2017. The Tax Act required a remeasurement of U.S. net deferred tax assets due to the reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, resulting in a tax expense of $33.0 million. The Company was not subject to the one-time transition tax because it has cumulative losses from its international operations. Under ASU No. 2016-09, excess tax benefits generated by the settlement or exercise of stock-based awards of $35.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 are recognized as a reduction to the income tax provision rather than as an increase to additional paid-in capital.\nIn 2016, the effective income tax rate is higher than the statutory rate of 35% due primarily to unbenefited losses in separate jurisdictions and state taxes, partially offset by research credits.\nFor further details of income tax matters, see \"Note 3-Income Taxes\" to the consolidated and combined financial statements included in \"Item 8. Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL REPORTING\nWe report Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). This measure is one of the primary metrics by which we evaluate the performance of our businesses, on which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated. We believe that investors should have access to, and we are obligated to provide, the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results. This non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. We endeavor to compensate for the limitations of the non-GAAP measure presented by providing the comparable GAAP measure with equal or greater prominence and descriptions of the reconciling items, including quantifying such items, to derive the non-GAAP measure. We encourage investors to examine the reconciling adjustments between the GAAP and non-GAAP measure, which we discuss below.\nDefinition of Non-GAAP Measure\nAdjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (\"Adjusted EBITDA\") is defined as operating income excluding: (1) stock-based compensation expense; (2) depreciation; and (3) acquisition-related items consisting of amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets, if applicable. We believe this measure is useful for analysts and investors as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison between our performance and that of our competitors. The above items are excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA measure because these items are non-cash in nature. Adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to our consolidated and combined statement of operations of certain expenses.\nThe following table reconciles net earnings (loss) attributable to ANGI Homeservices Inc. shareholders to operating income (loss) to consolidated and combined Adjusted EBITDA:\n\nFor a reconciliation of operating income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA for the Company's reportable segments, see \"Note 12-Segment Information\" to the consolidated and combined financial statements included in \"Item 8. Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nNon-Cash Expenses That Are Excluded from Non-GAAP Measure\nStock-based compensation expense consists principally of expense associated with the grants, including unvested grants assumed in acquisitions (including the Combination), of stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units, or RSUs, stock options and performance-based RSUs. These expenses are not paid in cash, and we include the related shares in our fully diluted shares outstanding using the treasury stock method. Performance-based RSUs are included only to the extent the applicable performance condition(s) have been met (assuming the end of the reporting period is the end of the contingency period). To the extent that stock-based awards are settled on a net basis, the Company remits the required tax-withholding amount from its current funds.\nDepreciation is a non-cash expense relating to our property and equipment and is computed using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated useful lives, or, in the case of leasehold improvements, the lease term, if shorter.\nAmortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets are non-cash expenses related primarily to acquisitions (including the Combination). At the time of an acquisition, the identifiable definite-lived intangible assets of the acquired company, such as service professional and contractor relationships, technology, memberships, customer lists and user base, and trade names, are valued and amortized over their estimated lives. Value is also assigned to acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets, which comprise trade names and trademarks, and goodwill that are not subject to amortization. An impairment is recorded when the carrying value of an intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value. We believe that intangible assets represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to acquisition and the related amortization and impairment charges of intangible assets or goodwill, if applicable, are not ongoing costs of doing business.\nFINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nFinancial Position \n_________________________________________________________________________\n (a) If needed for U.S. operations, the cash and cash equivalents held by the Company's foreign subsidiaries could be repatriated without significant tax consequences.  For a detailed description of long-term debt, see \"Note 7-Long-term Debt\" and for a detailed description of long-term debt-related party, see \"Note 15-Related Party Transactions with IAC\" to the consolidated and combined financial statements included in \"Item 8. Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nCash Flow Information\nIn summary, the Company's cash flows are as follows:\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities consists of earnings adjusted for non-cash items and the effect of changes in working capital. Non-cash adjustments include stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangibles, bad debt expense, depreciation, gain from the sale of a business, and deferred income taxes.\nAdjustments to earnings consist primarily of $97.1 million of stock-based compensation expense, $62.2 million of amortization of intangibles, $47.2 million of bad debt expense and $24.3 million of depreciation, partially offset by $13.2 million in gain from the sale of Felix and $8.4 million of deferred income taxes. The deferred income tax benefit primarily\nrelates to amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by the utilization of net operating losses. The decrease from changes in working capital consists primarily of an increase in accounts receivable of $47.7 million and an increase in other assets of $13.0 million. The increase in accounts receivable is primarily due to revenue growth in North America. The increase in other assets is due to increases in capitalized sales commissions and prepaid marketing.\nNet cash used in investing activities includes capital expenditures of $47.0 million, primarily related to investments in the development of capitalized software to support the Company's products and services, leasehold improvements and computer hardware, and purchases (net of maturities) of marketable debt securities of $24.7 million, partially offset by $10.4 million in net proceeds from the sale of Angie's List's campus located in Indianapolis and $3.7 million in cash from the acquisition of Handy, net of cash consideration paid.\nNet cash used in financing activities includes $29.8 million for the payment of withholding taxes on behalf of employees for stock-based awards that were net settled, $13.8 million in principal payments on the Term Loan and $6.1 million for the purchase of noncontrolling interests, partially offset by $4.7 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\nAdjustments to earnings consist primarily of $149.2 million of stock-based compensation expense, $27.5 million of bad debt expense, $23.3 million of amortization of intangibles and $14.5 million of depreciation, partially offset by $48.4 million of deferred income taxes. The deferred income tax benefit primarily relates to the modification charge for the conversion and acceleration of stock-based awards related to the Combination, the net operating loss created by the exercise of HomeAdvisor stock-based awards and the one-time charges related to the Combination. The decrease from changes in working capital consists primarily of an increase in accounts receivable of $33.2 million, partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue of $11.0 million. The increase in accounts receivable is primarily due to revenue growth in North America. The increase in deferred revenue is due to growth in subscription sales and time-based advertising to service professionals.\nNet cash used in investing activities includes $66.3 million of cash used for the acquisitions of MyBuilder, Angie's List, and HomeStars, and capital expenditures of $26.8 million, primarily related to investments in the development of capitalized software to support our products and services and computer hardware. The cash used for the acquisition of Angie's List includes $61.5 million that the Company loaned to Angie's List to fund the repayment of Angie's List debt outstanding immediately prior to the Combination.\nNet cash provided by financing activities includes proceeds from borrowings under the Term Loan of $275.0 million, proceeds from borrowings of related party debt of $131.4 million, including $61.5 million in borrowings from IAC used by the Company to fund the repayment of Angie's List debt immediately prior to the Combination, and cash transfers of $24.2 million from IAC pursuant to IAC's centrally managed U.S. treasury management function, partially offset by principal payments on related party debt of $181.6 million, the purchase of noncontrolling interests of $12.8 million and $10.1 million for the payment of withholding taxes on behalf of employees for stock-based awards that were net settled. The principal payments on related party debt include repayment of $61.5 million in borrowings from IAC used by the Company to fund the repayment of Angie's List debt immediately prior to the Combination.\nAdjustments to earnings consist primarily of $17.4 million of bad debt expense, $8.9 million of stock-based compensation expense, $8.4 million of depreciation and $3.2 million of amortization of intangibles, partially offset by $3.7 million of deferred income taxes. The deferred income tax benefit primarily relates to stock-based compensation expense. The increase from changes in working capital consists primarily of an increase in accounts payable and other liabilities of $14.9 million, an increase in income taxes payable and receivable of $6.9 million and an increase in deferred revenue of $6.9 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $23.9 million and an increase in other assets of $3.0 million. The increase in accounts payable and other liabilities is due to the timing of payments and an increase in employee-related accruals. The increase in income taxes payable and receivable is due to current year income tax accruals in excess of current year income tax payments. The increase in deferred revenue is primarily due to the growth in subscription sales to service professionals. The increase in accounts receivable is primarily due to revenue growth in North America. The increase in other assets is due to an increase in prepaid marketing.\nNet cash used in investing activities includes $15.6 million of cash used for the acquisition of MyHammer and capital expenditures of $16.7 million, primarily related to a new sales center and investments in the development of capitalized software to support our products and services.\nNet cash provided by financing activities includes $44.8 million in proceeds from borrowings of related party debt principally used to fund the acquisition of MyHammer, partially offset by the refinancing of an $11.4 million promissory note, and cash transfers of $4.3 million to IAC pursuant to IAC's centrally managed U.S. treasury management function.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIn periods prior to the Combination, the Company received funding from IAC, including loans from certain IAC foreign subsidiaries, the proceeds of which were primarily used to fund acquisitions.\nAll outstanding long-term debt-related party amounts due between certain IAC subsidiaries and the HomeAdvisor business were settled prior to the completion of the Combination, with the exception of a promissory note payable to a foreign subsidiary of IAC, the principal amount of which at December 31, 2018 was \u20ac0.9 million ($1.0 million).\nOn November 1, 2017, the Company borrowed $275 million under a five-year term loan facility (\"Term Loan\"). On November 5, 2018, the Term Loan was amended and restated, and is now due on November 5, 2023. Interest payments are due at least quarterly through the term of the loan and quarterly principal payments of 1.25% of the original principal amount in the first three years from the amendment date, 2.50% in the fourth year and 3.75% in the fifth year are required. At December 31, 2018, the Term Loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.50%, or 3.98%, which is subject to change in future periods based on the Company's consolidated net leverage ratio.\nOn November 5, 2018, the Company entered into a five-year $250 million revolving credit facility (the \"Credit Facility\"). The annual commitment fee on undrawn funds is currently 25 basis points and is based on the consolidated net leverage ratio most recently reported. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at the Company's option, at either a base rate or LIBOR, in each case plus an applicable margin, which is determined by reference to a pricing grid based on the Company's consolidated net leverage ratio. At December 31, 2018, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility.\nBoth the Term Loan and Credit Facility borrowings are guaranteed by the Company's wholly-owned material domestic subsidiaries and are secured by substantially all assets of the Company and the guarantors, subject to certain exceptions. The terms of the Credit Facility and the Term Loan require ANGI to maintain a consolidated net leverage ratio of not more than 4.5 to 1.0 and a minimum interest coverage ratio of not less than 2.0 to 1.0. There are additional covenants under both the Term Loan and the Credit Facility that limit the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur indebtedness, pay dividends or make distributions.\nOn February 6, 2019, the Board of Directors of ANGI Homeservices authorized the Company to repurchase up to 15 million shares of its common stock.\nIn connection with the Combination, previously issued stock appreciation rights related to the common stock of HomeAdvisor (US) were converted into ANGI stock appreciation rights that are settleable, at the Company's option, on a net basis with ANGI remitting withholding taxes on behalf of the employee or on a gross basis with the Company issuing a sufficient number of Class A shares to cover the withholding taxes. In addition, at IAC's option, these awards can be settled in either Class A shares of ANGI or shares of IAC common stock. If settled in IAC common stock, ANGI reimburses IAC in either cash or through the issuance of Class A shares to IAC. Assuming all of the stock appreciation rights outstanding on February 1, 2019 were net settled on that date, ANGI would have issued 13.0 million Class A shares (either to IAC as reimbursement or to award holders) and ANGI would have remitted $219.6 million in cash for withholding taxes (assuming a 50% withholding rate). If the Company decided to issue a sufficient number of shares to cover the $219.6 million employee withholding tax obligation, 13.0 million additional Class A shares would be issued by ANGI. The Company's cash withholding obligation on all other ANGI net settled awards outstanding on February 1, 2019 is $38.5 million (assuming a 50% withholding rate), which is the equivalent of 2.3 million shares.\nIn addition, prior to the Combination in 2017, IAC issued a number of IAC denominated PSUs to certain ANGI employees. Vesting of the PSUs is contingent upon ANGI's performance. Assuming all of the PSUs outstanding on February 1, 2019 were net settled on that date, ANGI would have issued 0.7 million Class A shares (either to IAC as reimbursement or to award holders) and ANGI would have remitted $12.0 million in cash for withholding taxes (assuming a 50% withholding rate).\nThe Company believes its existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, available borrowings under the Credit Facility and expected positive cash flows generated from operations will be sufficient to fund its normal operating requirements, including capital expenditures, debt service, the payment of withholding taxes on behalf of employees for any stock-based awards that may be net settled, and investing and other commitments, for the foreseeable future. The Company's\n2019 capital expenditures are expected to be higher than 2018 by approximately 30% to 35%, driven, in part, by higher capital expenditures related to the development of capitalized software to support the Company's products and services. The Company's liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for its products and services.\nThe Company's indebtedness could limit its ability to: (i) obtain additional financing to fund working capital needs, acquisitions, capital expenditures or debt service or other requirements; and (ii) use operating cash flow to make certain acquisitions or investments, in the event a default has occurred or, in certain circumstances, if its leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility and Term Loan) exceeds the ratios set forth in the Term Loan. There were no such limitations at December 31, 2018.\nAt December 31, 2018, IAC held all Class B shares of ANGI which represent 83.9% of the economic interest and 98.1% of the voting interest of ANGI. As a result, IAC has the ability to control ANGI's financing activities, including the issuance of additional debt and equity securities by ANGI or any of its subsidiaries, or the incurrence of other indebtedness generally. While ANGI is expected to have the ability to access debt and equity markets if needed, such transactions may require the approval of IAC due to its control of the majority of the outstanding voting power of ANGI's capital stock and its representation on the ANGI board of directors. Additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to the Company or at all.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\n\n______________________________________________\n (a) The Company has excluded $1.9 million in unrecognized tax benefits from the table above as we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which these liabilities might be paid. For additional information on income taxes, see \"Note 3-Income Taxes\" to the consolidated and combined financial statements included in \"Item 8. Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" \n (b) Long-term debt consists of contractual amounts due including interest on a variable rate instrument. Long-term debt at December 31, 2018 consists of the $261.3 million Term Loan, bearing interest at LIBOR plus 1.50%, or 3.98%, at December 31, 2018. The Term Loan interest rate is subject to change in future periods based on the Company's consolidated net leverage ratio. The amount of interest ultimately paid on the variable rate debt may differ based on changes in interest rates. For additional information on long-term debt, see \"Note 7-Long-term Debt\" to the consolidated and combined financial statements included in \"Item 8. Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" \n (c) Long-term debt-related party consists of a promissory note of \u20ac0.9 million ($1.0 million at December 31, 2018) payable to a foreign subsidiary of IAC, which bears interest at a fixed rate. For additional information on long-term debt-related party, see \"Note 15-Related Party Transactions with IAC\" to the consolidated and combined financial statements included in \"Item 8. Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" \n (d) We lease office space, data center facilities and equipment used in connection with our operations under various operating leases, the majority of which contain escalation clauses. For additional information on operating leases, see \"Note 13-Commitments and Contingencies\" to the consolidated and combined financial statements included in \"Item 8. Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" \n (e) Purchase obligations primarily consist of software licenses and advertising commitments.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOther than the items described above, the Company does not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2018.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe following disclosure is provided to supplement the descriptions of ANGI Homeservices' accounting policies contained in \"Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to the consolidated and combined financial statements included \"Item 8. Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" in regard to significant areas of judgment. Management of the Company is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions during the preparation of its consolidated and combined financial statements in accordance with GAAP. These estimates, judgments and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated and combined financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Because of the size of the financial statement elements to which they relate, some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on our consolidated and combined financial statements than others. What follows is a discussion of some of our more significant accounting policies and estimates.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts and Revenue Reserves\nThe Company makes judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables and provides allowances when it has determined that all or a portion of the receivable will not be collected. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide for the estimated amount of accounts receivable that will not be collected. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon a number of factors, including the length of time accounts receivable are past due, the Company's previous loss history and the specific customer's ability to pay its obligation to the Company. The term between the Company issuance of an invoice and payment due date is not significant. The Company also maintains allowances to reserve for potential credits issued to service professionals or other revenue adjustments. The amounts of these reserves are based primarily upon historical experience. The carrying value of the allowance for doubtful accounts and revenue reserves is $16.6 million and $9.3 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Bad debt expense was $47.2 million, $27.5 million and $17.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nBusiness Combinations\nAcquisitions are an important part of the Company's growth strategy. The Company invested $167.8 million (including the value of ANGI Homeservices Class A common stock issued in connection with the acquisition of Handy), $819.0 million (including the value of ANGI Homeservices Class A common stock issued in connection with the Combination) and $19.7 million in acquisitions for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The purchase price of each acquisition is attributed to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition, including identifiable intangible assets that either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill. The fair value of these intangible assets is based on valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management. The excess purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets is recorded as goodwill and is assigned to the reporting unit(s) that is expected to benefit from the combination as of the acquisition date.\nRecoverability of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nGoodwill is the Company's largest asset with a carrying value of $894.7 million and $770.2 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which consist of the Company's acquired trade names and trademarks, have a carrying value of $171.5 million and $153.4 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed annually for impairment as of October 1, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value. In performing its annual assessment, the Company has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value.\nFor the Company's annual goodwill test at October 1, 2018, a qualitative assessment of the North America and Europe reporting units' goodwill was performed because the Company concluded it was more likely than not that the fair value of these reporting units was in excess of their respective carrying values. In the aggregate, ANGI Homeservices' October 1, 2018 market capitalization of $10.7 billion exceeded its carrying value by approximately $9.6 billion. The primary factor that the Company considered in its qualitative assessment for its Europe reporting unit were valuations performed during 2018 that indicated fair value in excess of the carrying value. The fair value of the valuation that was most proximate to, but not as of, October 1, 2018 exceeded the carrying value of the Europe reporting unit by $102.7 million. The primary factors that the Company considered in its qualitative assessment for its North America reporting unit were the strong operating performance of the North America reporting unit and the significant excess of the estimated fair value of the North America reporting unit over\nits carrying value. The fair value of the North America reporting unit was estimated by subtracting the fair value of the Europe reporting unit, from the valuation described above, from the October 1, 2018 market capitalization of the Company; the estimated fair value of the North America reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately $9.5 billion.\nThe annual quantitative test of the recovery of goodwill involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the Company reporting unit that is being tested to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment equal to the excess is recorded.\nThe fair value of the Company's Europe reporting unit is determined using both an income approach based on discounted cash flows (\"DCF\") and a market approach when it tests goodwill for impairment, either on an interim basis or annual basis as of October 1 each year. Determining fair value using a DCF analysis requires the exercise of significant judgment with respect to several items, including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates. The expected cash flows used in the DCF analyses are based on the Company's most recent forecast and budget and, for years beyond the budget, the Company's estimates, which are based, in part, on forecasted growth rates. The discount rates used in the DCF analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows of the respective reporting units. Assumptions used in the DCF analyses, including the discount rate, are assessed based on the reporting units' current results and forecasted future performance, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors. The discount rate used in determining the fair value of the Company's Europe reporting unit was 15.0% in 2018. Determining fair value using a market approach considers multiples of financial metrics based on both acquisitions and trading multiples of a selected peer group of companies. From the comparable companies, a representative market multiple is determined which is applied to financial metrics to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. To determine a peer group of companies for our respective reporting units, we considered companies relevant in terms of consumer use, monetization model, margin and growth characteristics, and brand strength operating in their respective sectors. While a primary driver in the determination of the fair values of the Company's reporting units is the estimate of future revenue and profitability, the determination of fair value is based, in part, upon the Company's assessment of macroeconomic factors, industry and competitive dynamics and the strategies of its businesses in response to these factors.\nWhile the Company has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of its indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than their carrying values, the Company's policy is to determine the fair value of each of its indefinite-lived intangible assets annually as of October 1. The Company determines the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets using an avoided royalty DCF valuation analysis. Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the selection of appropriate royalty and discount rates and estimating the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. The discount rates used in the DCF analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets. The royalty rates used in the DCF analyses are based upon an estimate of the royalty rates that a market participant would pay to license the Company's trade names and trademarks. Assumptions used in the avoided royalty DCF analyses, including the discount rate and royalty rate, are assessed annually based on the actual and projected cash flows related to the asset, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors. The discount rate used in the Company's annual indefinite-lived impairment assessment ranged from 11.5% to 27.5% in 2018 and 11.5% to 18.5% in 2017, and the royalty rate used ranged from 1.5% to 5.5% in 2018 and 1.0% to 6.0% in 2017.\nThe 2018, 2017 and 2016 annual assessments of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets identified no impairments.\nRecoverability and Estimated Useful Lives of Long-Lived Assets\nWe review the carrying value of all long-lived assets, comprising property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If the carrying value is deemed not to be recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. In addition, the Company reviews the useful lives of its long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these lives may be changed. The carrying value of property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets is $203.7 million and $228.4 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company is included within IAC's tax group for purposes of federal and consolidated state income tax return filings. In all periods presented, current and deferred income tax benefit and provision have been computed for the Company on an as if standalone, separate return basis. The Company's payments to IAC for its share of IAC's consolidated federal and state tax\nreturn liabilities have been reflected within cash flows from operating activities in the accompanying consolidated and combined statement of cash flows. The tax sharing agreement between the Company and IAC governs the parties' respective rights, responsibilities and obligations with respect to tax matters, including responsibility for taxes attributable to the Company, entitlement to refunds, allocation of tax attributes and other matters. Any differences between taxes currently due or receivable under the tax sharing agreement and the current tax provision computed on an as if standalone, separate return basis for GAAP are payable to or receivable from IAC and are reflected as adjustments to additional paid-in capital. The portion of the December 31, 2018 deferred tax assets that will be payable to IAC pursuant to the tax sharing agreement, upon realization, is $54.7 million.\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method, and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is provided if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the balance of the Company's net deferred tax asset is $37.0 million and $45.1 million, respectively.\nThe Company evaluates and accounts for uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. Recognition (step one) occurs when the Company concludes that a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is more-likely-than-not to be sustainable upon examination. Measurement (step two) determines the amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. De-recognition of a tax position that was previously recognized would occur when the Company subsequently determines that a tax position no longer meets the more-likely-than-not threshold of being sustained. This measurement step is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we have unrecognized tax benefits of $2.4 million and $1.5 million, respectively. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustment and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. Although management currently believes changes to reserves from period to period and differences between amounts paid, if any, upon resolution of issues raised in audits and amounts previously provided will not have a material impact on liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of the Company, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management's view of these matters may change in the future.\nThe ultimate amount of deferred income tax assets realized and the amounts paid for deferred income tax liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits may vary from our estimates due to future changes in income tax law, state income tax apportionment or the outcome of any review of our tax returns by the various tax authorities, as well as actual operating results of the Company that vary significantly from anticipated results.\nThe Company regularly assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets considering all available evidence including, to the extent applicable, the nature, frequency and severity of prior cumulative losses, forecasts of future taxable income, tax filing status, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, available tax planning and historical experience. As of December 31, 2018, the Company is in a three-year cumulative loss position because of costs incurred in connection with the Combination. The Company's most significant net deferred tax asset relates to U.S. federal net operating loss (\"NOL\") carryforwards of $58.1 million. Based upon current forecasts of future profits, the Company does not expect to be in a three-year cumulative loss position as of December 31, 2019. The Company expects to generate future taxable income of at least $276.7 million prior to the expiration of these NOLs between 2027 and 2037 to fully realize this deferred tax asset.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense reflected in our consolidated and combined statement of operations consists of expense related to the Company's stock appreciation rights, stock options and RSUs, equity instruments denominated in shares of subsidiaries, and IAC denominated stock options and PSUs held by ANGI Homeservices employees.\nThe Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $97.1 million, $149.2 million and $8.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Included in stock-based compensation expense in 2018 and 2017 is $70.6 million and $122.1 million, respectively, related to the modification of previously issued HomeAdvisor equity awards and previously issued Angie's List equity awards, both of which were converted into ANGI Homeservices' equity awards in the Combination, and the acceleration of certain converted equity awards resulting from the termination of Angie's List employees in connection with the Combination. The Company estimates the fair value of stock appreciation rights (including those modified in connection with the Combination) and stock options, including equity instruments denominated in shares of subsidiaries, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions, the most significant of which include expected term, expected volatility of the underlying\nshares, risk-free interest rates and the expected dividend yield. In addition, the recognition of stock-based compensation expense is impacted by our estimated forfeiture rates, which are based, in part, on historical forfeiture rates. For stock appreciation rights and stock options, including equity instruments denominated in shares of subsidiaries, the grant date fair value of the award is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period of the award. The impact on stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2018, assuming a 1% increase in the risk-free interest rate, a 10% increase in the volatility factor and a one-year increase in the weighted average expected term of the outstanding awards would be an increase of $1.3 million, $3.0 million and $1.3 million, respectively. For RSUs, the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of the underlying ANGI Homeservices common stock and expensed as stock-based compensation expense over the vesting term.\nPrior to the Combination, the majority of stock-based compensation expense is related to HomeAdvisor (US) denominated stock appreciation rights and the common stock of certain other entities comprising the HomeAdvisor business. These awards were settleable in shares of IAC common stock having a value equal to the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value of the common stock of the relevant entity of the HomeAdvisor business. Upon completion of the Combination, the stock appreciation rights that related to the common stock of HomeAdvisor (US) were converted into awards that are settleable in Class A shares of our common stock, or in shares of IAC common stock at IAC's election. The equity awards that are denominated in the shares of certain subsidiaries comprising the HomeAdvisor business are also settleable in Class A shares of our common stock, or in shares of IAC common stock at IAC's election. To the extent shares of IAC common stock are issued in settlement of these awards, the Company will reimburse IAC for the cost of those shares by issuing additional Class A shares of its common stock to IAC. For IAC equity awards held by employees of ANGI Homeservices, the Company will reimburse IAC for the cost of those shares by issuing to IAC, at IAC's election, either cash or additional Class B shares of its common stock.\nMarketable Debt Securities\nThe Company invests in marketable debt securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity to fund current operations or satisfy other cash requirements as needed. Marketable debt securities are adjusted to fair value each quarter, and the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of shareholders' equity. The specific-identification method is used to determine the cost of debt securities sold and the amount of unrealized gains and losses reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings. We review our debt securities for impairment each reporting period. The Company recognizes an unrealized loss on debt securities in net earnings when the impairment is determined to be other-than-temporary. Factors we consider in making such determination include the duration, severity and reason for the decline in value and the potential recovery and our intent to sell the debt security. We also consider whether we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis and whether the amortized cost basis cannot be recovered because of credit losses. If an impairment is considered to be other-than-temporary, the debt security will be written down to its fair value and the loss will be recognized within other income (expense), net. The carrying value of marketable debt securities at December 31, 2018, is $24.9 million and consist of treasury discount notes.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see \"Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to the consolidated and combined financial statements included in \"Item 8.

ANGI aims to connect homeowners to home service professionals through well-known digital brands including HomeAdvisor, Angie's List, and Handy. The report outlines that the company has revenue streams from its marketplaces, which include consumer connection revenue and membership subscription revenue. Additionally, revenue is generated through advertising and other forms such as Angie's List and software offerings like mHelpDesk.\n\nThe company has operated with a focus on digital and traditional advertising to target both consumers and service professionals. Key operational metrics include Marketplace Revenue, Advertising & Other Revenue, Marketplace Service Requests, and Marketplace Paying Service Professionals.\n\nThe report includes a detailed discussion of the company's operating costs and expenses, including cost of revenue (traffic acquisition costs, credit card processing fees, hosting fees, etc.), selling and marketing expenses, general and administrative expenses, and product development expenses. There's also the consideration of a non-GAAP financial measure - Adjusted EBITDA, which is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, adjusted for specific items, and is a key metric used by management.\n\nThe Combination mentioned refers to HomeAdvisor's union with Angie's List in September 2017, creating ANGI Homeservices Inc. This transaction incurred significant costs and had various implications for the company's financial situation.\n\nSeveral developments in 2018 include the sale of Felix (part of the North America segment), entry into a five-year $250 million revolving credit facility, and the acquisition of Handy.\n\nConsolidated 2018 results showed a 54% revenue growth, predominantly from Marketplace Revenue growth and contributions from Angie's List. Operationally, the company reported an increased operating income, primarily driven by growth in Adjusted EBITDA and a reduction in stock-based compensation expense associated with the Combination. Adjusted EBITDA benefited from increased revenue, decrease in costs related to the Combination, and lower selling and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue, among other factors.\n\nThe report concludes with extensive discussions on the company's financial position, liquidity, capital resources, accounting policies, and estimates - which include assessments of collectability of receivables, provisions for doubtful accounts, valuation of acquisitions and goodwill, tax positions, and treatment of stock-based compensation. There's also a look at marketable debt securities and off-balance sheet arrangements, as well as a discussion of certain critical accounting policies that involve significant judgment by management.\n\nThis summary covers the broad aspects of the MD&A report, though it omits the very detailed data found in the tables of the original document."}
