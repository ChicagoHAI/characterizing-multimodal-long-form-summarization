This information is intended to facilitate the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to our financial condition and the results of operations. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nExecutive Summary\nThis summary is intended to identify the most important matters on which management focuses when it evaluates the financial condition and performance of the Bank. When evaluating financial condition and performance, management looks at certain key\nmetrics and measures. The Bank's evaluation includes comparisons with peer group financial institutions and its own performance objectives established in internal planning processes.\nThe primary activity of the Bank is commercial banking, as it has been since the Bank opened in Guam in 1972. The Company's operations are located entirely in the U.S. territories, the U.S.-affiliated nations of the western Pacific, and in the San Francisco Bay area of California. The largest community in the Bank's western Pacific market is Guam, followed by the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. The market includes a number of transportation-, travel- and tourism-related companies in the region, as well as substantial U.S. Department of Defense and other U.S. federal government activities in Guam. The Company's customers are primarily transnational corporations, governments, closely-held businesses and individuals.\nDuring 2017, there were four significant factors that impacted the Company's financial condition and operations:\nTable 39: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Over the course of the year, tourist arrivals continued to increase in Guam and other islands in the region. In Guam, the number of visitors reached its highest level in history, at 1.54 million. This was due, in part, to the fact that a moderate, 3.5% decrease in Japanese arrivals was more than offset by increasing arrivals from South Korea and China, with the latter two increasing by 27.4% and 14.0%, respectively. The continuing growth in Guam's tourism industry and increasing arrivals in the other islands led to modest improvements in payroll employment and other aspects of the regional economy, enhancing the Bank's business.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 40: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The military buildup continues, and substantial funding is finally being provided for the relocation of U.S. Marines from Okinawa to Guam. Several contracts, totaling hundreds of millions of dollars, were executed during 2017, and additional years of construction and related activity are expected to bring additional investment and income to Guam. Once completed, the activities that these projects support will provide a sustained contribution to the economy.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 41: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The continuing strength of the economy in the San Francisco Bay area provided ample opportunities to expand the Bank's business there, leading to an increase of 16.0% in the California region's loan portfolio, supplementing 22.6% growth in loans in the Freely Associated States of Micronesia markets and supporting overall growth of 4.6% in the total loan portfolio, as loans in Guam decreased by 2.2%. The 2.2% growth in the Bank's asset base supported a 4.6% expansion of our gross loan portfolio and an increase of 6.7% in our investment portfolio as we also converted $50.5 million of our cash and cash equivalents to higher yielding assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 42: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of December 2017 caused the Company to reevaluate the valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets. The decrease in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% decreased the likelihood that we will be able to use a large portion of those deferred tax assets in a future period, so a write-down of $2.7 million was applied to our 2017 Income Statement, as reflected there and in our Statement of Financial Condition.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net income attributable to common stockholders was $8.0 million, or $0.86 per diluted common share. For the year ended December 31, 2016, net income was $13.5 million, or $1.46 per diluted common share. For the year ended December 31, 2015, net income was $11.3 million, or $1.25 per diluted common share.\nThe returns on average assets and average equity for the year ended December 31, 2017, were 0.44% and 6.24%, respectively, compared to 0.77% and 11.22%, respectively, for 2016, and 0.74% and 10.50%, respectively, for 2015.\nThe following are major factors that impacted the Company's results of operations:\nTable 43: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Net interest income increased 8.3% to $79.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $73.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, due to a $6.1 million increase in interest income that was partially offset by an increase of $52 thousand in interest expense. Net interest income increased by 8.1% to $73.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $67.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, due to a $5.7 million increase in interest income that was partially offset by an increase of $249 thousand in interest expense.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 44: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The net interest margin decreased 16 basis points to 4.24% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with 4.39% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in the net interest margin for 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to an eight basis point decrease in the average yields on loans, partially offset by a 23 basis point increase in the average yield on our securities portfolio and a 40 basis point increase in the average yield on our deposits with other financial institutions; the average rates that we paid on deposits decreased by 0.4 basis points. Despite the decrease in the overall average yield of 16 basis points on our total earning assets, higher loan and investment volumes generated higher interest income that more than offset the higher gross amount of interest paid on our customers' deposits.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 45: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The provision for loan losses was $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, $3.6 million higher than the provision during 2016.

The increase in non-interest income in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to increases of $2.5 million in trustee fees, $792 thousand in service charges and fees, $314 thousand in net income from merchant services and a $257 thousand increase in other income, partially offset by an $813 thousand decrease in net cardholder income, and a reduction of $397 thousand in our realized gain on the sale of investment securities. Non-interest income was $13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, $2.9 million more than the $11.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in non-interest income in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to increases of $1.2 million in net income from merchant services, $911 thousand from service charges and fees, $328 thousand in trustee fees, $325 thousand in net gains on investment securities and $265 thousand in other income, partially offset by a reduction of $134 thousand in net income from cardholders.

Non-interest expense was $64.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $59.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of 8.6% was primarily due to an increase of $3.1 million in salaries and employee benefits, an additional $1.3 million in general, administrative and other expenses, and a rise of $807 thousand in equipment and depreciation expense.

The 20.0% increase of net after tax income to $13.6 million in 2016 compared to $11.3 million in 2015 was due to the $5.5 million increase in net interest income and the $2.9 million increase in non-interest income, offset by the $5.1 million increase in non-interest expense and the increase of $1.7 million in income taxes.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following are important factors in understanding our current financial condition and liquidity position:\nTable 50: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Cash, interest-bearing deposits in other banks, and investment securities available-for-sale collectively decreased by $9.6 million (1.2%), to $586.9 million, at December 31, 2017, from $596.5 million at December 31, 2016. This decrease in liquid assets is due to a decrease of $53.8 million in interest bearing deposits in banks, partially offset by a $40.9 million increase in available-for-sale securities and a $3.3 million increase in cash.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 51: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Total assets increased by $44.4 million (2.3%) from $1.92 billion at December 31, 2016, to $1.97 billion at December 31, 2017.

The regulatory well-capitalized guidelines are a minimum of a 5% leverage ratio, a 8% Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, a 10% total risk-based capital ratio, and a 6.5% common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio. The changes in our capital ratios from December 31, 2016, to December 31, 2017, were due to the retention of $4.3 million in earnings during 2017, along with the issuance of common stock in the amount of $1.6 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDeposits\nThe composition and cost of the Bank's deposit base are important in analyzing the Bank's net interest margin and balance sheet liquidity characteristics. The Bank's depositors are generally located in its primary market area. Depending on loan demand and other funding requirements, the Bank also attracts deposits through its interest rate pricing. The Bank monitors all deposits that may be sensitive to interest rate changes to help ensure that liquidity risk does not become excessive due to deposit migration. Deposits at December 31, 2017, were $1.82 billion, compared to $1.78 billion at December 31, 2016. The 2.1% increase was primarily due to the acquisition of additional government and commercial accounts in the Freely Associated States, U.S. government payments for land use and other purposes, and the growth in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands' tourism sector and general economic recovery, partially offset by decreases in the Bank's deposits in the Guam and in the California region.\nThe Bank does not currently accept brokered deposits because it already maintains ample liquidity.\nLiquidity\nOur liquidity position refers to our ability to maintain cash flows sufficient to fund operations and to meet obligations and other commitments in a timely fashion. We believe that the Bank's liquidity position is more than sufficient to meet our operating expenses, borrowing needs and other obligations for 2018, and management has tested and determined that, even under severely stressed scenarios, the Bank's liquidity will be more than adequate to meet our requirements. Our liquidity increased substantially during 2017. Once the increases in our loan portfolio and other assets were accommodated, the increases in our liabilities and equity were channeled into short-term earning assets as a defensive measure due to historically low interest rates and yields, and the possibility that those rates and yields will increase further as the U.S. economy continues to improve. At December 31, 2017, we had $126.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately $159.3 million in available borrowing capacity from various sources, including the Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB\u201d), the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco ( FRB\u201d), and Federal Funds facilities with several financial institutions. The Bank also had $245.9 million in unpledged securities available at December 31, 2017. Our loan-to-deposit ratio increased to 67.7% at December 31, 2017, compared to 66.1% at December 31, 2016, as our gross loans increased by 4.6% and our deposits grew by 2.1%.\nLending\nOur loans originate almost entirely through the branch offices located in our primary market. As the Bank approached a saturation point in our island service area, we expanded our activities in California through our branch in San Francisco. The total loan portfolio remains well diversified with commercial and industrial loans accounting for 20.8% and commercial real estate loans accounting for 45.8% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2017. Construction loans rose from 0.5% of the portfolio at December 31, 2016, to 0.8% at December 31, 2017. Residential mortgages and other consumer-related loans accounted for the remaining 33.3% of total loans at December 31, 2017. The increase in gross loans in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to an increase of 11.2% in our\nconsumer loan portfolio, supplemented by growth of 1.6% in commercial loans. The Bank also had a decrease of $5.5 million in loans sold to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( Freddie Mac\u201d) from $211.0 million at December 31, 2016, to $205.5 million at December 31, 2017, but these loans are off-book, except for the value of the associated mortgage servicing rights. The Bank exercises careful selectivity with respect to the types of loans it chooses to originate.\nNet Interest Income\nThe management of interest income and expense is fundamental to the performance of the Company and the Bank. Net interest income, the difference between interest income and interest expense, is the largest component of the Bank's total revenue. Management closely monitors both total net interest income and the net interest margin (net interest income divided by average earning assets).\nThe Bank, through its asset and liability management policies and practices, as overseen by its Asset and Liability Committee, seeks to maximize net interest income without exposing itself to an excessive level of interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is managed by monitoring the pricing, maturity and repricing options of all classes of interest bearing assets and liabilities. This is discussed in more detail under Liquidity and Asset/Liability Management. In addition, as the market allows, we take measures and initiatives to improve our net interest margin, including increasing loan rates, maintaining interest rate floors on floating rate loans, reducing nonperforming assets, managing deposit interest rates and reducing higher-cost deposits.\nFrom January 22, 2008, through December 16, 2008, the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee reduced its target short-term interest rates by 325 basis points, to a range of 0.00% to 0.25%, in response to the credit crisis and economic downturn that resulted from the collapse in the U.S. housing market and the subsequent global recession. The target Federal Funds Rate was raised to a range of 0.25% to 0.50% on December 16, 2015, then again to a range of 0.50% to 0.75% on December 15, 2016. During 2017, the target Federal Funds Rate was increased by 25 basis points three times, on March 15, June 14 and December 13, ending in a target range from 1.25% to 1.50%. The increase in short-term rates will gradually affect the rates applicable to many of the Bank's loans. The increase in short-term interest rates raised the overall cost of interest bearing deposits, which represent the Bank's primary funding source, by 11.0% by the end of 2017, as they tend to re-price more slowly than floating rate loans. The continuing low level of short-term interest rates, including the prime rate, has significantly compressed the Bank's net interest margin, but that pressure is gradually being eased.\nManagement of Credit Risk\nWe continue to proactively identify, quantify and manage our problem loans. Early identification of problem loans and potential future losses helps enable us to resolve credit issues with potentially less risk and lower ultimate losses. We maintain an allowance for loan losses in an amount that we believe is adequate to absorb probable and projected incurred losses in the portfolio. While we strive to carefully monitor and manage credit quality and to identify loans that may be deteriorating, circumstances can change at any time that may result in future losses for loans included in the portfolio, that as of the date of the financial statements have not yet been identified as potential problem loans. Through established credit practices, we adjust the allowance for loan losses accordingly. However, because future events are uncertain, there may be loans that deteriorate, some of which could occur in an accelerated time frame. As a result, future additions to the allowance may be necessary. Because the loan portfolio contains a number of commercial loans, commercial real estate and construction loans with relatively large balances, deterioration in the credit quality of one or more of these loans may require a significant increase to the allowance for loan losses. Future additions to the allowance may also be required based on changes in the financial condition of borrowers, such as have resulted due to changing economic conditions. Additionally, federal and local banking regulators throughout our market area, as an integral part of their supervisory function, periodically review our allowance for loan losses. These regulatory agencies may require us to recognize further loan loss provisions or charge-offs based upon their judgments, which may be different from ours. Any increase in the allowance for loan losses may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.\nWe also maintain a reserve against potential credit risks associated with our unfunded off-balance sheet loan commitments.\nFurther discussion of the management of credit risk appears under Provision for Loan Losses\u201d and Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d.\nNon-Interest Income\nWhile net interest income remains the largest single component of total revenues, non-interest income is an important source, as well. In total, the Bank received $16.6 million in non-interest income during 2017, an increase of $2.7 million from the $13.9 million recorded for 2016, and $5.6 million more than the $11.0 million received in 2015. The increase from 2016 to 2017 was due in part to a $2.5 million increase in trustee fees, an increase of $792 thousand in service charges and fees, and a $314 thousand increase in net income from merchant services, partially offset by an $813 thousand decrease in net cardholders income, along with a $397 thousand\ndrop in our gains from the sale of investment securities. The increase in trustee fees was substantially based on the recovery of certain investment fees, the higher service charges and fees primarily came from a charge implemented against low-balance accounts and the institution of a fee for paper account statements, and the increase in merchant services income resulted from the growth of the portfolio and a decrease in cross-border fees, while the decrease in cardholders income resulted in part from the increase in fees and the lower gain on the sale of securities was caused by market price fluctuations.\nNon-Interest Expense\nManagement considers the control of operating expenses to be a critical element of the performance of the Company and the Bank. As in years past, the Bank has undertaken initiatives to contain its non-interest expense and improve its efficiency. Nevertheless, total non-interest expense was $70.4 million for year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $64.1 million for year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $6.2 million. This increase was largely the result of increasing costs associated with salaries and employee benefits, from $31.6 million in 2016 to $34.2 million in 2017, the rise in equipment and depreciation expense and higher general, administrative and other expenses, which increased by $1.7 million and $1.0 million, respectively. Operating expenses in 2016 were $5.1 million higher than in 2015, primarily due to increasing costs associated with salaries and employee benefits, from $28.5 million in 2015 to $31.6 million in 2016, higher general administrative and other expenses and the rise in equipment and depreciation expense, which increased by $1.3 million and $807 thousand, respectively. For both 2016 and 2017, the increases in operating expenses were primarily the result of organic growth in the size of the Bank.\nCapital Management\nAs part of its asset and liability management process, the Company continually assesses its capital position to take into consideration growth, expected earnings, risk profile and potential corporate activities that it may choose to pursue.\nDuring the past several years, the Bank's principal source of increases in capital has been retained earnings, supplemented by stock purchases through our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report for a description of the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Since the formation of the Company in 2011, though, the Bank's assets have grown by 78.2%, and those more traditional sources of additional capital have not kept pace.\nAlthough the Bank remains well capitalized\u201d by all four regulatory measures of capital adequacy, the Bank's Tier 1 ratio had been decreasing because of its rapid asset growth, primarily attributed to the substantial growth in customer deposits. Consequently, the Company placed an additional $2.8 million of its common stock as of December 31, 2015, placed $9.8 million in non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock during 2016 and offered up to an additional $20.0 million in common stock at a purchase price of $12.25 per common share commencing September 29, 2017. Of this latest offering, $1.3 million had been placed as of December 31, 2017.\nIn the 2015 and 2016 offerings, the Company issued its stock to certain \"accredited investors\" within the meaning of Rule 501 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), at a purchase price of $9.85 per common share in 2015 and a purchase price of $1,000.00 per preferred share in 2016 (the \"Offerings\"). These are restricted shares, which may not be resold for a period of two years. The terms of the offerings were set forth in their respective Stock Purchase Agreements, dated July 30, 2015, and September 28, 2016, entered into between the Company and each investor. A portion of the proceeds from the offerings was used to retire subordinated debt, while the remainder will allow the Company to support the continued organic growth of its banking subsidiary in its existing market areas and will enable us to further serve the needs of individuals and businesses in those markets.\nThe Company's common and preferred stock was offered and sold only to investors that met the \"accredited investor\" definition of Rule 501 of the Securities Act in reliance on the exemption from registration afforded under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and Rule 504 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. The common stock offered in the Offerings has not been registered under the Securities Act or state securities laws, and may not be offered or sold in the United States without being registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") or through an applicable exemption from SEC registration requirements.\nResults of Operations\nThe Bank earns income from two primary sources. The first is net interest income, which is interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities. The second is non-interest income, which primarily consists of service charges and fees, income from merchants for processing credit and debit card transactions, non-interest income from holders of the Bank's credit cards, trustee fees and net investment securities gains. The majority of the Company's non-interest expenses are operating costs that relate to providing a full range of banking services to our customers.\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\nThe level of net interest income depends on several factors in combination, including earning assets, yields on earning assets, the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, and the relative volumes of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. To maintain its net interest margin, the Bank must manage the relationship between interest earned and interest paid.\nDistribution, Rate and Yield\nThe following Distribution, Rate and Yield table presents the average amounts outstanding during 2017 and 2016 for the major categories of the Company's balance sheet, the average interest rates earned or paid thereon, and the resulting net interest margin on average interest earning assets for the periods indicated. Average balances are based on monthly averages.\nTable 59: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

</tr>\n</table>\nThe Distribution, Rate and Yield table above sets forth the dollar amounts in interest earned and paid for each major category of interest earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for the noted periods, as well as their respective yields and costs, and the resulting interest rate spreads and net interest margins.\nThe Bank's net interest margin, expressed as a percentage of average earning assets, was 4.24% for 2017, down 15 basis points from 4.39% for 2016, even though average earning assets increased by 12.0% during the year, from $1.67 billion in 2016 to $1.87 billion in 2017. The primary reason for the decrease in the net interest margin was that our funding cost increased by 11.0%, from $2.0 million in 2016 to $2.2 million in 2017. Our average loan balances increased by $57.8 million, or 5.1%, but the average yield on the entire loan portfolio decreased by 9 basis points so that interest earnings on loans increased by only $2.5 million, or 3.6%. New loans made in a more competitive environment caused the decrease in the average yield on the loan portfolio. Yields on our investment securities portfolio increased by 23 basis points and the yield on short term investments went up by 40 basis points, but the yield on average earning assets decreased from 4.52% to 4.36% from 2016 to 2017. Average total interest-bearing liabilities increased by 13.5% during 2017, to $1.31 billion from $1.15 billion the previous year.\nNet interest income for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased by $5.9 million, to $79.5 million, compared to $73.4 million a year earlier, primarily due to an increase in interest income derived from the growth in our investment securities portfolio, supplemented by increases in earnings on average loan balances and our short term deposits in other banks, including the Federal\nReserve Bank of San Francisco. Net interest income for 2016 increased by $5.5 million from 2015, due to an increase of $5.7 million in interest income derived from the growth in average loan balances, a higher average investment portfolio and an increase in our average deposits with other banks, only slightly offset by an increase of $249 thousand in the interest that we paid on average deposit balances and other borrowed funds. The Bank's net interest margin was 4.40% in 2016, compared to 4.66% in 2015, a decrease of 26 basis points.\nA substantial portion of the Bank's earning assets are variable-rate loans that re-price when the Bank's reference rate, which usually corresponds with the New York prime lending rate, is changed. This is in contrast to a large base of core deposits that are generally slower to re-price. This causes the Bank's balance sheet to be liability-sensitive, which means that, all else being equal, net interest margin will be lower during periods when short-term interest rates are rising and higher when rates are falling. However, we will not necessarily have to raise rates on the personal savings portion of our core deposits as general market interest rates increase, mitigating the sensitivity of our net interest margin to rising interest rates.\nThe following table provides information regarding the changes in interest income and interest expense, attributable to changes in rates and changes in volumes that contribute to the total change in net interest income for the years ending December 31, 2017 and 2016. Variances attributable to both rate and volume changes are equal to the change in rate times the change in average balance and are included below in the average volume column.\nTable 63: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Attributable to:\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net Change in\nInterest\nIncome/Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change in\nRate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change in Volume\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Short term investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment Securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (963\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,635\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest-bearing checking accounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Money market and savings accounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (44\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Certificates of deposit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other borrowings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (165\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (165\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (31\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,604\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,686\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProvision for Loan Losses\nCredit risk is inherent in the lending business. The Bank establishes an allowance for loan losses through charges to earnings, which are shown in the statements of income as the provision for loan losses. Specifically identifiable and quantifiable known losses are promptly charged off against the allowance. The provision for loan losses is allocated monthly and evaluated quarterly through a determination of the adequacy of the Bank's allowance for loan losses, and reset if necessary, charging the shortfall, if any, to the current quarter's expense. This has the effect of creating variability in the amount and frequency of charges to the Bank's earnings. The provision for loan losses and level of allowance for each period are dependent upon many factors, including loan growth, net charge-offs, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio, delinquencies, management's assessment of the quality of the loan portfolio, the valuation of problem loans and the general economic conditions in the Bank's market area.\nFor 2017, the Bank had a provision for loan and credit losses of $7.5 million, which included $6 thousand assigned to the reserve for unfunded credit commitments. The remaining 2017 provision was $3.6 million more than the provision for 2016, and higher than the provision of $4.5 million for 2015. The 2017 provision was increased to reflect the growth of $53.9 million in our loan portfolio as our emphasis shifted moderately from commercial to consumer loans, and is deemed by management to provide a sufficient allowance for loan losses due to net losses of $5.7 million during the year, as well as to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that is adequate to absorb all reasonably expected future losses and to express management's perception of risk in the existing loan portfolio, as well as changes in the quality of that portfolio. The 2016 provision for loan losses decreased by $600 thousand compared to the $4.5 million provision during 2015.\nThe allowance for loan losses represented 1.40%, 1.31% and 1.44% of total gross loans at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operating income to bring the allowance for loan losses to a level deemed appropriate by the Bank based on the factors discussed under Allowance for Loan Losses.\u201d\nNon-interest income\nThe following table sets forth the various components of the Company's non-interest income:\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase (decrease) 2017\nversus 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase (decrease) 2016\nversus 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service charges and fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,616\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,824\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment securities gains (losses), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (397\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -99.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 427.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income from merchant services, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,108\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,205\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 133.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income from cardholders, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,754\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (813\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -46.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (134\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -7.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Trustee fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,518\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 276.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 56.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,671\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,992\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal non-interest income in 2017 was $2.7 million, or 19.2%, higher than in 2016, primarily because of increases of $2.5 million in trustee fees, $792 thousand in service charges and fees, $314 thousand in net income from merchant services and $257 thousand in other income, in part due to the implementation of a nominal fee for mailed paper account statements and in part to organic growth. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $813 thousand in net income from cardholders due to an increase in fees and a decline of $397 thousand in net gains on the sale of securities because of a less favorable interest rate environment. Other sources of non-interest income include loan servicing fees and income from the Bank-owned life insurance policies. The proportional composition of non-interest income remained relatively stable, with the increase in trustee fees and the decrease in net income from cardholders being the only changes exceeding 5.0% of the respective year's total from 2016 to 2017. Total non-interest income in 2016 was $2.9 million higher than in 2015, primarily because of a sharp increase of $1.2 million, or 133.4%, in income from merchant services due to the correction of accumulated billing errors by a vendor, the on-boarding of new merchant customers subsequent to the closure of a competing merchant services provider in Guam and an increase in net residuals that resulted from a reduction in cross-border fees; an increase of $911 thousand in service charges and fees that resulted from the full implementation of a fee to offset the costs of low-balance savings accounts; an increase of $328 thousand in trustee fees generated by increased revenue sharing in the higher interest rate environment; and a $325 thousand increase in net gains on the sale of investment securities.\nNon-interest expense\nThe following table sets forth the various components of the Company's non-interest expense:\nTable 65: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years

December 31, 2017, an increase of $6.2 million from $64.1 million in 2016. This increase is primarily attributed to the $2.6 million increase in salaries & employee benefits, up by 8.1% from the year ended December 31, 2016, due to merit raises and increases in some benefits expenses, as well as an increase in the number of employees necessary to accommodate the expansion and restructuring of the Bank's operations. In addition, our equipment and depreciation expense increased by $1.7 million, primarily due to the implementation of new technologies and increased information security expenses; general, administrative and other expenses increased by $1.0 million, and occupancy expense rose by $400 thousand.\nIn 2016, total non-interest expense increased by $5.1 million to $64.1 million, as compared to $59.0 million in 2015. This increase is primarily attributed to the $3.1 million increase in salaries & employee benefits, up by 11.0% from the year ended December 31, 2016, due to merit raises and increases in some benefits expenses, as well as an increase in the number of employees necessary to accommodate the expansion of the Bank's operations. In addition, general, administrative and other expenses increased by $1.3 million and our equipment and depreciation expense increased by $807 thousand. These increases were partially offset by modest decreases in the expenses associated with other real estate that is owned by the Bank, occupancy expense and contract services expense.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe Company computes its provision for income taxes on a monthly basis. The effective tax rate is determined by applying the Bank's statutory income tax rate to pre-tax book income, as adjusted for permanent differences between pre-tax book income and actual taxable income. These permanent differences include, but are not limited to, tax-exempt interest income, increases in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies, certain expenses that are not allowed as tax deductions, and tax credits.\nThe Bank pays income taxes in Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands under a territorial mirror\u201d of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, with payments made to the respective territorial governments instead of the U.S. Treasury; there is no equivalent of a state income tax in either of these jurisdictions. The Bank also pays taxes to the governments of the Republic of Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the State of California. The Bank's territorial and state income tax expense in 2017 was $9.6 million, as compared to an income tax expense of $5.7 million in 2016 and $4.1 million in 2015. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to a change in the valuation allowance for our deferred tax asset that resulted from the reduction in the maximum corporate income tax rate under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which became law on December 22, 2017, and which was only partially offset by the reduction in our net income before taxes.\nThe difference in the effective tax rate compared to the combined territorial, foreign and state statutory tax rate of 35% still in effect for 2017 is primarily the result of the Bank's portfolio of tax-exempt loans to the government of Guam totaling $25.9 million and $30.3 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nSome items of income and expense are recognized in different years for tax purposes than when applying generally accepted accounting principles, leading to timing differences between the Bank's actual tax liability and the amount accrued for this liability based on book income. These temporary differences comprise the deferred\u201d portion of the Bank's tax expense or benefit, which is accumulated on the Bank's books as a deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability until such time as they reverse. At the end of 2017 and 2016, the Bank had a gross deferred tax asset of $7.4 million and $11.3 million, respectively.\nRealization of the net deferred tax asset is primarily dependent upon the Bank generating sufficient taxable income to obtain a benefit from the reversal of net deductible temporary differences, utilization of tax credit carry-forwards and the net operating loss carry-forwards for Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and California state income tax purposes. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods based on estimates of future taxable income. Under generally accepted accounting principles, a valuation allowance is required to be recognized if it is more likely than not\u201d that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The determination of whether the deferred tax assets will actually be realized is highly subjective and dependent upon judgment concerning management's evaluation of both positive and negative evidence, including forecasts of future income, cumulative losses, applicable tax planning strategies, and assessments of current and future economic and business conditions.\nIn assessing the realization of deferred tax assets at December 31, 2017, based on these factors, the Bank believed that it was more likely than not that the Bank will realize only $5.5 million of the benefits of these deductible differences. Therefore, a valuation allowance of $2.0 million for its deferred tax asset was recorded at December 31, 2017.\nIn assessing the realization of deferred tax assets at December 31, 2016, the Bank believed that it was more likely than not that the Bank would realize only $8.1 million of the benefits of these deductible differences. Therefore, a valuation allowance of $3.2 million for the deferred tax asset was recorded at December 31, 2016.\nFinancial Condition\nAs of December 31, 2017, total assets were $1.97 billion, an increase of 2.3% from $1.92 billion at December 31, 2016. Total securities available-for-sale (at fair value) were $460.8 million, an increase of 9.7% from $419.9 million at December 31, 2016. The total loan portfolio, net of allowance for loan losses and deferred fees, was $1.21 billion, an increase of 4.5% from $1.16 billion at year-end 2016. Interest bearing deposits in banks were reduced by more than one third during 2017, falling to $97.1 million from $150.9 million at the end of 2016. Total deposits were $1.82 billion, an increase of 2.1% from $1.78 billion at year-end 2016. The Bank had no short-term borrowings at December 31, 2017.\nSecurities Portfolio\nThe following table reflects the estimated fair value of Available-for-Sale securities and the amortized cost of

earning assets, and the structure and composition of this portfolio is important to an analysis of the financial condition of the Bank and the Company. The portfolio serves the following\npurposes: (i) it provides a source of pledged assets for securing certain deposits and borrowed funds, as may be required by law or by specific agreement with a depositor or lender; (ii) it can be used as an interest rate risk management tool, since it provides a large base of assets, the maturity and interest rate characteristics of which can be changed more readily than the loan portfolio to better match changes in the deposit base and other funding sources of the Bank; and (iii) it is an alternative interest earning use of funds when loan demand is weak or when deposits grow more rapidly than loans.\nEighty-four percent of the Bank's securities at December 31, 2017, were classified under existing accounting rules as Available-for-Sale\u201d to allow flexibility in the management of the portfolio. Accounting guidance requires Available-for-Sale securities to be marked to fair market value, with an offset to other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders' equity, recorded on a quarterly basis. The remaining 16.3% of the investment portfolio was in Held-to-Maturity securities, which the Bank is willing and believes it will be able to retain until they mature, and which are recorded on an amortized cost basis.\nThe Bank's portfolio has historically been comprised primarily of: (i) U.S. government agency and sponsored entities' debt securities for liquidity and pledging; (ii) U.S. government agency and sponsored entities' mortgage-backed securities, which in many instances can also be used for pledging, and which generally enhance the yield of the portfolio; and (iii) U.S. government agency pool securities, which generally enhance the yield of the portfolio. Since the downgrade of many municipal obligations and their respective insurers in the past few years, the Bank no longer holds municipal bonds, but may do so again when markets become more stable.\nCompared to December 31, 2016, the Bank's securities portfolio increased by $34.4 million to 28.0% of total assets at December 31, 2017, from 26.9% at December 31, 2016. The Bank increased its holding of mortgage-back securities by $11.2 million to $107.2 million at December 31, 2017, from $96.0 million at December 31, 2016. During the same period, the Bank's holdings of U.S. government agency pool securities increased by $43.4 million, to $294.1 million, and its holdings of U.S. government agency and sponsored enterprise debt securities decreased by $20.1 million, to $149.2 million. The Bank has not used interest rate swaps or other derivative instruments to hedge fixed rate loans or securities to otherwise mitigate interest rate risk.\nLoans\nThe Bank's loans represent the largest portion of earning assets, substantially greater than the securities portfolio or any other asset category, and the quality and diversification of the loan portfolio is an important consideration when assessing the financial condition of the Bank and the Company.\nGross loans represented 62.6% of total assets at December 31, 2017, as compared to 61.2% at December 31, 2016. The ratio of gross loans to deposits increased to 67.7% at the end of 2017 from 66.1% at the end of 2016. Demand for loans has strengthened within the Bank's California, Freely Associated States and Northern Mariana Islands markets due to the improving economic environment, but the Bank has remained selective with respect to the types of loans it chooses to originate.\nThe Loan Distribution table that follows sets forth the Bank's gross loans outstanding, deferred fee income amortized over the life of some loans, the allowance for loan losses and the percentage distribution in each loan category at the dates indicated.\nLoan Portfolio\nTable 69: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>

loan portfolio is concentrated in commercial loans (which include loans to governments), primarily in commercial real estate, hotels and gas stations, with the balance in working capital and equipment financing. These are followed by other consumer loans and residential mortgages. The increase in the Bank's loan portfolio in 2017 was due to customary loan activity throughout our markets, the addition of several significant commercial loans in both the San Francisco and Guam regions, and consumer loan promotions. The Bank's gross loans were concentrated in Guam and San Francisco, at 87.8% of our net loan portfolio as of December 31, 2017, compared to 87.1% as of December 31, 2016. The only industry concentration that was considered significant at December 31, 2017, was within our commercial mortgage loan portfolio, which at 45.0% of total gross loans constituted a lower proportion than the 47.0% of total loans at the end of 2016.\nThe Bank's commercial & industrial loans are made for working capital, financing the purchase of equipment and other business purposes. Commercial loans include loans with maturities ranging from thirty days to one year and term loans\u201d with maturities normally ranging from three to ten years. Short- term business loans are generally intended to finance current transactions and typically provide for periodic principal payments, with interest payable monthly. Term loans normally carry floating interest rates, with monthly payments of both principal and interest, but may be amortized over a longer period than the term of the loan, with a balloon payment at the end of the term.\nThe Bank is an active participant in the Small Business Administration (SBA), State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI), Nor-Cal Financial Development Corp. and U.S. Department of Agriculture guaranteed lending programs, and has been approved by the SBA as a lender under the Preferred and Patriot Express Lender Programs. The Bank regularly makes such guaranteed loans and is frequently recognized as the largest originator of SBA loans in Guam, with an outstanding volume of $6.5 million at December 31, 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2017, commercial and residential real estate loans of $702.5 million consist primarily of adjustable and fixed rate loans secured by deeds of trust or mortgages on commercial and residential property, and comprised 57.1% of the total loan portfolio. The Bank's commercial mortgages at December 31, 2017, consist of $553.1 million, or 45.0% of gross loans. Commercial construction loans comprise $10.2 million, or 0.8%, of gross loans. Residential mortgages, including home equity loans, were $138.5 million, or 11.3%, of gross loans. Properties securing the commercial and residential real estate loans are located in the Bank's primary markets, which include the San Francisco Bay area.\nThe Bank's commercial real estate loans consist primarily of loans based on the borrower's cash flow and are secured by deeds of trust or mortgages on commercial and residential property to provide a secondary source of repayment. The Bank generally restricts commercial real estate term loans to no more than the lower of 75% of the property's appraised value or the purchase price of the property during the initial underwriting of the credit, depending on the type of property and its utilization. The Bank offers both fixed\nand floating rate loans. Maturities on commercial real estate loans are generally five years (with amortization up to twenty-five years and a balloon payment due at maturity), and maturities on residential mortgage loans are typically between 15 and 30 years, with many of those loans sold to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation with the retention of servicing rights. SBA and certain other real estate loans that can be sold in the secondary market may be granted for longer maturities.\nThe Bank's construction loans primarily finance the development and construction of commercial and residential properties. The Bank uses underwriting guidelines to assess the likelihood of repayment from sources such as sale of the property or availability of permanent mortgage financing prior to making the construction loan. Construction loans increased by $3.7 million to $10.2 million at December 31, 2017, from $6.4 million at December 31, 2016.\nAdditionally, the Bank makes consumer loans for the purpose of financing automobiles, various types of consumer goods, and other personal purposes. Consumer loans generally provide for the monthly payment of principal and interest. Most of the Bank's consumer loans are either unsecured, secured by the personal property being purchased or, in the case of home equity loans, real property.\nAt December 31, 2017, total gross loans increased by $53.9 million, or 4.6%, to $1.23 billion from $1.18 billion at December 31, 2016. The increase in loans was largely attributed to a $41.4 million increase in consumer loans to $409.9 million at December 31, 2017, from $368.5 million at December 31, 2016. This was primarily due to the rapid growth in other consumer loans, consisting of revolving and installment credit and overdrafts, which was the result a pre-approved loan campaign and holiday loan promotions. The increase was partially offset by a $6.0 million decrease in residential mortgages and a $308 thousand decline in automobile loans. Commercial loans increased by $12.5 million during 2017, from $807.5 million to $820.0 million, due to the $8.0 million increase in commercial & industrial loans, a $3.7 million rise in commercial construction loans, and the $853 thousand increase in commercial mortgage loans, all only slightly offset by the decrease of $31 thousand in the commercial agriculture loan category.\nAt December 31, 2017, loans outstanding were comprised of approximately 65.0% variable rate loans and 35.0% fixed rate loans.\nSince it first opened in 1972, the Bank has expanded its operations and its branch network, first in Guam, then in the other islands of our region and in San Francisco, California. In the interests of enhancing performance and stability through market and industry diversification, the Bank has increased its focus on growth in the San Francisco area in recent years, adding personnel with experience and expertise in the Bay Area. The following table provides figures for gross loans in the Bank's administrative regions for the years ending December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017:\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> At December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Guam\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 681,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 720,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 704,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 73,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 75,658\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 79,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> The Freely Associated States of Micronesia *\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 57,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 76,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 93,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> California\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 258,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 303,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 352,165\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,070,588\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,176,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,229,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td> *\n</td> <td> The Freely Associated States are comprised of the Federated States of Micronesia (Chuuk, Kosrae, Pohnpei and Yap), the Republic of Palau and the Republic of the Marshall Islands.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe figures for 2015 and 2016 above have been updated from previous Annual Reports on Form 10-K to reflect their gross instead of their net amounts.\nAs the table indicates, the Bank's total gross loans increased by 4.6% during 2017 and by 9.8% during 2016. Total loans in California increased by $48.6 million, or 16.0%, accounting for 90.3% of total portfolio growth during 2017. Loan growth in the Freely Associated States of Micronesia was second, with growth at $17.2 million, or 32.0% of total loan growth, and outstanding loans in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands grew by $3.8 million, or 5.1% of total growth, whereas outstanding loan balances in Guam decreased by $15.8 million, primarily due to the repayment of a single, large commercial loan during the year. For the two years ended December 31, 2017, California accounted for 58.6% of total loan growth, while the Freely Associated States contributed 22.7%, Guam accounted for 14.8% and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands provided 3.9% of total gross loan portfolio growth during that two-year period. The economy in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands has been recovering at a more rapid pace, but loan growth there has not yet caught up.\nLoan Maturities\nThe following table presents the maturity distribution of the Bank's loans as of December 31, 2017. The table also shows the distribution of such loans between those with predetermined (fixed) interest rates and those with variable (floating) interest rates.\nFloating rates generally fluctuate with changes in the New York prime rate, as reflected in The Wall Street Journal, and the Bank of Guam prime rate.\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> At December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Due in Less\nThan 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Due in More Than\n1 Year But Less\nThan 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Due in More\nThan 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Non-Accrual\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 116,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 276,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 419,978\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 820,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Residential Mortgages\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,551\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 118,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 138,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer Loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 186,689\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 57,558\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 271,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 145,767\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 474,969\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 595,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,229,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Variable rate loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 101,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 211,874\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 477,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,222\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 799,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fixed rate loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 263,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 118,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,131\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 430,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 145,767\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 474,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 595,792\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,229,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoan Servicing\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, there were $205.5 million and $211.0 million, respectively, in Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation loans that were serviced by the Bank.\nLoan servicing rights are included in Accrued Interest Receivable and Other Assets on the consolidated balance sheets, and are reported at their estimated fair value.\nNonperforming Assets\nFinancial institutions generally have a certain level of exposure to credit quality risk, and could potentially receive less than a full return of principal and interest if a debtor becomes unable or unwilling to repay. Since loans are the most significant assets of the Bank and generate the largest portion of its revenues, the Bank's management of credit risk is focused primarily on loan quality.\nBanks have generally suffered their most severe earnings declines as a result of customers' inability to generate sufficient cash flow to service their debts, and/or downturns in national and regional economies and declines in overall asset values, including real estate prices.\nThe Bank's credit policies identify allowable geographic credit concentrations. In addition, these policies establish the Bank's underwriting standards and the methods of monitoring credit quality on an ongoing basis. The Bank's internal credit risk controls are focused on underwriting practices, credit originating procedures, training, risk management techniques, and familiarity with loan customers, as well as the relative diversity and geographic concentration of our loan portfolio.\nThe Bank's credit risk may also be affected by external factors, such as the level of interest rates, employment, general economic conditions, real estate values, and trends in particular industries or geographic markets. As an independent community bank serving a specific geographic area, the Bank must contend with the unpredictable changes in the general regional market and, particularly, primary local markets. The Bank's asset quality has been affected in the past by the impact of national and regional recessions, consumer bankruptcies, and depressed real estate values.\nNonperforming assets are comprised of the following: loans for which the Bank is no longer accruing interest; restructured loans that are more than 90 days past due; loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest (although they are generally placed on non-accrual when they become 90 days past due, unless they are both well-secured and in the process of revision or collection); and other real estate owned ( OREO\u201d) that is acquired through foreclosures. Management's classification of a loan as non-accrual\u201d is an indication that there is reasonable doubt as to the full recovery of principal or interest on the loan. At that point, the Bank stops accruing interest income, and reverses any uncollected interest that had previously been accrued. These loans may or may not be collateralized, and collection efforts are pursued. The Bank begins recognizing interest income again only as cash interest payments are received and it has been determined that the collection of all outstanding principal is no longer in doubt. Loans may be restructured by management when a borrower has experienced some change in financial status causing an inability to meet the original repayment terms and where the Bank believes the borrower will eventually overcome those circumstances and make full repayment. OREO consists of properties acquired by foreclosure or similar means that management is offering or will offer for sale. Total OREO, net of OREO reserves, was $2.4 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $2.7 million at December 31, 2016.\nNonperforming Assets\nThe following table provides information about nonperforming assets by asset type as of December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Nonperforming Assets:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-accrual loans past due 30 days or more\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,179\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,927\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans past due 90 days or more still accruing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,946\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restructured loans past due 30 days - not included above\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other Real Estate Owned, gross\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,466\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,746\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Nonperforming Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,555\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table provides information about nonperforming loans by loan type:\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Nonperforming Loans:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial & industrial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial mortgage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial construction\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial agriculture\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total commercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Residential mortgage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Home equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Automobile\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other consumer 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total consumer\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,999\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total nonperforming loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,809\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Comprised of other revolving and installment credit and overdrafts.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe Bank maintains its allowance for loan losses at a level which, in management's judgment, is adequate to absorb prospective credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The amount of the allowance is based on management's evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio, including the nature and volume of the portfolio, credit concentrations, trends in historical loss experience, the level of certain classified and impaired loans, and economic conditions, along with their related impacts on specific borrowers and industry groups. The allowance is increased by provisions for loan losses, which are charged against earnings, and reduced by charge-offs, net of recoveries. Because of uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, management's estimate of potential credit losses in the loan portfolio and the related allowance may change from time to time.\nThe Bank's allowance for loan losses increased by $1.8 million to $17.3 million during 2017 from $15.4 million at the end of 2016. The increase in the allowance for loan losses in 2017 was based primarily on the growth in our loan portfolio, particularly in consumer loans, and management's periodic reevaluation of the overall portfolio's inherent risk. The Bank had $7.3 million in charge-offs in 2017, which were partially offset by loan recoveries of $1.6 million.\nNet loans charged-off includes the realization of losses in the portfolio that were partially recognized previously through provisions for loan losses and write-downs of loan principal valuations. Net charge-offs were $5.7 million in 2017, more than double the net charge-offs of $2.6 million in 2016. The 2017 net was higher primarily due to higher charge-offs in the consumer loan portfolio. Historical net loan charge-offs are not necessarily indicative of the amount of net charge-offs that the Bank will realize in the future.\nThe table in Note 6 - Loans, under Credit Quality Indicators, provides a summary of the allocation of the allowance for loan losses for specific categories at the dates indicated. The allocation presented should not be interpreted as an indication that charges to the allowance for loan losses will be incurred in these amounts or proportions, or that the portion of the allowance allocated to each category represents the total amount available for charge-offs that may occur within these categories.\nAllocation of Loan Loss Allowance\nThe material set forth in Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K is incorporated by reference.\nDeposits\nThe composition and cost of the Bank's deposit base are important components in analyzing the Bank's net interest margin and balance sheet liquidity characteristics, both of which are discussed in greater detail in other sections in this report. The Bank's liquidity is impacted by the volatility of deposits or other funding instruments or, in other words, by the propensity of that money to leave the institution for interest rate-related or other reasons. Deposits can be adversely affected if economic conditions in the Bank's market area weaken. Potentially, the most volatile deposits in a financial institution are jumbo certificates of deposit, meaning time deposits with balances that equal or exceed $250,000, as customers with balances of that magnitude are typically more rate-sensitive than customers with smaller balances.\nThe following table summarizes the distribution of deposits for the periods indicated:\nTable 77: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-interest bearing deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 508,149\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 469,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest bearing deposits:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Demand deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 288,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 346,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Regular savings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 713,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 669,957\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Time deposits:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $250,000 or more\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,528\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33,697\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less than $250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,832\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other interest bearing deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 264,844\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 234,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total interest bearing deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,307,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,309,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,816,132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,778,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Bank gathers deposits from among the communities it serves. The Bank's business is not generally seasonal in nature, and the Bank is not primarily dependent upon funds from sources outside the United States of America, but approximately 27.1% of its deposit base at December 31, 2017, is acquired in the Micronesian islands that are politically organized in free association with the United States and use the U.S. dollar as their currency. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, 35.1% and 34.1% of deposits were from domestic and foreign government sources.\nNon-interest and low interest-bearing demand deposits decreased by $19.2 million, or 2.4%, to $797.1 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $816.4 million at December 31, 2016. Other interest bearing deposits, which are comprised of time deposit open accounts, increased by $30.6 million, or 13.1%, to $264.8 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $234.3 million at December 31, 2016.\nAs mentioned earlier, the Bank has expanded its operations and its branch network since it first opened in 1972, first in Guam, then in the other islands of our region and in San Francisco, California. As time has passed, the Bank has gathered market share in each of the islands. In recent years, in order to diversify its geographic market, the Bank has increased its focus on growth in the San Francisco area. The following table provides figures for deposits in the Bank's administrative regions for the years ending December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017:\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> At December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Guam\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 824,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 975,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 936,237\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 234,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 319,895\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 343,149\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> The Freely Associated States of Micronesia *\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 314,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 431,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 491,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> California\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 49,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 51,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,422,671\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,778,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,816,132\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 79: <table> <tr> <td> *\n</td> <td> The Freely Associated States are comprised of the Federated States of Micronesia (Chuuk, Kosrae, Pohnpei and Yap), the Republic of Palau and the Republic of the Marshall Islands.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2017, deposits increased by a total of $37.5 million, of which $59.4 million was in the Bank's Freely Associated States branches and $23.3 million was in our Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands branches, but decreased in our Guam branches by $39.3million and in California by $5.9 million. Overall, the Bank's deposit base increased by 2.1% during 2017, after rising by 25.0% during 2016. Deposits decreased in the California region by 11.5% in the year ended December 31, 2017, after increasing by 4.7% the previous year as a reversal of gradual, moderate growth in that market.\nDeposit Maturity Distribution\nAt December 31, 2017, the scheduled maturities of time deposits were as follows:\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td> Years ending December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 35,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2022 and thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 40,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Bank provides and services government and business deposit accounts that are frequently more than $250,000 in average balance per account. The account activity for some account types and client types necessitates appropriate liquidity management practices by the Bank to ensure its ability to fund withdrawals.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn the normal course of business, the Bank makes commitments to extend credit to its customers as long as there are no violations of any conditions established in the associated contractual arrangements. These commitments are obligations that represent a potential credit risk to the Bank, yet are not reflected in any form within the Company's consolidated balance sheets other than in a modest contingency reserve against those commitments. Total unused commitments to extend credit were $159.8 million at December 31, 2017, as compared to $152.6 million at December 31, 2016. Unused commitments represented 13.0% of outstanding gross loans at both December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nThe effect on the Bank's revenues, expenses, cash flows and liquidity from the unused portion of the commitments to provide credit cannot be reasonably predicted, because there is no certainty that these lines of credit will ever be fully utilized, if at all. For more information regarding the Company's off-balance sheet arrangements, see Note 16 to the financial statements located elsewhere herein.\nThe following table presents the Bank's commitments to extend credit for the periods indicated:\nTable 81: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commitments to extend credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 159,767\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 152,585\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Letters of credit:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Standby letters of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 54,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 52,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial letters of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,601\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 57,308\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 55,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nContractual Obligations\nThe Bank utilizes facilities, equipment and land under various operating leases with original terms ranging from 1 to 99 years. Some of these leases include scheduled rent increases. The total amount of the rent is being expensed on the straight-line method over the lease terms. The Bank has recorded a deferred obligation of $988 thousand and $926 thousand as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which has been included within other liabilities, to reflect the excess of rent expense over cash paid on the leases.\nAt December 31, 2017, annual lease commitments under the above noncancelable operating leases were as follows:\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td> Years ending December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,797\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,712\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,351\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2022 and Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 28,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Bank leases certain facilities from two separate entities in which two of its directors have separate ownership interests. Lease payments made to these entities during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 approximated $329 thousand, $379 thousand and $370 thousand, respectively.\nAdditionally, the Bank leases office space to third parties, with original lease terms ranging from 3 to 5 years and option periods ranging up to 15 years. At December 31, 2017, minimum future rents to be received under non-cancelable operating sublease agreements were $46 thousand, $13 thousand, $0 thousand and $0 thousand for the years ending December 31, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Although it is possible that one or more of these leases will be renewed, there is no certainty upon which to base an estimate.\nA summary of rental activities for years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, is as follows:\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rent expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,852\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,480\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: sublease rentals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net rent expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,206\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Asset/Liability Management\nLiquidity refers to the Bank's ability to maintain cash flows sufficient to fund operations and to meet obligations and other commitments in a timely and cost-effective fashion. At various times the Bank requires funds to meet short-term cash requirements brought about by loan growth or deposit outflows, the purchase of assets, or liability repayments. The Bank's large base of core deposits is an integral part of its ability to manage its liquidity position appropriately. These core deposits are generated by offering traditional banking services in its service areas and have, historically, been a stable source of funds. To manage liquidity needs properly, cash inflows must be timed to coincide with anticipated outflows, or other sufficient liquid resources must be available to meet varying demands. The Bank manages cash and investment securities in order to be able to meet unexpected, sudden changes in levels of its assets or deposit liabilities without maintaining excessive amounts of balance sheet liquidity. Excess balance sheet liquidity can negatively impact the Bank's interest margin. In order to meet short-term liquidity needs, the Bank may utilize overnight Federal Funds purchases and other borrowing arrangements with correspondent banks, and use interest rate pricing to attract new deposits from local sources; it also maintains collateralized lines of credit with the FHLB and the FRB. In addition, the Bank can obtain cash for temporary needs by selling securities that it classifies as Available-for-Sale.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Bank had an increase in gross loans of $53.9 million from December 31, 2016, funded in part by the $37.5 million increase in its deposit base and in part by a reduction of $48.1 million in its total cash and cash equivalents. One of the measures of liquidity is our loan-to-deposit ratio, based upon gross loans, which increased to 67.7% at December 31, 2017, compared to 66.1% at December 31, 2016. Each calendar quarter, the Bank performs a six-month cash flow analysis to ensure that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet all of its potential cash obligations under a worst-case scenario, and maintains more than adequate liquidity under those hypothetical conditions.\nFHLB, FRB and Other Borrowings and Available Lines of Credit\nThe Bank has off-balance sheet liquidity in the form of Federal Funds purchase arrangements with correspondent banks, as well as collateralized borrowing arrangements with the FHLB and the FRB. The Bank can borrow from the FHLB on a short-term (typically overnight) or long-term (more than one year) basis. At December 31, 2017, the Bank had no long-term borrowings. The Bank had an available line of credit of $121.4 million with the FHLB of Des Moines at December 31, 2017.\nThe Bank can also borrow from the FRB's discount window. It had $21.5 million of investment securities pledged to the FRB San Francisco as collateral on an available line of credit of $20.9 million at December 31, 2017, none of which credit was outstanding.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Bank had arrangements for Federal Funds purchases of up to $17.0 million from three of its U.S. correspondent financial institutions. The Bank had no Federal Funds purchases outstanding at December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company had no other borrowed funds.\nCapital Resources\nThe Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the United States federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Bank's consolidated financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of its assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items, as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.\nQuantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the following table) of total, Tier 1 and common equity Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined) and of Tier 1 capital (as defined) to average assets (as defined). The common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio was newly required effective January 1, 2015. Management believes, as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, that the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the most recent notification from the FDIC categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well capitalized, an institution must maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the following table. There are no conditions or events since the notification that management believes have changed the Bank's category. The Bank's actual capital amounts and ratios as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, are also presented in the table.\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Actual\n</td> <td>\n</td>

instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments. Market risk is an attribute of\nall market risk sensitive financial instruments, including securities, loans, deposits and borrowings, as well as a company's role as a financial intermediary in customer-related transactions. The objective of market risk management is to avoid excessive exposure of the company's earnings and equity to loss, and to reduce the volatility inherent in certain types of financial instruments.\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nMarket risk arises from changes in interest rates, exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. The Bank's market risk exposure is primarily that of interest rate risk, and it has established policies and procedures to monitor and limit earnings and balance sheet exposure to changes in interest rates. The Bank does not engage in the trading of financial instruments, and has only nominal direct exposure to currency exchange rate risk, but has indirect exposure to exchange rate risk because of the dominant position of foreign tourism in its primary markets.\nThe principal objective of interest rate risk management (often referred to as asset/liability management\u201d) is to manage the financial components of the Bank's balance sheet, as well as their characteristics, in a manner that will optimize the risk/reward equation for earnings and capital in relation to changing interest rates. The Bank's exposure to market risk is reviewed on a monthly basis by its Asset and Liability Committee. Interest rate risk is the potential for economic losses due to future interest rate changes. These economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and/or a loss of current fair market values. The objective is to measure the effect on net interest income and to adjust the balance sheet to minimize the inherent risk while simultaneously maximizing income. Management realizes certain risks are inherent, and that the goal is to identify and manage those risks. Management uses two methodologies to manage interest rate risk: (i) a standard GAP analysis; and (ii) an interest rate shock simulation model.\nThe planning of asset and liability maturities is an integral part of the management of an institution's net interest margin. To the extent that the maturities of assets and liabilities do not match in a changing interest rate environment, the net interest margin may change over time. Even with perfectly matched re-pricing of assets and liabilities, risks remain in the form of prepayment risk for some loans and securities, or in the form of risks of delays in the adjustment of interest rates applying to either earning assets with floating rates or to interest bearing liabilities. The Bank has generally been able to control its exposure to changing interest rates by maintaining a substantial proportion of its portfolio in floating interest rate loans and a majority of its time deposits with relatively short maturities.\nInterest rate changes do not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or at the same time. Varying interest rate environments can create unexpected changes in prepayment levels of assets and liabilities, which may have a significant effect on the net interest margin and are not reflected in the interest sensitivity analysis table. Because of these factors, an interest sensitivity gap report may not provide a complete assessment of the exposure to changes in interest rates.\nThe Bank uses modeling software for asset/liability management in order to simulate the effects of potential interest rate changes on its net interest margin, and to calculate the estimated fair values of the Bank's financial instruments under different interest rate scenarios. The program utilizes current balances, interest rates, maturity dates and re-pricing information for individual financial instruments, and incorporates assumptions on the characteristics of embedded options along with pricing and duration for those instruments to project the effects of a given interest rate change on the Bank's interest income and interest expense. Rate scenarios consisting of key rate and yield curve projections are run against the Bank's investment, loan, deposit and borrowed funds portfolios. These rate projections can be shocked (an immediate and parallel change in all base rates, up or down) and ramped (with incremental increases or decreases in rates over a specified time period), based on current trends and forecasts, including stable economic conditions.\nThe following table sets forth the estimated changes in the Bank's net interest income that would result from the designated instantaneous parallel shifts in interest rates noted, as of December 31, 2017. Computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions, including relative levels of market interest rates, loan prepayments and deposit decay, and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. (Please note that, in the current interest rate environment, the larger reductions in rates presented in the analysis are unlikely to occur.)\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase/(Decrease) in Estimated Net Interest\nIncome\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in Interest Rates (basis points)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 31,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38.04\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28.56\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.93\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.37\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u00b1 0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.00\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (7,640\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -9.34\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (13,180\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -16.11\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (15,674\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -19.16\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (18,075\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -22.10\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese data do not reflect any actions that we may undertake in response to changes in interest rates, such as changes in rates paid on certain deposit accounts based on local competitive factors, which could improve or attenuate the actual impact on net interest income.\nAs with any method of gauging interest rate risk, there are certain shortcomings inherent to the methodology noted above. The model assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous, and result in parallel shifts in the yield curve. In reality, rate changes are rarely instantaneous. The use of the simplifying assumption that short-term and long-term rates change by the same degree also disregards historic rate change patterns, which rarely show parallel yield curve shifts. Further, the model assumes that certain assets and liabilities of similar maturity or period to re-pricing will react in the same way to changes in rates. In reality, certain types of financial instruments may react in advance of changes in market rates, while the reaction of other types of financial instruments may lag significantly behind the change in general market rates. Additionally, the methodology noted above does not reflect the full impact of annual and lifetime restrictions on changes in rates for certain assets, such as adjustable rate loans. When interest rates change, actual loan prepayments and actual early withdrawals from time certificates may deviate significantly from the assumptions used in the model. Finally, this methodology does not measure or reflect the impact that higher rates may have on adjustable-rate loan clients' ability to service their debt. All of these factors are considered in less formulaic ways in monitoring the Bank's exposure to interest rate risk.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nGeneral\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP\u201d). The financial information contained within our consolidated financial statements is, to a significant extent, based on approximate measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred. A variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained, either when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset or relieving a liability. In certain instances, we use a discount factor and prepayment assumptions to determine the present value of assets and liabilities. A change in the discount factor or prepayment speeds could increase or decrease the values of those assets and liabilities, which would result in either a beneficial or adverse impact to our financial results. We use historical loss factors as one factor in determining the inherent loss that may be present in our loan portfolio. Actual losses could differ significantly from the historical factors that we use. Other estimates that we use are related to the realization of our deferred tax assets and the expected useful lives of our depreciable assets. In addition, GAAP itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another, although the economics of our transactions would remain the same.\nFair Value of Securities\nIn accordance with GAAP, the Bank revalues the Available-for-Sale component of its investment portfolio on a quarterly basis, and records any unrealized gain or loss as an adjustment to other comprehensive income in its equity accounts. Held-to-Maturity securities are recorded at their amortized book value. The Bank also evaluates whether any of its security holdings are Other Than Temporarily Impaired ( OTTI\u201d), but has determined that, as of December 31, 2017, none of its securities are deemed to be OTTI.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the potential losses in our loan portfolio. Our accounting for estimated loan losses was previously discussed in this Item 7 under the heading, Allowance for Loan Losses.\u201d\nDeferred Tax Assets\nOur net deferred income tax asset arises from temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities reported in the financial statements and the amounts used for income tax return purposes. Our accounting for Deferred Tax Assets was previously discussed under the heading Income Tax Expense\u201d.\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion And Analysis Of Financial Condition And Results Of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following discussion provides information about the results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and capital resources of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, the Bank. This information is intended to facilitate the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to our financial condition and the results of operations. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nExecutive Summary\nThis summary is intended to identify the most important matters on which management focuses when it evaluates the financial condition and performance of the Bank. When evaluating financial condition and performance, management looks at certain key\nmetrics and measures. The Bank's evaluation includes comparisons with peer group financial institutions and its own performance objectives established in internal planning processes.\nThe primary activity of the Bank is commercial banking, as it has been since the Bank opened in Guam in 1972. The Company's operations are located entirely in the U.S. territories, the U.S.-affiliated nations of the western Pacific, and in the San Francisco Bay area of California. The largest community in the Bank's western Pacific market is Guam, followed by the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. The market includes a number of transportation-, travel- and tourism-related companies in the region, as well as substantial U.S. Department of Defense and other U.S. federal government activities in Guam. The Company's customers are primarily transnational corporations, governments, closely-held businesses and individuals.\nDuring 2017, there were four significant factors that impacted the Company's financial condition and operations:\n \u2022 Over the course of the year, tourist arrivals continued to increase in Guam and other islands in the region. In Guam, the number of visitors reached its highest level in history, at 1.54 million. This was due, in part, to the fact that a moderate, 3.5% decrease in Japanese arrivals was more than offset by increasing arrivals from South Korea and China, with the latter two increasing by 27.4% and 14.0%, respectively. The continuing growth in Guam's tourism industry and increasing arrivals in the other islands led to modest improvements in payroll employment and other aspects of the regional economy, enhancing the Bank's business. \n \u2022 The military buildup continues, and substantial funding is finally being provided for the relocation of U.S. Marines from Okinawa to Guam. Several contracts, totaling hundreds of millions of dollars, were executed during 2017, and additional years of construction and related activity are expected to bring additional investment and income to Guam. Once completed, the activities that these projects support will provide a sustained contribution to the economy. \n \u2022 The continuing strength of the economy in the San Francisco Bay area provided ample opportunities to expand the Bank's business there, leading to an increase of 16.0% in the California region's loan portfolio, supplementing 22.6% growth in loans in the Freely Associated States of Micronesia markets and supporting overall growth of 4.6% in the total loan portfolio, as loans in Guam decreased by 2.2%. The 2.2% growth in the Bank's asset base supported a 4.6% expansion of our gross loan portfolio and an increase of 6.7% in our investment portfolio as we also converted $50.5 million of our cash and cash equivalents to higher yielding assets. \n \u2022 The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of December 2017 caused the Company to reevaluate the valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets. The decrease in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% decreased the likelihood that we will be able to use a large portion of those deferred tax assets in a future period, so a write-down of $2.7 million was applied to our 2017 Income Statement, as reflected there and in our Statement of Financial Condition. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net income attributable to common stockholders was $8.0 million, or $0.86 per diluted common share. For the year ended December 31, 2016, net income was $13.5 million, or $1.46 per diluted common share. For the year ended December 31, 2015, net income was $11.3 million, or $1.25 per diluted common share.\nThe returns on average assets and average equity for the year ended December 31, 2017, were 0.44% and 6.24%, respectively, compared to 0.77% and 11.22%, respectively, for 2016, and 0.74% and 10.50%, respectively, for 2015.\nThe following are major factors that impacted the Company's results of operations:\n \u2022 Net interest income increased 8.3% to $79.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $73.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, due to a $6.1 million increase in interest income that was partially offset by an increase of $52 thousand in interest expense. Net interest income increased by 8.1% to $73.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $67.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, due to a $5.7 million increase in interest income that was partially offset by an increase of $249 thousand in interest expense. \n \u2022 The net interest margin decreased 16 basis points to 4.24% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with 4.39% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in the net interest margin for 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to an eight basis point decrease in the average yields on loans, partially offset by a 23 basis point increase in the average yield on our securities portfolio and a 40 basis point increase in the average yield on our deposits with other financial institutions; the average rates that we paid on deposits decreased by 0.4 basis points. Despite the decrease in the overall average yield of 16 basis points on our total earning assets, higher loan and investment volumes generated higher interest income that more than offset the higher gross amount of interest paid on our customers' deposits. \n \u2022 The provision for loan losses was $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, $3.6 million higher than the provision during 2016. The 2017 provision was increased to reflect the growth of $53.9 million in our loan portfolio as our emphasis shifted moderately from commercial to consumer loans, and is deemed by management to provide a \n sufficient allowance for loan losses due to net losses of $5.7 million during the year. The provision for loan losses was $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was $600 thousand lower than the provision during the previous year. The provision for loan losses was $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, including $12 thousand assigned to the reserve for off-balance sheet risk. \n \u2022 Non-interest income was $16.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, $2.7 million more than the $13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in non-interest income in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to increases of $2.5 million in trustee fees, $792 thousand in service charges and fees, $314 thousand in net income from merchant services and a $257 thousand increase in other income, partially offset by an $813 thousand decrease in net cardholder income, and a reduction of $397 thousand in our realized gain on the sale of investment securities. Non-interest income was $13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, $2.9 million more than the $11.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in non-interest income in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to increases of $1.2 million in net income from merchant services, $911 thousand from service charges and fees, $328 thousand in trustee fees, $325 thousand in net gains on investment securities and $265 thousand in other income, partially offset by a reduction of $134 thousand in net income from cardholders. The increase in merchant income was the result of a correction of accumulated billing errors by our card processor. \n \u2022 Non-interest expense was $70.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $64.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase of 9.7%, primarily due to an increase of $2.6 million in salaries and employee benefits, an additional $1.7 million in equipment and depreciation expense, a rise of $1.0 million in general, administrative and other expenses, and a $400 thousand increase in occupancy expense. Non-interest expense was $64.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $59.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of 8.6% was primarily due to an increase of $3.1 million in salaries and employee benefits, an additional $1.3 million in general, administrative and other expenses, and a rise of $807 thousand in equipment and depreciation expense. These increases were partially offset by a reduction of $264 thousand in the expense associated with other real estate that we owned, primarily foreclosed properties. \n \u2022 The 37.0% decrease of net after tax income to $8.5 million in 2017 compared to $13.6 million 2016 was due to the $6.2 million increase in non-interest expense, the $3.9 million increase in income tax expense and the $3.6 million increase in our provision for loan losses, offset by the $6.1 million increase in total interest income. The 20.0% increase of net after tax income to $13.6 million in 2016 compared to $11.3 million in 2015 was due to the $5.5 million increase in net interest income and the $2.9 million increase in non-interest income, offset by the $5.1 million increase in non-interest expense and the increase of $1.7 million in income taxes. \nThe following are important factors in understanding our current financial condition and liquidity position:\n \u2022 Cash, interest-bearing deposits in other banks, and investment securities available-for-sale collectively decreased by $9.6 million (1.2%), to $586.9 million, at December 31, 2017, from $596.5 million at December 31, 2016. This decrease in liquid assets is due to a decrease of $53.8 million in interest bearing deposits in banks, partially offset by a $40.9 million increase in available-for-sale securities and a $3.3 million increase in cash. \n \u2022 Total assets increased by $44.4 million (2.3%) from $1.92 billion at December 31, 2016, to $1.97 billion at December 31, 2017. This increase was composed of a $51.8 million or 4.5% increase in total loans (net of deferred fees and the allowance for loan losses), to $1.21 billion at December 31, 2017, compared to $1.16 billion at December 31, 2016, an increase of $40.9 million in available-for-sale securities and growth in other assets of $7.1 million, partially offset by a decrease of $50.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, from $176.7 million at December 31, 2016, to $126.1 million at December 31, 2017, and a decrease of $6.5 million in held-to-maturity securities during the same period. The increase in loans was primarily attributable to an increase of $41.4 million in gross consumer loans, to $409.9 million at the end of 2017 compared to $368.5 million a year earlier, and an increase of $12.5 million in gross commercial loans, to $820.0 million at December 31, 2017, from $807.5 million at December 31, 2016. In support of the growth of total assets, total liabilities increased by $38.4 million, to $1.83 billion at December 31, 2017, based upon the addition of $37.5 million in total deposits from the previous year end, and an increase of $5.9 million in total stockholders' equity, to $138.1 million, composed of the $4.3 million increase in retained earnings and $1.6 million in additional paid-in common stock. \n \u2022 Classified assets increased to $32.3 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $20.6 million at December 31, 2016. \n \u2022 The allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2017, was $17.3 million, or 1.40% of total gross loans. The allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2016, was $15.4 million, or 1.31% of total gross loans. \n \u2022 Nonperforming loans increased by $1.3 million to $8.1 million, or 0.66% of total gross loans, at December 31, 2017, from $6.8 million, or 0.58% of total gross loans, at December 31, 2016. \n \u2022 Net loan charge-offs were $5.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the $2.6 million in net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2016. \n \u2022 The ratio of noncore funding of $16.5 million (which consists of $250,000 and over time deposits plus short-term borrowings) to total assets was 0.84% at December 31, 2017, compared to $33.7 million, or 1.75% of total assets, at December 31, 2016. \n \u2022 The loan-to-deposit ratio increased to 67.7% at December 31, 2017, as compared to 66.1% at December 31, 2016, due to total gross loan growth of $53.9 million far exceeding the $37.5 million increase in deposits. \n \u2022 Capital ratios significantly exceed regulatory requirements for a well-capitalized financial institution, both at the Company level and in the Bank. The leverage ratio of the Company was 7.19%, with a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 11.58%, a total risk-based capital ratio of 12.83%, and a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 10.78% at December 31, 2017. The leverage ratio at the Company was 7.30%, with a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 11.74%, a total risk-based capital ratio of 12.99% and a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 10.89% at December 31, 2016. The leverage ratio at the Bank was 6.97%, with a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 11.24%, a total risk-based capital ratio of 12.49%, and a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 10.83% at December 31, 2017. The leverage ratio at the Bank was 7.06%, with a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 11.36%, a total risk-based capital ratio of 12.61% and a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 10.93% at December 31, 2016. The regulatory well-capitalized guidelines are a minimum of a 5% leverage ratio, a 8% Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, a 10% total risk-based capital ratio, and a 6.5% common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio. The changes in our capital ratios from December 31, 2016, to December 31, 2017, were due to the retention of $4.3 million in earnings during 2017, along with the issuance of common stock in the amount of $1.6 million. \nDeposits\nThe composition and cost of the Bank's deposit base are important in analyzing the Bank's net interest margin and balance sheet liquidity characteristics. The Bank's depositors are generally located in its primary market area. Depending on loan demand and other funding requirements, the Bank also attracts deposits through its interest rate pricing. The Bank monitors all deposits that may be sensitive to interest rate changes to help ensure that liquidity risk does not become excessive due to deposit migration. Deposits at December 31, 2017, were $1.82 billion, compared to $1.78 billion at December 31, 2016. The 2.1% increase was primarily due to the acquisition of additional government and commercial accounts in the Freely Associated States, U.S. government payments for land use and other purposes, and the growth in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands' tourism sector and general economic recovery, partially offset by decreases in the Bank's deposits in the Guam and in the California region.\nThe Bank does not currently accept brokered deposits because it already maintains ample liquidity.\nLiquidity\nOur liquidity position refers to our ability to maintain cash flows sufficient to fund operations and to meet obligations and other commitments in a timely fashion. We believe that the Bank's liquidity position is more than sufficient to meet our operating expenses, borrowing needs and other obligations for 2018, and management has tested and determined that, even under severely stressed scenarios, the Bank's liquidity will be more than adequate to meet our requirements. Our liquidity increased substantially during 2017. Once the increases in our loan portfolio and other assets were accommodated, the increases in our liabilities and equity were channeled into short-term earning assets as a defensive measure due to historically low interest rates and yields, and the possibility that those rates and yields will increase further as the U.S. economy continues to improve. At December 31, 2017, we had $126.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately $159.3 million in available borrowing capacity from various sources, including the Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB\u201d), the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco ( FRB\u201d), and Federal Funds facilities with several financial institutions. The Bank also had $245.9 million in unpledged securities available at December 31, 2017. Our loan-to-deposit ratio increased to 67.7% at December 31, 2017, compared to 66.1% at December 31, 2016, as our gross loans increased by 4.6% and our deposits grew by 2.1%.\nLending\nOur loans originate almost entirely through the branch offices located in our primary market. As the Bank approached a saturation point in our island service area, we expanded our activities in California through our branch in San Francisco. The total loan portfolio remains well diversified with commercial and industrial loans accounting for 20.8% and commercial real estate loans accounting for 45.8% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2017. Construction loans rose from 0.5% of the portfolio at December 31, 2016, to 0.8% at December 31, 2017. Residential mortgages and other consumer-related loans accounted for the remaining 33.3% of total loans at December 31, 2017. The increase in gross loans in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to an increase of 11.2% in our\nconsumer loan portfolio, supplemented by growth of 1.6% in commercial loans. The Bank also had a decrease of $5.5 million in loans sold to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( Freddie Mac\u201d) from $211.0 million at December 31, 2016, to $205.5 million at December 31, 2017, but these loans are off-book, except for the value of the associated mortgage servicing rights. The Bank exercises careful selectivity with respect to the types of loans it chooses to originate.\nNet Interest Income\nThe management of interest income and expense is fundamental to the performance of the Company and the Bank. Net interest income, the difference between interest income and interest expense, is the largest component of the Bank's total revenue. Management closely monitors both total net interest income and the net interest margin (net interest income divided by average earning assets).\nThe Bank, through its asset and liability management policies and practices, as overseen by its Asset and Liability Committee, seeks to maximize net interest income without exposing itself to an excessive level of interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is managed by monitoring the pricing, maturity and repricing options of all classes of interest bearing assets and liabilities. This is discussed in more detail under Liquidity and Asset/Liability Management. In addition, as the market allows, we take measures and initiatives to improve our net interest margin, including increasing loan rates, maintaining interest rate floors on floating rate loans, reducing nonperforming assets, managing deposit interest rates and reducing higher-cost deposits.\nFrom January 22, 2008, through December 16, 2008, the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee reduced its target short-term interest rates by 325 basis points, to a range of 0.00% to 0.25%, in response to the credit crisis and economic downturn that resulted from the collapse in the U.S. housing market and the subsequent global recession. The target Federal Funds Rate was raised to a range of 0.25% to 0.50% on December 16, 2015, then again to a range of 0.50% to 0.75% on December 15, 2016. During 2017, the target Federal Funds Rate was increased by 25 basis points three times, on March 15, June 14 and December 13, ending in a target range from 1.25% to 1.50%. The increase in short-term rates will gradually affect the rates applicable to many of the Bank's loans. The increase in short-term interest rates raised the overall cost of interest bearing deposits, which represent the Bank's primary funding source, by 11.0% by the end of 2017, as they tend to re-price more slowly than floating rate loans. The continuing low level of short-term interest rates, including the prime rate, has significantly compressed the Bank's net interest margin, but that pressure is gradually being eased.\nManagement of Credit Risk\nWe continue to proactively identify, quantify and manage our problem loans. Early identification of problem loans and potential future losses helps enable us to resolve credit issues with potentially less risk and lower ultimate losses. We maintain an allowance for loan losses in an amount that we believe is adequate to absorb probable and projected incurred losses in the portfolio. While we strive to carefully monitor and manage credit quality and to identify loans that may be deteriorating, circumstances can change at any time that may result in future losses for loans included in the portfolio, that as of the date of the financial statements have not yet been identified as potential problem loans. Through established credit practices, we adjust the allowance for loan losses accordingly. However, because future events are uncertain, there may be loans that deteriorate, some of which could occur in an accelerated time frame. As a result, future additions to the allowance may be necessary. Because the loan portfolio contains a number of commercial loans, commercial real estate and construction loans with relatively large balances, deterioration in the credit quality of one or more of these loans may require a significant increase to the allowance for loan losses. Future additions to the allowance may also be required based on changes in the financial condition of borrowers, such as have resulted due to changing economic conditions. Additionally, federal and local banking regulators throughout our market area, as an integral part of their supervisory function, periodically review our allowance for loan losses. These regulatory agencies may require us to recognize further loan loss provisions or charge-offs based upon their judgments, which may be different from ours. Any increase in the allowance for loan losses may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.\nWe also maintain a reserve against potential credit risks associated with our unfunded off-balance sheet loan commitments.\nFurther discussion of the management of credit risk appears under Provision for Loan Losses\u201d and Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d.\nNon-Interest Income\nWhile net interest income remains the largest single component of total revenues, non-interest income is an important source, as well. In total, the Bank received $16.6 million in non-interest income during 2017, an increase of $2.7 million from the $13.9 million recorded for 2016, and $5.6 million more than the $11.0 million received in 2015. The increase from 2016 to 2017 was due in part to a $2.5 million increase in trustee fees, an increase of $792 thousand in service charges and fees, and a $314 thousand increase in net income from merchant services, partially offset by an $813 thousand decrease in net cardholders income, along with a $397 thousand\ndrop in our gains from the sale of investment securities. The increase in trustee fees was substantially based on the recovery of certain investment fees, the higher service charges and fees primarily came from a charge implemented against low-balance accounts and the institution of a fee for paper account statements, and the increase in merchant services income resulted from the growth of the portfolio and a decrease in cross-border fees, while the decrease in cardholders income resulted in part from the increase in fees and the lower gain on the sale of securities was caused by market price fluctuations.\nNon-Interest Expense\nManagement considers the control of operating expenses to be a critical element of the performance of the Company and the Bank. As in years past, the Bank has undertaken initiatives to contain its non-interest expense and improve its efficiency. Nevertheless, total non-interest expense was $70.4 million for year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $64.1 million for year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $6.2 million. This increase was largely the result of increasing costs associated with salaries and employee benefits, from $31.6 million in 2016 to $34.2 million in 2017, the rise in equipment and depreciation expense and higher general, administrative and other expenses, which increased by $1.7 million and $1.0 million, respectively. Operating expenses in 2016 were $5.1 million higher than in 2015, primarily due to increasing costs associated with salaries and employee benefits, from $28.5 million in 2015 to $31.6 million in 2016, higher general administrative and other expenses and the rise in equipment and depreciation expense, which increased by $1.3 million and $807 thousand, respectively. For both 2016 and 2017, the increases in operating expenses were primarily the result of organic growth in the size of the Bank.\nCapital Management\nAs part of its asset and liability management process, the Company continually assesses its capital position to take into consideration growth, expected earnings, risk profile and potential corporate activities that it may choose to pursue.\nDuring the past several years, the Bank's principal source of increases in capital has been retained earnings, supplemented by stock purchases through our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report for a description of the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Since the formation of the Company in 2011, though, the Bank's assets have grown by 78.2%, and those more traditional sources of additional capital have not kept pace.\nAlthough the Bank remains well capitalized\u201d by all four regulatory measures of capital adequacy, the Bank's Tier 1 ratio had been decreasing because of its rapid asset growth, primarily attributed to the substantial growth in customer deposits. Consequently, the Company placed an additional $2.8 million of its common stock as of December 31, 2015, placed $9.8 million in non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock during 2016 and offered up to an additional $20.0 million in common stock at a purchase price of $12.25 per common share commencing September 29, 2017. Of this latest offering, $1.3 million had been placed as of December 31, 2017.\nIn the 2015 and 2016 offerings, the Company issued its stock to certain \"accredited investors\" within the meaning of Rule 501 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), at a purchase price of $9.85 per common share in 2015 and a purchase price of $1,000.00 per preferred share in 2016 (the \"Offerings\"). These are restricted shares, which may not be resold for a period of two years. The terms of the offerings were set forth in their respective Stock Purchase Agreements, dated July 30, 2015, and September 28, 2016, entered into between the Company and each investor. A portion of the proceeds from the offerings was used to retire subordinated debt, while the remainder will allow the Company to support the continued organic growth of its banking subsidiary in its existing market areas and will enable us to further serve the needs of individuals and businesses in those markets.\nThe Company's common and preferred stock was offered and sold only to investors that met the \"accredited investor\" definition of Rule 501 of the Securities Act in reliance on the exemption from registration afforded under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and Rule 504 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. The common stock offered in the Offerings has not been registered under the Securities Act or state securities laws, and may not be offered or sold in the United States without being registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") or through an applicable exemption from SEC registration requirements.\nResults of Operations\nThe Bank earns income from two primary sources. The first is net interest income, which is interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities. The second is non-interest income, which primarily consists of service charges and fees, income from merchants for processing credit and debit card transactions, non-interest income from holders of the Bank's credit cards, trustee fees and net investment securities gains. The majority of the Company's non-interest expenses are operating costs that relate to providing a full range of banking services to our customers.\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\nThe level of net interest income depends on several factors in combination, including earning assets, yields on earning assets, the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, and the relative volumes of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. To maintain its net interest margin, the Bank must manage the relationship between interest earned and interest paid.\nDistribution, Rate and Yield\nThe following Distribution, Rate and Yield table presents the average amounts outstanding during 2017 and 2016 for the major categories of the Company's balance sheet, the average interest rates earned or paid thereon, and the resulting net interest margin on average interest earning assets for the periods indicated. Average balances are based on monthly averages.\nTable 59: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

financial institutions and the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. \n Includes all investment securities in the Available-for-Sale and the Held-to-Maturity classifications. \n Includes average balances of non-accrual loans. \nThe Distribution, Rate and Yield table above sets forth the dollar amounts in interest earned and paid for each major category of interest earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for the noted periods, as well as their respective yields and costs, and the resulting interest rate spreads and net interest margins.\nThe Bank's net interest margin, expressed as a percentage of average earning assets, was 4.24% for 2017, down 15 basis points from 4.39% for 2016, even though average earning assets increased by 12.0% during the year, from $1.67 billion in 2016 to $1.87 billion in 2017. The primary reason for the decrease in the net interest margin was that our funding cost increased by 11.0%, from $2.0 million in 2016 to $2.2 million in 2017. Our average loan balances increased by $57.8 million, or 5.1%, but the average yield on the entire loan portfolio decreased by 9 basis points so that interest earnings on loans increased by only $2.5 million, or 3.6%. New loans made in a more competitive environment caused the decrease in the average yield on the loan portfolio. Yields on our investment securities portfolio increased by 23 basis points and the yield on short term investments went up by 40 basis points, but the yield on average earning assets decreased from 4.52% to 4.36% from 2016 to 2017. Average total interest-bearing liabilities increased by 13.5% during 2017, to $1.31 billion from $1.15 billion the previous year.\nNet interest income for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased by $5.9 million, to $79.5 million, compared to $73.4 million a year earlier, primarily due to an increase in interest income derived from the growth in our investment securities portfolio, supplemented by increases in earnings on average loan balances and our short term deposits in other banks, including the Federal\nReserve Bank of San Francisco. Net interest income for 2016 increased by $5.5 million from 2015, due to an increase of $5.7 million in interest income derived from the growth in average loan balances, a higher average investment portfolio and an increase in our average deposits with other banks, only slightly offset by an increase of $249 thousand in the interest that we paid on average deposit balances and other borrowed funds. The Bank's net interest margin was 4.40% in 2016, compared to 4.66% in 2015, a decrease of 26 basis points.\nA substantial portion of the Bank's earning assets are variable-rate loans that re-price when the Bank's reference rate, which usually corresponds with the New York prime lending rate, is changed. This is in contrast to a large base of core deposits that are generally slower to re-price. This causes the Bank's balance sheet to be liability-sensitive, which means that, all else being equal, net interest margin will be lower during periods when short-term interest rates are rising and higher when rates are falling. However, we will not necessarily have to raise rates on the personal savings portion of our core deposits as general market interest rates increase, mitigating the sensitivity of our net interest margin to rising interest rates.\nThe following table provides information regarding the changes in interest income and interest expense, attributable to changes in rates and changes in volumes that contribute to the total change in net interest income for the years ending December 31, 2017 and 2016. Variances attributable to both rate and volume changes are equal to the change in rate times the change in average balance and are included below in the average volume column.\nTable 63: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Attributable to:\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net Change in\nInterest\nIncome/Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change in\nRate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change in Volume\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Short term investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment Securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (963\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,635\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest-bearing checking accounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Money market and savings accounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (44\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Certificates of deposit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other borrowings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (165\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (165\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (31\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,604\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,686\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProvision for Loan Losses\nCredit risk is inherent in the lending business. The Bank establishes an allowance for loan losses through charges to earnings, which are shown in the statements of income as the provision for loan losses. Specifically identifiable and quantifiable known losses are promptly charged off against the allowance. The provision for loan losses is allocated monthly and evaluated quarterly through a determination of the adequacy of the Bank's allowance for loan losses, and reset if necessary, charging the shortfall, if any, to the current quarter's expense. This has the effect of creating variability in the amount and frequency of charges to the Bank's earnings. The provision for loan losses and level of allowance for each period are dependent upon many factors, including loan growth, net charge-offs, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio, delinquencies, management's assessment of the quality of the loan portfolio, the valuation of problem loans and the general economic conditions in the Bank's market area.\nFor 2017, the Bank had a provision for loan and credit losses of $7.5 million, which included $6 thousand assigned to the reserve for unfunded credit commitments. The remaining 2017 provision was $3.6 million more than the provision for 2016, and higher than the provision of $4.5 million for 2015. The 2017 provision was increased to reflect the growth of $53.9 million in our loan portfolio as our emphasis shifted moderately from commercial to consumer loans, and is deemed by management to provide a sufficient allowance for loan losses due to net losses of $5.7 million during the year, as well as to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that is adequate to absorb all reasonably expected future losses and to express management's perception of risk in the existing loan portfolio, as well as changes in the quality of that portfolio. The 2016 provision for loan losses decreased by $600 thousand compared to the $4.5 million provision during 2015.\nThe allowance for loan losses represented 1.40%, 1.31% and 1.44% of total gross loans at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operating income to bring the allowance for loan losses to a level deemed appropriate by the Bank based on the factors discussed under Allowance for Loan Losses.\u201d\nNon-interest income\nThe following table sets forth the various components of the Company's non-interest income:\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase (decrease) 2017\nversus 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase (decrease) 2016\nversus 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service charges and fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,616\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,824\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment securities gains (losses), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (397\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -99.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 427.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income from merchant services, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,108\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,205\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 133.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income from cardholders, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,754\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (813\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -46.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (134\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -7.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Trustee fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,518\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 276.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 56.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,671\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,992\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal non-interest income in 2017 was $2.7 million, or 19.2%, higher than in 2016, primarily because of increases of $2.5 million in trustee fees, $792 thousand in service charges and fees, $314 thousand in net income from merchant services and $257 thousand in other income, in part due to the implementation of a nominal fee for mailed paper account statements and in part to organic growth. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $813 thousand in net income from cardholders due to an increase in fees and a decline of $397 thousand in net gains on the sale of securities because of a less favorable interest rate environment. Other sources of non-interest income include loan servicing fees and income from the Bank-owned life insurance policies. The proportional composition of non-interest income remained relatively stable, with the increase in trustee fees and the decrease in net income from cardholders being the only changes exceeding 5.0% of the respective year's total from 2016 to 2017. Total non-interest income in 2016 was $2.9 million higher than in 2015, primarily because of a sharp increase of $1.2 million, or 133.4%, in income from merchant services due to the correction of accumulated billing errors by a vendor, the on-boarding of new merchant customers subsequent to the closure of a competing merchant services provider in Guam and an increase in net residuals that resulted from a reduction in cross-border fees; an increase of $911 thousand in service charges and fees that resulted from the full implementation of a fee to offset the costs of low-balance savings accounts; an increase of $328 thousand in trustee fees generated by increased revenue sharing in the higher interest rate environment; and a $325 thousand increase in net gains on the sale of investment securities.\nNon-interest expense\nThe following table sets forth the various components of the Company's non-interest expense:\nTable 65: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years

December 31, 2017, an increase of $6.2 million from $64.1 million in 2016. This increase is primarily attributed to the $2.6 million increase in salaries & employee benefits, up by 8.1% from the year ended December 31, 2016, due to merit raises and increases in some benefits expenses, as well as an increase in the number of employees necessary to accommodate the expansion and restructuring of the Bank's operations. In addition, our equipment and depreciation expense increased by $1.7 million, primarily due to the implementation of new technologies and increased information security expenses; general, administrative and other expenses increased by $1.0 million, and occupancy expense rose by $400 thousand.\nIn 2016, total non-interest expense increased by $5.1 million to $64.1 million, as compared to $59.0 million in 2015. This increase is primarily attributed to the $3.1 million increase in salaries & employee benefits, up by 11.0% from the year ended December 31, 2016, due to merit raises and increases in some benefits expenses, as well as an increase in the number of employees necessary to accommodate the expansion of the Bank's operations. In addition, general, administrative and other expenses increased by $1.3 million and our equipment and depreciation expense increased by $807 thousand. These increases were partially offset by modest decreases in the expenses associated with other real estate that is owned by the Bank, occupancy expense and contract services expense.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe Company computes its provision for income taxes on a monthly basis. The effective tax rate is determined by applying the Bank's statutory income tax rate to pre-tax book income, as adjusted for permanent differences between pre-tax book income and actual taxable income. These permanent differences include, but are not limited to, tax-exempt interest income, increases in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies, certain expenses that are not allowed as tax deductions, and tax credits.\nThe Bank pays income taxes in Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands under a territorial mirror\u201d of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, with payments made to the respective territorial governments instead of the U.S. Treasury; there is no equivalent of a state income tax in either of these jurisdictions. The Bank also pays taxes to the governments of the Republic of Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the State of California. The Bank's territorial and state income tax expense in 2017 was $9.6 million, as compared to an income tax expense of $5.7 million in 2016 and $4.1 million in 2015. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to a change in the valuation allowance for our deferred tax asset that resulted from the reduction in the maximum corporate income tax rate under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which became law on December 22, 2017, and which was only partially offset by the reduction in our net income before taxes.\nThe difference in the effective tax rate compared to the combined territorial, foreign and state statutory tax rate of 35% still in effect for 2017 is primarily the result of the Bank's portfolio of tax-exempt loans to the government of Guam totaling $25.9 million and $30.3 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nSome items of income and expense are recognized in different years for tax purposes than when applying generally accepted accounting principles, leading to timing differences between the Bank's actual tax liability and the amount accrued for this liability based on book income. These temporary differences comprise the deferred\u201d portion of the Bank's tax expense or benefit, which is accumulated on the Bank's books as a deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability until such time as they reverse. At the end of 2017 and 2016, the Bank had a gross deferred tax asset of $7.4 million and $11.3 million, respectively.\nRealization of the net deferred tax asset is primarily dependent upon the Bank generating sufficient taxable income to obtain a benefit from the reversal of net deductible temporary differences, utilization of tax credit carry-forwards and the net operating loss carry-forwards for Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and California state income tax purposes. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods based on estimates of future taxable income. Under generally accepted accounting principles, a valuation allowance is required to be recognized if it is more likely than not\u201d that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The determination of whether the deferred tax assets will actually be realized is highly subjective and dependent upon judgment concerning management's evaluation of both positive and negative evidence, including forecasts of future income, cumulative losses, applicable tax planning strategies, and assessments of current and future economic and business conditions.\nIn assessing the realization of deferred tax assets at December 31, 2017, based on these factors, the Bank believed that it was more likely than not that the Bank will realize only $5.5 million of the benefits of these deductible differences. Therefore, a valuation allowance of $2.0 million for its deferred tax asset was recorded at December 31, 2017.\nIn assessing the realization of deferred tax assets at December 31, 2016, the Bank believed that it was more likely than not that the Bank would realize only $8.1 million of the benefits of these deductible differences. Therefore, a valuation allowance of $3.2 million for the deferred tax asset was recorded at December 31, 2016.\nFinancial Condition\nAs of December 31, 2017, total assets were $1.97 billion, an increase of 2.3% from $1.92 billion at December 31, 2016. Total securities available-for-sale (at fair value) were $460.8 million, an increase of 9.7% from $419.9 million at December 31, 2016. The total loan portfolio, net of allowance for loan losses and deferred fees, was $1.21 billion, an increase of 4.5% from $1.16 billion at year-end 2016. Interest bearing deposits in banks were reduced by more than one third during 2017, falling to $97.1 million from $150.9 million at the end of 2016. Total deposits were $1.82 billion, an increase of 2.1% from $1.78 billion at year-end 2016. The Bank had no short-term borrowings at December 31, 2017.\nSecurities Portfolio\nThe following table reflects the estimated fair value of Available-for-Sale securities and the amortized cost of

earning assets, and the structure and composition of this portfolio is important to an analysis of the financial condition of the Bank and the Company. The portfolio serves the following\npurposes: (i) it provides a source of pledged assets for securing certain deposits and borrowed funds, as may be required by law or by specific agreement with a depositor or lender; (ii) it can be used as an interest rate risk management tool, since it provides a large base of assets, the maturity and interest rate characteristics of which can be changed more readily than the loan portfolio to better match changes in the deposit base and other funding sources of the Bank; and (iii) it is an alternative interest earning use of funds when loan demand is weak or when deposits grow more rapidly than loans.\nEighty-four percent of the Bank's securities at December 31, 2017, were classified under existing accounting rules as Available-for-Sale\u201d to allow flexibility in the management of the portfolio. Accounting guidance requires Available-for-Sale securities to be marked to fair market value, with an offset to other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders' equity, recorded on a quarterly basis. The remaining 16.3% of the investment portfolio was in Held-to-Maturity securities, which the Bank is willing and believes it will be able to retain until they mature, and which are recorded on an amortized cost basis.\nThe Bank's portfolio has historically been comprised primarily of: (i) U.S. government agency and sponsored entities' debt securities for liquidity and pledging; (ii) U.S. government agency and sponsored entities' mortgage-backed securities, which in many instances can also be used for pledging, and which generally enhance the yield of the portfolio; and (iii) U.S. government agency pool securities, which generally enhance the yield of the portfolio. Since the downgrade of many municipal obligations and their respective insurers in the past few years, the Bank no longer holds municipal bonds, but may do so again when markets become more stable.\nCompared to December 31, 2016, the Bank's securities portfolio increased by $34.4 million to 28.0% of total assets at December 31, 2017, from 26.9% at December 31, 2016. The Bank increased its holding of mortgage-back securities by $11.2 million to $107.2 million at December 31, 2017, from $96.0 million at December 31, 2016. During the same period, the Bank's holdings of U.S. government agency pool securities increased by $43.4 million, to $294.1 million, and its holdings of U.S. government agency and sponsored enterprise debt securities decreased by $20.1 million, to $149.2 million. The Bank has not used interest rate swaps or other derivative instruments to hedge fixed rate loans or securities to otherwise mitigate interest rate risk.\nLoans\nThe Bank's loans represent the largest portion of earning assets, substantially greater than the securities portfolio or any other asset category, and the quality and diversification of the loan portfolio is an important consideration when assessing the financial condition of the Bank and the Company.\nGross loans represented 62.6% of total assets at December 31, 2017, as compared to 61.2% at December 31, 2016. The ratio of gross loans to deposits increased to 67.7% at the end of 2017 from 66.1% at the end of 2016. Demand for loans has strengthened within the Bank's California, Freely Associated States and Northern Mariana Islands markets due to the improving economic environment, but the Bank has remained selective with respect to the types of loans it chooses to originate.\nThe Loan Distribution table that follows sets forth the Bank's gross loans outstanding, deferred fee income amortized over the life of some loans, the allowance for loan losses and the percentage distribution in each loan category at the dates indicated.\nLoan Portfolio\nTable 69: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>

governments), primarily in commercial real estate, hotels and gas stations, with the balance in working capital and equipment financing. These are followed by other consumer loans and residential mortgages. The increase in the Bank's loan portfolio in 2017 was due to customary loan activity throughout our markets, the addition of several significant commercial loans in both the San Francisco and Guam regions, and consumer loan promotions. The Bank's gross loans were concentrated in Guam and San Francisco, at 87.8% of our net loan portfolio as of December 31, 2017, compared to 87.1% as of December 31, 2016. The only industry concentration that was considered significant at December 31, 2017, was within our commercial mortgage loan portfolio, which at 45.0% of total gross loans constituted a lower proportion than the 47.0% of total loans at the end of 2016.\nThe Bank's commercial & industrial loans are made for working capital, financing the purchase of equipment and other business purposes. Commercial loans include loans with maturities ranging from thirty days to one year and term loans\u201d with maturities normally ranging from three to ten years. Short- term business loans are generally intended to finance current transactions and typically provide for periodic principal payments, with interest payable monthly. Term loans normally carry floating interest rates, with monthly payments of both principal and interest, but may be amortized over a longer period than the term of the loan, with a balloon payment at the end of the term.\nThe Bank is an active participant in the Small Business Administration (SBA), State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI), Nor-Cal Financial Development Corp. and U.S. Department of Agriculture guaranteed lending programs, and has been approved by the SBA as a lender under the Preferred and Patriot Express Lender Programs. The Bank regularly makes such guaranteed loans and is frequently recognized as the largest originator of SBA loans in Guam, with an outstanding volume of $6.5 million at December 31, 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2017, commercial and residential real estate loans of $702.5 million consist primarily of adjustable and fixed rate loans secured by deeds of trust or mortgages on commercial and residential property, and comprised 57.1% of the total loan portfolio. The Bank's commercial mortgages at December 31, 2017, consist of $553.1 million, or 45.0% of gross loans. Commercial construction loans comprise $10.2 million, or 0.8%, of gross loans. Residential mortgages, including home equity loans, were $138.5 million, or 11.3%, of gross loans. Properties securing the commercial and residential real estate loans are located in the Bank's primary markets, which include the San Francisco Bay area.\nThe Bank's commercial real estate loans consist primarily of loans based on the borrower's cash flow and are secured by deeds of trust or mortgages on commercial and residential property to provide a secondary source of repayment. The Bank generally restricts commercial real estate term loans to no more than the lower of 75% of the property's appraised value or the purchase price of the property during the initial underwriting of the credit, depending on the type of property and its utilization. The Bank offers both fixed\nand floating rate loans. Maturities on commercial real estate loans are generally five years (with amortization up to twenty-five years and a balloon payment due at maturity), and maturities on residential mortgage loans are typically between 15 and 30 years, with many of those loans sold to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation with the retention of servicing rights. SBA and certain other real estate loans that can be sold in the secondary market may be granted for longer maturities.\nThe Bank's construction loans primarily finance the development and construction of commercial and residential properties. The Bank uses underwriting guidelines to assess the likelihood of repayment from sources such as sale of the property or availability of permanent mortgage financing prior to making the construction loan. Construction loans increased by $3.7 million to $10.2 million at December 31, 2017, from $6.4 million at December 31, 2016.\nAdditionally, the Bank makes consumer loans for the purpose of financing automobiles, various types of consumer goods, and other personal purposes. Consumer loans generally provide for the monthly payment of principal and interest. Most of the Bank's consumer loans are either unsecured, secured by the personal property being purchased or, in the case of home equity loans, real property.\nAt December 31, 2017, total gross loans increased by $53.9 million, or 4.6%, to $1.23 billion from $1.18 billion at December 31, 2016. The increase in loans was largely attributed to a $41.4 million increase in consumer loans to $409.9 million at December 31, 2017, from $368.5 million at December 31, 2016. This was primarily due to the rapid growth in other consumer loans, consisting of revolving and installment credit and overdrafts, which was the result a pre-approved loan campaign and holiday loan promotions. The increase was partially offset by a $6.0 million decrease in residential mortgages and a $308 thousand decline in automobile loans. Commercial loans increased by $12.5 million during 2017, from $807.5 million to $820.0 million, due to the $8.0 million increase in commercial & industrial loans, a $3.7 million rise in commercial construction loans, and the $853 thousand increase in commercial mortgage loans, all only slightly offset by the decrease of $31 thousand in the commercial agriculture loan category.\nAt December 31, 2017, loans outstanding were comprised of approximately 65.0% variable rate loans and 35.0% fixed rate loans.\nSince it first opened in 1972, the Bank has expanded its operations and its branch network, first in Guam, then in the other islands of our region and in San Francisco, California. In the interests of enhancing performance and stability through market and industry diversification, the Bank has increased its focus on growth in the San Francisco area in recent years, adding personnel with experience and expertise in the Bay Area. The following table provides figures for gross loans in the Bank's administrative regions for the years ending December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017:\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> At December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Guam\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 681,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 720,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 704,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 73,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 75,658\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 79,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> The Freely Associated States of Micronesia *\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 57,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 76,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 93,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> California\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 258,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 303,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 352,165\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,070,588\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,176,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,229,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n * The Freely Associated States are comprised of the Federated States of Micronesia (Chuuk, Kosrae, Pohnpei and Yap), the Republic of Palau and the Republic of the Marshall Islands. \nThe figures for 2015 and 2016 above have been updated from previous Annual Reports on Form 10-K to reflect their gross instead of their net amounts.\nAs the table indicates, the Bank's total gross loans increased by 4.6% during 2017 and by 9.8% during 2016. Total loans in California increased by $48.6 million, or 16.0%, accounting for 90.3% of total portfolio growth during 2017. Loan growth in the Freely Associated States of Micronesia was second, with growth at $17.2 million, or 32.0% of total loan growth, and outstanding loans in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands grew by $3.8 million, or 5.1% of total growth, whereas outstanding loan balances in Guam decreased by $15.8 million, primarily due to the repayment of a single, large commercial loan during the year. For the two years ended December 31, 2017, California accounted for 58.6% of total loan growth, while the Freely Associated States contributed 22.7%, Guam accounted for 14.8% and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands provided 3.9% of total gross loan portfolio growth during that two-year period. The economy in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands has been recovering at a more rapid pace, but loan growth there has not yet caught up.\nLoan Maturities\nThe following table presents the maturity distribution of the Bank's loans as of December 31, 2017. The table also shows the distribution of such loans between those with predetermined (fixed) interest rates and those with variable (floating) interest rates.\nFloating rates generally fluctuate with changes in the New York prime rate, as reflected in The Wall Street Journal, and the Bank of Guam prime rate.\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> At December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Due in Less\nThan 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Due in More Than\n1 Year But Less\nThan 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Due in More\nThan 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Non-Accrual\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 116,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 276,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 419,978\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 820,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Residential Mortgages\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,551\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 118,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 138,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer Loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 186,689\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 57,558\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 271,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 145,767\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 474,969\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 595,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,229,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Variable rate loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 101,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 211,874\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 477,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,222\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 799,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fixed rate loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 263,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 118,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,131\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 430,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 145,767\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 474,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 595,792\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,229,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoan Servicing\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, there were $205.5 million and $211.0 million, respectively, in Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation loans that were serviced by the Bank.\nLoan servicing rights are included in Accrued Interest Receivable and Other Assets on the consolidated balance sheets, and are reported at their estimated fair value.\nNonperforming Assets\nFinancial institutions generally have a certain level of exposure to credit quality risk, and could potentially receive less than a full return of principal and interest if a debtor becomes unable or unwilling to repay. Since loans are the most significant assets of the Bank and generate the largest portion of its revenues, the Bank's management of credit risk is focused primarily on loan quality.\nBanks have generally suffered their most severe earnings declines as a result of customers' inability to generate sufficient cash flow to service their debts, and/or downturns in national and regional economies and declines in overall asset values, including real estate prices.\nThe Bank's credit policies identify allowable geographic credit concentrations. In addition, these policies establish the Bank's underwriting standards and the methods of monitoring credit quality on an ongoing basis. The Bank's internal credit risk controls are focused on underwriting practices, credit originating procedures, training, risk management techniques, and familiarity with loan customers, as well as the relative diversity and geographic concentration of our loan portfolio.\nThe Bank's credit risk may also be affected by external factors, such as the level of interest rates, employment, general economic conditions, real estate values, and trends in particular industries or geographic markets. As an independent community bank serving a specific geographic area, the Bank must contend with the unpredictable changes in the general regional market and, particularly, primary local markets. The Bank's asset quality has been affected in the past by the impact of national and regional recessions, consumer bankruptcies, and depressed real estate values.\nNonperforming assets are comprised of the following: loans for which the Bank is no longer accruing interest; restructured loans that are more than 90 days past due; loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest (although they are generally placed on non-accrual when they become 90 days past due, unless they are both well-secured and in the process of revision or collection); and other real estate owned ( OREO\u201d) that is acquired through foreclosures. Management's classification of a loan as non-accrual\u201d is an indication that there is reasonable doubt as to the full recovery of principal or interest on the loan. At that point, the Bank stops accruing interest income, and reverses any uncollected interest that had previously been accrued. These loans may or may not be collateralized, and collection efforts are pursued. The Bank begins recognizing interest income again only as cash interest payments are received and it has been determined that the collection of all outstanding principal is no longer in doubt. Loans may be restructured by management when a borrower has experienced some change in financial status causing an inability to meet the original repayment terms and where the Bank believes the borrower will eventually overcome those circumstances and make full repayment. OREO consists of properties acquired by foreclosure or similar means that management is offering or will offer for sale. Total OREO, net of OREO reserves, was $2.4 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $2.7 million at December 31, 2016.\nNonperforming Assets\nThe following table provides information about nonperforming assets by asset type as of December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Nonperforming Assets:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-accrual loans past due 30 days or more\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,179\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,927\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans past due 90 days or more still accruing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,946\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restructured loans past due 30 days - not included above\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other Real Estate Owned, gross\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,466\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,746\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Nonperforming Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,555\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table provides information about nonperforming loans by loan type:\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Nonperforming Loans:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial & industrial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial mortgage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial construction\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial agriculture\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total commercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Residential mortgage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Home equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Automobile\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other consumer 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total consumer\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,999\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total nonperforming loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,809\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n Comprised of other revolving and installment credit and overdrafts. \nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe Bank maintains its allowance for loan losses at a level which, in management's judgment, is adequate to absorb prospective credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The amount of the allowance is based on management's evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio, including the nature and volume of the portfolio, credit concentrations, trends in historical loss experience, the level of certain classified and impaired loans, and economic conditions, along with their related impacts on specific borrowers and industry groups. The allowance is increased by provisions for loan losses, which are charged against earnings, and reduced by charge-offs, net of recoveries. Because of uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, management's estimate of potential credit losses in the loan portfolio and the related allowance may change from time to time.\nThe Bank's allowance for loan losses increased by $1.8 million to $17.3 million during 2017 from $15.4 million at the end of 2016. The increase in the allowance for loan losses in 2017 was based primarily on the growth in our loan portfolio, particularly in consumer loans, and management's periodic reevaluation of the overall portfolio's inherent risk. The Bank had $7.3 million in charge-offs in 2017, which were partially offset by loan recoveries of $1.6 million.\nNet loans charged-off includes the realization of losses in the portfolio that were partially recognized previously through provisions for loan losses and write-downs of loan principal valuations. Net charge-offs were $5.7 million in 2017, more than double the net charge-offs of $2.6 million in 2016. The 2017 net was higher primarily due to higher charge-offs in the consumer loan portfolio. Historical net loan charge-offs are not necessarily indicative of the amount of net charge-offs that the Bank will realize in the future.\nThe table in Note 6 - Loans, under Credit Quality Indicators, provides a summary of the allocation of the allowance for loan losses for specific categories at the dates indicated. The allocation presented should not be interpreted as an indication that charges to the allowance for loan losses will be incurred in these amounts or proportions, or that the portion of the allowance allocated to each category represents the total amount available for charge-offs that may occur within these categories.\nAllocation of Loan Loss Allowance\nThe material set forth in Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K is incorporated by reference.\nDeposits\nThe composition and cost of the Bank's deposit base are important components in analyzing the Bank's net interest margin and balance sheet liquidity characteristics, both of which are discussed in greater detail in other sections in this report. The Bank's liquidity is impacted by the volatility of deposits or other funding instruments or, in other words, by the propensity of that money to leave the institution for interest rate-related or other reasons. Deposits can be adversely affected if economic conditions in the Bank's market area weaken. Potentially, the most volatile deposits in a financial institution are jumbo certificates of deposit, meaning time deposits with balances that equal or exceed $250,000, as customers with balances of that magnitude are typically more rate-sensitive than customers with smaller balances.\nThe following table summarizes the distribution of deposits for the periods indicated:\nTable 77: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-interest bearing deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 508,149\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 469,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest bearing deposits:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Demand deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 288,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 346,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Regular savings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 713,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 669,957\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Time deposits:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $250,000 or more\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,528\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33,697\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less than $250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,832\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other interest bearing deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 264,844\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 234,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total interest bearing deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,307,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,309,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,816,132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,778,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Bank gathers deposits from among the communities it serves. The Bank's business is not generally seasonal in nature, and the Bank is not primarily dependent upon funds from sources outside the United States of America, but approximately 27.1% of its deposit base at December 31, 2017, is acquired in the Micronesian islands that are politically organized in free association with the United States and use the U.S. dollar as their currency. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, 35.1% and 34.1% of deposits were from domestic and foreign government sources.\nNon-interest and low interest-bearing demand deposits decreased by $19.2 million, or 2.4%, to $797.1 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $816.4 million at December 31, 2016. Other interest bearing deposits, which are comprised of time deposit open accounts, increased by $30.6 million, or 13.1%, to $264.8 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $234.3 million at December 31, 2016.\nAs mentioned earlier, the Bank has expanded its operations and its branch network since it first opened in 1972, first in Guam, then in the other islands of our region and in San Francisco, California. As time has passed, the Bank has gathered market share in each of the islands. In recent years, in order to diversify its geographic market, the Bank has increased its focus on growth in the San Francisco area. The following table provides figures for deposits in the Bank's administrative regions for the years ending December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017:\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> At December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Guam\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 824,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 975,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 936,237\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 234,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 319,895\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 343,149\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> The Freely Associated States of Micronesia *\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 314,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 431,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 491,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> California\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 49,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 51,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,422,671\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,778,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,816,132\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n * The Freely Associated States are comprised of the Federated States of Micronesia (Chuuk, Kosrae, Pohnpei and Yap), the Republic of Palau and the Republic of the Marshall Islands. \nDuring 2017, deposits increased by a total of $37.5 million, of which $59.4 million was in the Bank's Freely Associated States branches and $23.3 million was in our Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands branches, but decreased in our Guam branches by $39.3million and in California by $5.9 million. Overall, the Bank's deposit base increased by 2.1% during 2017, after rising by 25.0% during 2016. Deposits decreased in the California region by 11.5% in the year ended December 31, 2017, after increasing by 4.7% the previous year as a reversal of gradual, moderate growth in that market.\nDeposit Maturity Distribution\nAt December 31, 2017, the scheduled maturities of time deposits were as follows:\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td> Years ending December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 35,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2022 and thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 40,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Bank provides and services government and business deposit accounts that are frequently more than $250,000 in average balance per account. The account activity for some account types and client types necessitates appropriate liquidity management practices by the Bank to ensure its ability to fund withdrawals.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn the normal course of business, the Bank makes commitments to extend credit to its customers as long as there are no violations of any conditions established in the associated contractual arrangements. These commitments are obligations that represent a potential credit risk to the Bank, yet are not reflected in any form within the Company's consolidated balance sheets other than in a modest contingency reserve against those commitments. Total unused commitments to extend credit were $159.8 million at December 31, 2017, as compared to $152.6 million at December 31, 2016. Unused commitments represented 13.0% of outstanding gross loans at both December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nThe effect on the Bank's revenues, expenses, cash flows and liquidity from the unused portion of the commitments to provide credit cannot be reasonably predicted, because there is no certainty that these lines of credit will ever be fully utilized, if at all. For more information regarding the Company's off-balance sheet arrangements, see Note 16 to the financial statements located elsewhere herein.\nThe following table presents the Bank's commitments to extend credit for the periods indicated:\nTable 81: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commitments to extend credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 159,767\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 152,585\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Letters of credit:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Standby letters of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 54,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 52,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial letters of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,601\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 57,308\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 55,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nContractual Obligations\nThe Bank utilizes facilities, equipment and land under various operating leases with original terms ranging from 1 to 99 years. Some of these leases include scheduled rent increases. The total amount of the rent is being expensed on the straight-line method over the lease terms. The Bank has recorded a deferred obligation of $988 thousand and $926 thousand as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which has been included within other liabilities, to reflect the excess of rent expense over cash paid on the leases.\nAt December 31, 2017, annual lease commitments under the above noncancelable operating leases were as follows:\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td> Years ending December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,797\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,712\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,351\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2022 and Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 28,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Bank leases certain facilities from two separate entities in which two of its directors have separate ownership interests. Lease payments made to these entities during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 approximated $329 thousand, $379 thousand and $370 thousand, respectively.\nAdditionally, the Bank leases office space to third parties, with original lease terms ranging from 3 to 5 years and option periods ranging up to 15 years. At December 31, 2017, minimum future rents to be received under non-cancelable operating sublease agreements were $46 thousand, $13 thousand, $0 thousand and $0 thousand for the years ending December 31, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Although it is possible that one or more of these leases will be renewed, there is no certainty upon which to base an estimate.\nA summary of rental activities for years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, is as follows:\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rent expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,852\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,480\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: sublease rentals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net rent expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,206\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Asset/Liability Management\nLiquidity refers to the Bank's ability to maintain cash flows sufficient to fund operations and to meet obligations and other commitments in a timely and cost-effective fashion. At various times the Bank requires funds to meet short-term cash requirements brought about by loan growth or deposit outflows, the purchase of assets, or liability repayments. The Bank's large base of core deposits is an integral part of its ability to manage its liquidity position appropriately. These core deposits are generated by offering traditional banking services in its service areas and have, historically, been a stable source of funds. To manage liquidity needs properly, cash inflows must be timed to coincide with anticipated outflows, or other sufficient liquid resources must be available to meet varying demands. The Bank manages cash and investment securities in order to be able to meet unexpected, sudden changes in levels of its assets or deposit liabilities without maintaining excessive amounts of balance sheet liquidity. Excess balance sheet liquidity can negatively impact the Bank's interest margin. In order to meet short-term liquidity needs, the Bank may utilize overnight Federal Funds purchases and other borrowing arrangements with correspondent banks, and use interest rate pricing to attract new deposits from local sources; it also maintains collateralized lines of credit with the FHLB and the FRB. In addition, the Bank can obtain cash for temporary needs by selling securities that it classifies as Available-for-Sale.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Bank had an increase in gross loans of $53.9 million from December 31, 2016, funded in part by the $37.5 million increase in its deposit base and in part by a reduction of $48.1 million in its total cash and cash equivalents. One of the measures of liquidity is our loan-to-deposit ratio, based upon gross loans, which increased to 67.7% at December 31, 2017, compared to 66.1% at December 31, 2016. Each calendar quarter, the Bank performs a six-month cash flow analysis to ensure that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet all of its potential cash obligations under a worst-case scenario, and maintains more than adequate liquidity under those hypothetical conditions.\nFHLB, FRB and Other Borrowings and Available Lines of Credit\nThe Bank has off-balance sheet liquidity in the form of Federal Funds purchase arrangements with correspondent banks, as well as collateralized borrowing arrangements with the FHLB and the FRB. The Bank can borrow from the FHLB on a short-term (typically overnight) or long-term (more than one year) basis. At December 31, 2017, the Bank had no long-term borrowings. The Bank had an available line of credit of $121.4 million with the FHLB of Des Moines at December 31, 2017.\nThe Bank can also borrow from the FRB's discount window. It had $21.5 million of investment securities pledged to the FRB San Francisco as collateral on an available line of credit of $20.9 million at December 31, 2017, none of which credit was outstanding.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Bank had arrangements for Federal Funds purchases of up to $17.0 million from three of its U.S. correspondent financial institutions. The Bank had no Federal Funds purchases outstanding at December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company had no other borrowed funds.\nCapital Resources\nThe Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the United States federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Bank's consolidated financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of its assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items, as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.\nQuantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the following table) of total, Tier 1 and common equity Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined) and of Tier 1 capital (as defined) to average assets (as defined). The common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio was newly required effective January 1, 2015. Management believes, as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, that the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the most recent notification from the FDIC categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well capitalized, an institution must maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the following table. There are no conditions or events since the notification that management believes have changed the Bank's category. The Bank's actual capital amounts and ratios as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, are also presented in the table.\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Actual\n</td> <td>\n</td>

instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments. Market risk is an attribute of\nall market risk sensitive financial instruments, including securities, loans, deposits and borrowings, as well as a company's role as a financial intermediary in customer-related transactions. The objective of market risk management is to avoid excessive exposure of the company's earnings and equity to loss, and to reduce the volatility inherent in certain types of financial instruments.\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nMarket risk arises from changes in interest rates, exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. The Bank's market risk exposure is primarily that of interest rate risk, and it has established policies and procedures to monitor and limit earnings and balance sheet exposure to changes in interest rates. The Bank does not engage in the trading of financial instruments, and has only nominal direct exposure to currency exchange rate risk, but has indirect exposure to exchange rate risk because of the dominant position of foreign tourism in its primary markets.\nThe principal objective of interest rate risk management (often referred to as asset/liability management\u201d) is to manage the financial components of the Bank's balance sheet, as well as their characteristics, in a manner that will optimize the risk/reward equation for earnings and capital in relation to changing interest rates. The Bank's exposure to market risk is reviewed on a monthly basis by its Asset and Liability Committee. Interest rate risk is the potential for economic losses due to future interest rate changes. These economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and/or a loss of current fair market values. The objective is to measure the effect on net interest income and to adjust the balance sheet to minimize the inherent risk while simultaneously maximizing income. Management realizes certain risks are inherent, and that the goal is to identify and manage those risks. Management uses two methodologies to manage interest rate risk: (i) a standard GAP analysis; and (ii) an interest rate shock simulation model.\nThe planning of asset and liability maturities is an integral part of the management of an institution's net interest margin. To the extent that the maturities of assets and liabilities do not match in a changing interest rate environment, the net interest margin may change over time. Even with perfectly matched re-pricing of assets and liabilities, risks remain in the form of prepayment risk for some loans and securities, or in the form of risks of delays in the adjustment of interest rates applying to either earning assets with floating rates or to interest bearing liabilities. The Bank has generally been able to control its exposure to changing interest rates by maintaining a substantial proportion of its portfolio in floating interest rate loans and a majority of its time deposits with relatively short maturities.\nInterest rate changes do not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or at the same time. Varying interest rate environments can create unexpected changes in prepayment levels of assets and liabilities, which may have a significant effect on the net interest margin and are not reflected in the interest sensitivity analysis table. Because of these factors, an interest sensitivity gap report may not provide a complete assessment of the exposure to changes in interest rates.\nThe Bank uses modeling software for asset/liability management in order to simulate the effects of potential interest rate changes on its net interest margin, and to calculate the estimated fair values of the Bank's financial instruments under different interest rate scenarios. The program utilizes current balances, interest rates, maturity dates and re-pricing information for individual financial instruments, and incorporates assumptions on the characteristics of embedded options along with pricing and duration for those instruments to project the effects of a given interest rate change on the Bank's interest income and interest expense. Rate scenarios consisting of key rate and yield curve projections are run against the Bank's investment, loan, deposit and borrowed funds portfolios. These rate projections can be shocked (an immediate and parallel change in all base rates, up or down) and ramped (with incremental increases or decreases in rates over a specified time period), based on current trends and forecasts, including stable economic conditions.\nThe following table sets forth the estimated changes in the Bank's net interest income that would result from the designated instantaneous parallel shifts in interest rates noted, as of December 31, 2017. Computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions, including relative levels of market interest rates, loan prepayments and deposit decay, and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. (Please note that, in the current interest rate environment, the larger reductions in rates presented in the analysis are unlikely to occur.)\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase/(Decrease) in Estimated Net Interest\nIncome\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in Interest Rates (basis points)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 31,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38.04\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28.56\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.93\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.37\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u00b1 0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.00\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (7,640\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -9.34\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (13,180\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -16.11\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (15,674\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -19.16\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (18,075\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -22.10\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese data do not reflect any actions that we may undertake in response to changes in interest rates, such as changes in rates paid on certain deposit accounts based on local competitive factors, which could improve or attenuate the actual impact on net interest income.\nAs with any method of gauging interest rate risk, there are certain shortcomings inherent to the methodology noted above. The model assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous, and result in parallel shifts in the yield curve. In reality, rate changes are rarely instantaneous. The use of the simplifying assumption that short-term and long-term rates change by the same degree also disregards historic rate change patterns, which rarely show parallel yield curve shifts. Further, the model assumes that certain assets and liabilities of similar maturity or period to re-pricing will react in the same way to changes in rates. In reality, certain types of financial instruments may react in advance of changes in market rates, while the reaction of other types of financial instruments may lag significantly behind the change in general market rates. Additionally, the methodology noted above does not reflect the full impact of annual and lifetime restrictions on changes in rates for certain assets, such as adjustable rate loans. When interest rates change, actual loan prepayments and actual early withdrawals from time certificates may deviate significantly from the assumptions used in the model. Finally, this methodology does not measure or reflect the impact that higher rates may have on adjustable-rate loan clients' ability to service their debt. All of these factors are considered in less formulaic ways in monitoring the Bank's exposure to interest rate risk.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nGeneral\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP\u201d). The financial information contained within our consolidated financial statements is, to a significant extent, based on approximate measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred. A variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained, either when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset or relieving a liability. In certain instances, we use a discount factor and prepayment assumptions to determine the present value of assets and liabilities. A change in the discount factor or prepayment speeds could increase or decrease the values of those assets and liabilities, which would result in either a beneficial or adverse impact to our financial results. We use historical loss factors as one factor in determining the inherent loss that may be present in our loan portfolio. Actual losses could differ significantly from the historical factors that we use. Other estimates that we use are related to the realization of our deferred tax assets and the expected useful lives of our depreciable assets. In addition, GAAP itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another, although the economics of our transactions would remain the same.\nFair Value of Securities\nIn accordance with GAAP, the Bank revalues the Available-for-Sale component of its investment portfolio on a quarterly basis, and records any unrealized gain or loss as an adjustment to other comprehensive income in its equity accounts. Held-to-Maturity securities are recorded at their amortized book value. The Bank also evaluates whether any of its security holdings are Other Than Temporarily Impaired ( OTTI\u201d), but has determined that, as of December 31, 2017, none of its securities are deemed to be OTTI.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the potential losses in our loan portfolio. Our accounting for estimated loan losses was previously discussed in this Item 7 under the heading, Allowance for Loan Losses.\u201d\nDeferred Tax Assets\nOur net deferred income tax asset arises from temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities reported in the financial statements and the amounts used for income tax return purposes. Our accounting for Deferred Tax Assets was previously discussed under the heading Income Tax Expense\u201d.\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion And Analysis Of Financial Condition And Results Of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following discussion provides information about the results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and capital resources of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, the Bank. This information is intended to facilitate the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to our financial condition and the results of operations. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nExecutive Summary\nThis summary is intended to identify the most important matters on which management focuses when it evaluates the financial condition and performance of the Bank. When evaluating financial condition and performance, management looks at certain key\nmetrics and measures. The Bank's evaluation includes comparisons with peer group financial institutions and its own performance objectives established in internal planning processes.\nThe primary activity of the Bank is commercial banking, as it has been since the Bank opened in Guam in 1972. The Company's operations are located entirely in the U.S. territories, the U.S.-affiliated nations of the western Pacific, and in the San Francisco Bay area of California. The largest community in the Bank's western Pacific market is Guam, followed by the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. The market includes a number of transportation-, travel- and tourism-related companies in the region, as well as substantial U.S. Department of Defense and other U.S. federal government activities in Guam. The Company's customers are primarily transnational corporations, governments, closely-held businesses and individuals.\nDuring 2017, there were four significant factors that impacted the Company's financial condition and operations:\n \u2022 Over the course of the year, tourist arrivals continued to increase in Guam and other islands in the region. In Guam, the number of visitors reached its highest level in history, at 1.54 million. This was due, in part, to the fact that a moderate, 3.5% decrease in Japanese arrivals was more than offset by increasing arrivals from South Korea and China, with the latter two increasing by 27.4% and 14.0%, respectively. The continuing growth in Guam's tourism industry and increasing arrivals in the other islands led to modest improvements in payroll employment and other aspects of the regional economy, enhancing the Bank's business. \n \u2022 The military buildup continues, and substantial funding is finally being provided for the relocation of U.S. Marines from Okinawa to Guam. Several contracts, totaling hundreds of millions of dollars, were executed during 2017, and additional years of construction and related activity are expected to bring additional investment and income to Guam. Once completed, the activities that these projects support will provide a sustained contribution to the economy. \n \u2022 The continuing strength of the economy in the San Francisco Bay area provided ample opportunities to expand the Bank's business there, leading to an increase of 16.0% in the California region's loan portfolio, supplementing 22.6% growth in loans in the Freely Associated States of Micronesia markets and supporting overall growth of 4.6% in the total loan portfolio, as loans in Guam decreased by 2.2%. The 2.2% growth in the Bank's asset base supported a 4.6% expansion of our gross loan portfolio and an increase of 6.7% in our investment portfolio as we also converted $50.5 million of our cash and cash equivalents to higher yielding assets. \n \u2022 The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of December 2017 caused the Company to reevaluate the valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets. The decrease in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% decreased the likelihood that we will be able to use a large portion of those deferred tax assets in a future period, so a write-down of $2.7 million was applied to our 2017 Income Statement, as reflected there and in our Statement of Financial Condition. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net income attributable to common stockholders was $8.0 million, or $0.86 per diluted common share. For the year ended December 31, 2016, net income was $13.5 million, or $1.46 per diluted common share. For the year ended December 31, 2015, net income was $11.3 million, or $1.25 per diluted common share.\nThe returns on average assets and average equity for the year ended December 31, 2017, were 0.44% and 6.24%, respectively, compared to 0.77% and 11.22%, respectively, for 2016, and 0.74% and 10.50%, respectively, for 2015.\nThe following are major factors that impacted the Company's results of operations:\n \u2022 Net interest income increased 8.3% to $79.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $73.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, due to a $6.1 million increase in interest income that was partially offset by an increase of $52 thousand in interest expense. Net interest income increased by 8.1% to $73.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $67.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, due to a $5.7 million increase in interest income that was partially offset by an increase of $249 thousand in interest expense. \n \u2022 The net interest margin decreased 16 basis points to 4.24% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with 4.39% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in the net interest margin for 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to an eight basis point decrease in the average yields on loans, partially offset by a 23 basis point increase in the average yield on our securities portfolio and a 40 basis point increase in the average yield on our deposits with other financial institutions; the average rates that we paid on deposits decreased by 0.4 basis points. Despite the decrease in the overall average yield of 16 basis points on our total earning assets, higher loan and investment volumes generated higher interest income that more than offset the higher gross amount of interest paid on our customers' deposits. \n \u2022 The provision for loan losses was $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, $3.6 million higher than the provision during 2016. The 2017 provision was increased to reflect the growth of $53.9 million in our loan portfolio as our emphasis shifted moderately from commercial to consumer loans, and is deemed by management to provide a \n sufficient allowance for loan losses due to net losses of $5.7 million during the year. The provision for loan losses was $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was $600 thousand lower than the provision during the previous year. The provision for loan losses was $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, including $12 thousand assigned to the reserve for off-balance sheet risk. \n \u2022 Non-interest income was $16.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, $2.7 million more than the $13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in non-interest income in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to increases of $2.5 million in trustee fees, $792 thousand in service charges and fees, $314 thousand in net income from merchant services and a $257 thousand increase in other income, partially offset by an $813 thousand decrease in net cardholder income, and a reduction of $397 thousand in our realized gain on the sale of investment securities. Non-interest income was $13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, $2.9 million more than the $11.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in non-interest income in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to increases of $1.2 million in net income from merchant services, $911 thousand from service charges and fees, $328 thousand in trustee fees, $325 thousand in net gains on investment securities and $265 thousand in other income, partially offset by a reduction of $134 thousand in net income from cardholders. The increase in merchant income was the result of a correction of accumulated billing errors by our card processor. \n \u2022 Non-interest expense was $70.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $64.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase of 9.7%, primarily due to an increase of $2.6 million in salaries and employee benefits, an additional $1.7 million in equipment and depreciation expense, a rise of $1.0 million in general, administrative and other expenses, and a $400 thousand increase in occupancy expense. Non-interest expense was $64.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $59.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of 8.6% was primarily due to an increase of $3.1 million in salaries and employee benefits, an additional $1.3 million in general, administrative and other expenses, and a rise of $807 thousand in equipment and depreciation expense. These increases were partially offset by a reduction of $264 thousand in the expense associated with other real estate that we owned, primarily foreclosed properties. \n \u2022 The 37.0% decrease of net after tax income to $8.5 million in 2017 compared to $13.6 million 2016 was due to the $6.2 million increase in non-interest expense, the $3.9 million increase in income tax expense and the $3.6 million increase in our provision for loan losses, offset by the $6.1 million increase in total interest income. The 20.0% increase of net after tax income to $13.6 million in 2016 compared to $11.3 million in 2015 was due to the $5.5 million increase in net interest income and the $2.9 million increase in non-interest income, offset by the $5.1 million increase in non-interest expense and the increase of $1.7 million in income taxes. \nThe following are important factors in understanding our current financial condition and liquidity position:\n \u2022 Cash, interest-bearing deposits in other banks, and investment securities available-for-sale collectively decreased by $9.6 million (1.2%), to $586.9 million, at December 31, 2017, from $596.5 million at December 31, 2016. This decrease in liquid assets is due to a decrease of $53.8 million in interest bearing deposits in banks, partially offset by a $40.9 million increase in available-for-sale securities and a $3.3 million increase in cash. \n \u2022 Total assets increased by $44.4 million (2.3%) from $1.92 billion at December 31, 2016, to $1.97 billion at December 31, 2017. This increase was composed of a $51.8 million or 4.5% increase in total loans (net of deferred fees and the allowance for loan losses), to $1.21 billion at December 31, 2017, compared to $1.16 billion at December 31, 2016, an increase of $40.9 million in available-for-sale securities and growth in other assets of $7.1 million, partially offset by a decrease of $50.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, from $176.7 million at December 31, 2016, to $126.1 million at December 31, 2017, and a decrease of $6.5 million in held-to-maturity securities during the same period. The increase in loans was primarily attributable to an increase of $41.4 million in gross consumer loans, to $409.9 million at the end of 2017 compared to $368.5 million a year earlier, and an increase of $12.5 million in gross commercial loans, to $820.0 million at December 31, 2017, from $807.5 million at December 31, 2016. In support of the growth of total assets, total liabilities increased by $38.4 million, to $1.83 billion at December 31, 2017, based upon the addition of $37.5 million in total deposits from the previous year end, and an increase of $5.9 million in total stockholders' equity, to $138.1 million, composed of the $4.3 million increase in retained earnings and $1.6 million in additional paid-in common stock. \n \u2022 Classified assets increased to $32.3 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $20.6 million at December 31, 2016. \n \u2022 The allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2017, was $17.3 million, or 1.40% of total gross loans. The allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2016, was $15.4 million, or 1.31% of total gross loans. \n \u2022 Nonperforming loans increased by $1.3 million to $8.1 million, or 0.66% of total gross loans, at December 31, 2017, from $6.8 million, or 0.58% of total gross loans, at December 31, 2016. \n \u2022 Net loan charge-offs were $5.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the $2.6 million in net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2016. \n \u2022 The ratio of noncore funding of $16.5 million (which consists of $250,000 and over time deposits plus short-term borrowings) to total assets was 0.84% at December 31, 2017, compared to $33.7 million, or 1.75% of total assets, at December 31, 2016. \n \u2022 The loan-to-deposit ratio increased to 67.7% at December 31, 2017, as compared to 66.1% at December 31, 2016, due to total gross loan growth of $53.9 million far exceeding the $37.5 million increase in deposits. \n \u2022 Capital ratios significantly exceed regulatory requirements for a well-capitalized financial institution, both at the Company level and in the Bank. The leverage ratio of the Company was 7.19%, with a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 11.58%, a total risk-based capital ratio of 12.83%, and a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 10.78% at December 31, 2017. The leverage ratio at the Company was 7.30%, with a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 11.74%, a total risk-based capital ratio of 12.99% and a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 10.89% at December 31, 2016. The leverage ratio at the Bank was 6.97%, with a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 11.24%, a total risk-based capital ratio of 12.49%, and a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 10.83% at December 31, 2017. The leverage ratio at the Bank was 7.06%, with a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 11.36%, a total risk-based capital ratio of 12.61% and a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 10.93% at December 31, 2016. The regulatory well-capitalized guidelines are a minimum of a 5% leverage ratio, a 8% Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, a 10% total risk-based capital ratio, and a 6.5% common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio. The changes in our capital ratios from December 31, 2016, to December 31, 2017, were due to the retention of $4.3 million in earnings during 2017, along with the issuance of common stock in the amount of $1.6 million. \nDeposits\nThe composition and cost of the Bank's deposit base are important in analyzing the Bank's net interest margin and balance sheet liquidity characteristics. The Bank's depositors are generally located in its primary market area. Depending on loan demand and other funding requirements, the Bank also attracts deposits through its interest rate pricing. The Bank monitors all deposits that may be sensitive to interest rate changes to help ensure that liquidity risk does not become excessive due to deposit migration. Deposits at December 31, 2017, were $1.82 billion, compared to $1.78 billion at December 31, 2016. The 2.1% increase was primarily due to the acquisition of additional government and commercial accounts in the Freely Associated States, U.S. government payments for land use and other purposes, and the growth in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands' tourism sector and general economic recovery, partially offset by decreases in the Bank's deposits in the Guam and in the California region.\nThe Bank does not currently accept brokered deposits because it already maintains ample liquidity.\nLiquidity\nOur liquidity position refers to our ability to maintain cash flows sufficient to fund operations and to meet obligations and other commitments in a timely fashion. We believe that the Bank's liquidity position is more than sufficient to meet our operating expenses, borrowing needs and other obligations for 2018, and management has tested and determined that, even under severely stressed scenarios, the Bank's liquidity will be more than adequate to meet our requirements. Our liquidity increased substantially during 2017. Once the increases in our loan portfolio and other assets were accommodated, the increases in our liabilities and equity were channeled into short-term earning assets as a defensive measure due to historically low interest rates and yields, and the possibility that those rates and yields will increase further as the U.S. economy continues to improve. At December 31, 2017, we had $126.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately $159.3 million in available borrowing capacity from various sources, including the Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB\u201d), the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco ( FRB\u201d), and Federal Funds facilities with several financial institutions. The Bank also had $245.9 million in unpledged securities available at December 31, 2017. Our loan-to-deposit ratio increased to 67.7% at December 31, 2017, compared to 66.1% at December 31, 2016, as our gross loans increased by 4.6% and our deposits grew by 2.1%.\nLending\nOur loans originate almost entirely through the branch offices located in our primary market. As the Bank approached a saturation point in our island service area, we expanded our activities in California through our branch in San Francisco. The total loan portfolio remains well diversified with commercial and industrial loans accounting for 20.8% and commercial real estate loans accounting for 45.8% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2017. Construction loans rose from 0.5% of the portfolio at December 31, 2016, to 0.8% at December 31, 2017. Residential mortgages and other consumer-related loans accounted for the remaining 33.3% of total loans at December 31, 2017. The increase in gross loans in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to an increase of 11.2% in our\nconsumer loan portfolio, supplemented by growth of 1.6% in commercial loans. The Bank also had a decrease of $5.5 million in loans sold to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( Freddie Mac\u201d) from $211.0 million at December 31, 2016, to $205.5 million at December 31, 2017, but these loans are off-book, except for the value of the associated mortgage servicing rights. The Bank exercises careful selectivity with respect to the types of loans it chooses to originate.\nNet Interest Income\nThe management of interest income and expense is fundamental to the performance of the Company and the Bank. Net interest income, the difference between interest income and interest expense, is the largest component of the Bank's total revenue. Management closely monitors both total net interest income and the net interest margin (net interest income divided by average earning assets).\nThe Bank, through its asset and liability management policies and practices, as overseen by its Asset and Liability Committee, seeks to maximize net interest income without exposing itself to an excessive level of interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is managed by monitoring the pricing, maturity and repricing options of all classes of interest bearing assets and liabilities. This is discussed in more detail under Liquidity and Asset/Liability Management. In addition, as the market allows, we take measures and initiatives to improve our net interest margin, including increasing loan rates, maintaining interest rate floors on floating rate loans, reducing nonperforming assets, managing deposit interest rates and reducing higher-cost deposits.\nFrom January 22, 2008, through December 16, 2008, the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee reduced its target short-term interest rates by 325 basis points, to a range of 0.00% to 0.25%, in response to the credit crisis and economic downturn that resulted from the collapse in the U.S. housing market and the subsequent global recession. The target Federal Funds Rate was raised to a range of 0.25% to 0.50% on December 16, 2015, then again to a range of 0.50% to 0.75% on December 15, 2016. During 2017, the target Federal Funds Rate was increased by 25 basis points three times, on March 15, June 14 and December 13, ending in a target range from 1.25% to 1.50%. The increase in short-term rates will gradually affect the rates applicable to many of the Bank's loans. The increase in short-term interest rates raised the overall cost of interest bearing deposits, which represent the Bank's primary funding source, by 11.0% by the end of 2017, as they tend to re-price more slowly than floating rate loans. The continuing low level of short-term interest rates, including the prime rate, has significantly compressed the Bank's net interest margin, but that pressure is gradually being eased.\nManagement of Credit Risk\nWe continue to proactively identify, quantify and manage our problem loans. Early identification of problem loans and potential future losses helps enable us to resolve credit issues with potentially less risk and lower ultimate losses. We maintain an allowance for loan losses in an amount that we believe is adequate to absorb probable and projected incurred losses in the portfolio. While we strive to carefully monitor and manage credit quality and to identify loans that may be deteriorating, circumstances can change at any time that may result in future losses for loans included in the portfolio, that as of the date of the financial statements have not yet been identified as potential problem loans. Through established credit practices, we adjust the allowance for loan losses accordingly. However, because future events are uncertain, there may be loans that deteriorate, some of which could occur in an accelerated time frame. As a result, future additions to the allowance may be necessary. Because the loan portfolio contains a number of commercial loans, commercial real estate and construction loans with relatively large balances, deterioration in the credit quality of one or more of these loans may require a significant increase to the allowance for loan losses. Future additions to the allowance may also be required based on changes in the financial condition of borrowers, such as have resulted due to changing economic conditions. Additionally, federal and local banking regulators throughout our market area, as an integral part of their supervisory function, periodically review our allowance for loan losses. These regulatory agencies may require us to recognize further loan loss provisions or charge-offs based upon their judgments, which may be different from ours. Any increase in the allowance for loan losses may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.\nWe also maintain a reserve against potential credit risks associated with our unfunded off-balance sheet loan commitments.\nFurther discussion of the management of credit risk appears under Provision for Loan Losses\u201d and Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d.\nNon-Interest Income\nWhile net interest income remains the largest single component of total revenues, non-interest income is an important source, as well. In total, the Bank received $16.6 million in non-interest income during 2017, an increase of $2.7 million from the $13.9 million recorded for 2016, and $5.6 million more than the $11.0 million received in 2015. The increase from 2016 to 2017 was due in part to a $2.5 million increase in trustee fees, an increase of $792 thousand in service charges and fees, and a $314 thousand increase in net income from merchant services, partially offset by an $813 thousand decrease in net cardholders income, along with a $397 thousand\ndrop in our gains from the sale of investment securities. The increase in trustee fees was substantially based on the recovery of certain investment fees, the higher service charges and fees primarily came from a charge implemented against low-balance accounts and the institution of a fee for paper account statements, and the increase in merchant services income resulted from the growth of the portfolio and a decrease in cross-border fees, while the decrease in cardholders income resulted in part from the increase in fees and the lower gain on the sale of securities was caused by market price fluctuations.\nNon-Interest Expense\nManagement considers the control of operating expenses to be a critical element of the performance of the Company and the Bank. As in years past, the Bank has undertaken initiatives to contain its non-interest expense and improve its efficiency. Nevertheless, total non-interest expense was $70.4 million for year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $64.1 million for year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $6.2 million. This increase was largely the result of increasing costs associated with salaries and employee benefits, from $31.6 million in 2016 to $34.2 million in 2017, the rise in equipment and depreciation expense and higher general, administrative and other expenses, which increased by $1.7 million and $1.0 million, respectively. Operating expenses in 2016 were $5.1 million higher than in 2015, primarily due to increasing costs associated with salaries and employee benefits, from $28.5 million in 2015 to $31.6 million in 2016, higher general administrative and other expenses and the rise in equipment and depreciation expense, which increased by $1.3 million and $807 thousand, respectively. For both 2016 and 2017, the increases in operating expenses were primarily the result of organic growth in the size of the Bank.\nCapital Management\nAs part of its asset and liability management process, the Company continually assesses its capital position to take into consideration growth, expected earnings, risk profile and potential corporate activities that it may choose to pursue.\nDuring the past several years, the Bank's principal source of increases in capital has been retained earnings, supplemented by stock purchases through our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report for a description of the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Since the formation of the Company in 2011, though, the Bank's assets have grown by 78.2%, and those more traditional sources of additional capital have not kept pace.\nAlthough the Bank remains well capitalized\u201d by all four regulatory measures of capital adequacy, the Bank's Tier 1 ratio had been decreasing because of its rapid asset growth, primarily attributed to the substantial growth in customer deposits. Consequently, the Company placed an additional $2.8 million of its common stock as of December 31, 2015, placed $9.8 million in non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock during 2016 and offered up to an additional $20.0 million in common stock at a purchase price of $12.25 per common share commencing September 29, 2017. Of this latest offering, $1.3 million had been placed as of December 31, 2017.\nIn the 2015 and 2016 offerings, the Company issued its stock to certain \"accredited investors\" within the meaning of Rule 501 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), at a purchase price of $9.85 per common share in 2015 and a purchase price of $1,000.00 per preferred share in 2016 (the \"Offerings\"). These are restricted shares, which may not be resold for a period of two years. The terms of the offerings were set forth in their respective Stock Purchase Agreements, dated July 30, 2015, and September 28, 2016, entered into between the Company and each investor. A portion of the proceeds from the offerings was used to retire subordinated debt, while the remainder will allow the Company to support the continued organic growth of its banking subsidiary in its existing market areas and will enable us to further serve the needs of individuals and businesses in those markets.\nThe Company's common and preferred stock was offered and sold only to investors that met the \"accredited investor\" definition of Rule 501 of the Securities Act in reliance on the exemption from registration afforded under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and Rule 504 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. The common stock offered in the Offerings has not been registered under the Securities Act or state securities laws, and may not be offered or sold in the United States without being registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") or through an applicable exemption from SEC registration requirements.\nResults of Operations\nThe Bank earns income from two primary sources. The first is net interest income, which is interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities. The second is non-interest income, which primarily consists of service charges and fees, income from merchants for processing credit and debit card transactions, non-interest income from holders of the Bank's credit cards, trustee fees and net investment securities gains. The majority of the Company's non-interest expenses are operating costs that relate to providing a full range of banking services to our customers.\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\nThe level of net interest income depends on several factors in combination, including earning assets, yields on earning assets, the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, and the relative volumes of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. To maintain its net interest margin, the Bank must manage the relationship between interest earned and interest paid.\nDistribution, Rate and Yield\nThe following Distribution, Rate and Yield table presents the average amounts outstanding during 2017 and 2016 for the major categories of the Company's balance sheet, the average interest rates earned or paid thereon, and the resulting net interest margin on average interest earning assets for the periods indicated. Average balances are based on monthly averages.\n\n Includes interest bearing deposit balances we maintain with other financial institutions and the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. \n Includes all investment securities in the Available-for-Sale and the Held-to-Maturity classifications. \n Includes average balances of non-accrual loans. \nThe Distribution, Rate and Yield table above sets forth the dollar amounts in interest earned and paid for each major category of interest earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for the noted periods, as well as their respective yields and costs, and the resulting interest rate spreads and net interest margins.\nThe Bank's net interest margin, expressed as a percentage of average earning assets, was 4.24% for 2017, down 15 basis points from 4.39% for 2016, even though average earning assets increased by 12.0% during the year, from $1.67 billion in 2016 to $1.87 billion in 2017. The primary reason for the decrease in the net interest margin was that our funding cost increased by 11.0%, from $2.0 million in 2016 to $2.2 million in 2017. Our average loan balances increased by $57.8 million, or 5.1%, but the average yield on the entire loan portfolio decreased by 9 basis points so that interest earnings on loans increased by only $2.5 million, or 3.6%. New loans made in a more competitive environment caused the decrease in the average yield on the loan portfolio. Yields on our investment securities portfolio increased by 23 basis points and the yield on short term investments went up by 40 basis points, but the yield on average earning assets decreased from 4.52% to 4.36% from 2016 to 2017. Average total interest-bearing liabilities increased by 13.5% during 2017, to $1.31 billion from $1.15 billion the previous year.\nNet interest income for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased by $5.9 million, to $79.5 million, compared to $73.4 million a year earlier, primarily due to an increase in interest income derived from the growth in our investment securities portfolio, supplemented by increases in earnings on average loan balances and our short term deposits in other banks, including the Federal\nReserve Bank of San Francisco. Net interest income for 2016 increased by $5.5 million from 2015, due to an increase of $5.7 million in interest income derived from the growth in average loan balances, a higher average investment portfolio and an increase in our average deposits with other banks, only slightly offset by an increase of $249 thousand in the interest that we paid on average deposit balances and other borrowed funds. The Bank's net interest margin was 4.40% in 2016, compared to 4.66% in 2015, a decrease of 26 basis points.\nA substantial portion of the Bank's earning assets are variable-rate loans that re-price when the Bank's reference rate, which usually corresponds with the New York prime lending rate, is changed. This is in contrast to a large base of core deposits that are generally slower to re-price. This causes the Bank's balance sheet to be liability-sensitive, which means that, all else being equal, net interest margin will be lower during periods when short-term interest rates are rising and higher when rates are falling. However, we will not necessarily have to raise rates on the personal savings portion of our core deposits as general market interest rates increase, mitigating the sensitivity of our net interest margin to rising interest rates.\nThe following table provides information regarding the changes in interest income and interest expense, attributable to changes in rates and changes in volumes that contribute to the total change in net interest income for the years ending December 31, 2017 and 2016. Variances attributable to both rate and volume changes are equal to the change in rate times the change in average balance and are included below in the average volume column.\n\nProvision for Loan Losses\nCredit risk is inherent in the lending business. The Bank establishes an allowance for loan losses through charges to earnings, which are shown in the statements of income as the provision for loan losses. Specifically identifiable and quantifiable known losses are promptly charged off against the allowance. The provision for loan losses is allocated monthly and evaluated quarterly through a determination of the adequacy of the Bank's allowance for loan losses, and reset if necessary, charging the shortfall, if any, to the current quarter's expense. This has the effect of creating variability in the amount and frequency of charges to the Bank's earnings. The provision for loan losses and level of allowance for each period are dependent upon many factors, including loan growth, net charge-offs, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio, delinquencies, management's assessment of the quality of the loan portfolio, the valuation of problem loans and the general economic conditions in the Bank's market area.\nFor 2017, the Bank had a provision for loan and credit losses of $7.5 million, which included $6 thousand assigned to the reserve for unfunded credit commitments. The remaining 2017 provision was $3.6 million more than the provision for 2016, and higher than the provision of $4.5 million for 2015. The 2017 provision was increased to reflect the growth of $53.9 million in our loan portfolio as our emphasis shifted moderately from commercial to consumer loans, and is deemed by management to provide a sufficient allowance for loan losses due to net losses of $5.7 million during the year, as well as to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that is adequate to absorb all reasonably expected future losses and to express management's perception of risk in the existing loan portfolio, as well as changes in the quality of that portfolio. The 2016 provision for loan losses decreased by $600 thousand compared to the $4.5 million provision during 2015.\nThe allowance for loan losses represented 1.40%, 1.31% and 1.44% of total gross loans at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operating income to bring the allowance for loan losses to a level deemed appropriate by the Bank based on the factors discussed under Allowance for Loan Losses.\u201d\nNon-interest income\nThe following table sets forth the various components of the Company's non-interest income:\n\nTotal non-interest income in 2017 was $2.7 million, or 19.2%, higher than in 2016, primarily because of increases of $2.5 million in trustee fees, $792 thousand in service charges and fees, $314 thousand in net income from merchant services and $257 thousand in other income, in part due to the implementation of a nominal fee for mailed paper account statements and in part to organic growth. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $813 thousand in net income from cardholders due to an increase in fees and a decline of $397 thousand in net gains on the sale of securities because of a less favorable interest rate environment. Other sources of non-interest income include loan servicing fees and income from the Bank-owned life insurance policies. The proportional composition of non-interest income remained relatively stable, with the increase in trustee fees and the decrease in net income from cardholders being the only changes exceeding 5.0% of the respective year's total from 2016 to 2017. Total non-interest income in 2016 was $2.9 million higher than in 2015, primarily because of a sharp increase of $1.2 million, or 133.4%, in income from merchant services due to the correction of accumulated billing errors by a vendor, the on-boarding of new merchant customers subsequent to the closure of a competing merchant services provider in Guam and an increase in net residuals that resulted from a reduction in cross-border fees; an increase of $911 thousand in service charges and fees that resulted from the full implementation of a fee to offset the costs of low-balance savings accounts; an increase of $328 thousand in trustee fees generated by increased revenue sharing in the higher interest rate environment; and a $325 thousand increase in net gains on the sale of investment securities.\nNon-interest expense\nThe following table sets forth the various components of the Company's non-interest expense:\n\nThe following table indicates the percentage of non-interest expense in each category:\n\nNon-interest expense totaled $70.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $6.2 million from $64.1 million in 2016. This increase is primarily attributed to the $2.6 million increase in salaries & employee benefits, up by 8.1% from the year ended December 31, 2016, due to merit raises and increases in some benefits expenses, as well as an increase in the number of employees necessary to accommodate the expansion and restructuring of the Bank's operations. In addition, our equipment and depreciation expense increased by $1.7 million, primarily due to the implementation of new technologies and increased information security expenses; general, administrative and other expenses increased by $1.0 million, and occupancy expense rose by $400 thousand.\nIn 2016, total non-interest expense increased by $5.1 million to $64.1 million, as compared to $59.0 million in 2015. This increase is primarily attributed to the $3.1 million increase in salaries & employee benefits, up by 11.0% from the year ended December 31, 2016, due to merit raises and increases in some benefits expenses, as well as an increase in the number of employees necessary to accommodate the expansion of the Bank's operations. In addition, general, administrative and other expenses increased by $1.3 million and our equipment and depreciation expense increased by $807 thousand. These increases were partially offset by modest decreases in the expenses associated with other real estate that is owned by the Bank, occupancy expense and contract services expense.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe Company computes its provision for income taxes on a monthly basis. The effective tax rate is determined by applying the Bank's statutory income tax rate to pre-tax book income, as adjusted for permanent differences between pre-tax book income and actual taxable income. These permanent differences include, but are not limited to, tax-exempt interest income, increases in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies, certain expenses that are not allowed as tax deductions, and tax credits.\nThe Bank pays income taxes in Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands under a territorial mirror\u201d of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, with payments made to the respective territorial governments instead of the U.S. Treasury; there is no equivalent of a state income tax in either of these jurisdictions. The Bank also pays taxes to the governments of the Republic of Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the State of California. The Bank's territorial and state income tax expense in 2017 was $9.6 million, as compared to an income tax expense of $5.7 million in 2016 and $4.1 million in 2015. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to a change in the valuation allowance for our deferred tax asset that resulted from the reduction in the maximum corporate income tax rate under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which became law on December 22, 2017, and which was only partially offset by the reduction in our net income before taxes.\nThe difference in the effective tax rate compared to the combined territorial, foreign and state statutory tax rate of 35% still in effect for 2017 is primarily the result of the Bank's portfolio of tax-exempt loans to the government of Guam totaling $25.9 million and $30.3 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nSome items of income and expense are recognized in different years for tax purposes than when applying generally accepted accounting principles, leading to timing differences between the Bank's actual tax liability and the amount accrued for this liability based on book income. These temporary differences comprise the deferred\u201d portion of the Bank's tax expense or benefit, which is accumulated on the Bank's books as a deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability until such time as they reverse. At the end of 2017 and 2016, the Bank had a gross deferred tax asset of $7.4 million and $11.3 million, respectively.\nRealization of the net deferred tax asset is primarily dependent upon the Bank generating sufficient taxable income to obtain a benefit from the reversal of net deductible temporary differences, utilization of tax credit carry-forwards and the net operating loss carry-forwards for Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and California state income tax purposes. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods based on estimates of future taxable income. Under generally accepted accounting principles, a valuation allowance is required to be recognized if it is more likely than not\u201d that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The determination of whether the deferred tax assets will actually be realized is highly subjective and dependent upon judgment concerning management's evaluation of both positive and negative evidence, including forecasts of future income, cumulative losses, applicable tax planning strategies, and assessments of current and future economic and business conditions.\nIn assessing the realization of deferred tax assets at December 31, 2017, based on these factors, the Bank believed that it was more likely than not that the Bank will realize only $5.5 million of the benefits of these deductible differences. Therefore, a valuation allowance of $2.0 million for its deferred tax asset was recorded at December 31, 2017.\nIn assessing the realization of deferred tax assets at December 31, 2016, the Bank believed that it was more likely than not that the Bank would realize only $8.1 million of the benefits of these deductible differences. Therefore, a valuation allowance of $3.2 million for the deferred tax asset was recorded at December 31, 2016.\nFinancial Condition\nAs of December 31, 2017, total assets were $1.97 billion, an increase of 2.3% from $1.92 billion at December 31, 2016. Total securities available-for-sale (at fair value) were $460.8 million, an increase of 9.7% from $419.9 million at December 31, 2016. The total loan portfolio, net of allowance for loan losses and deferred fees, was $1.21 billion, an increase of 4.5% from $1.16 billion at year-end 2016. Interest bearing deposits in banks were reduced by more than one third during 2017, falling to $97.1 million from $150.9 million at the end of 2016. Total deposits were $1.82 billion, an increase of 2.1% from $1.78 billion at year-end 2016. The Bank had no short-term borrowings at December 31, 2017.\nSecurities Portfolio\nThe following table reflects the estimated fair value of Available-for-Sale securities and the amortized cost of Held-to-Maturity securities, for each category for the past two years:\nInvestment Portfolio\n\nThe amortized cost and fair value of investment securities by contractual maturity at December 31, 2017, are shown below.\n\nThe securities portfolio is the second largest component of the Bank's interest earning assets, and the structure and composition of this portfolio is important to an analysis of the financial condition of the Bank and the Company. The portfolio serves the following\npurposes: (i) it provides a source of pledged assets for securing certain deposits and borrowed funds, as may be required by law or by specific agreement with a depositor or lender; (ii) it can be used as an interest rate risk management tool, since it provides a large base of assets, the maturity and interest rate characteristics of which can be changed more readily than the loan portfolio to better match changes in the deposit base and other funding sources of the Bank; and (iii) it is an alternative interest earning use of funds when loan demand is weak or when deposits grow more rapidly than loans.\nEighty-four percent of the Bank's securities at December 31, 2017, were classified under existing accounting rules as Available-for-Sale\u201d to allow flexibility in the management of the portfolio. Accounting guidance requires Available-for-Sale securities to be marked to fair market value, with an offset to other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders' equity, recorded on a quarterly basis. The remaining 16.3% of the investment portfolio was in Held-to-Maturity securities, which the Bank is willing and believes it will be able to retain until they mature, and which are recorded on an amortized cost basis.\nThe Bank's portfolio has historically been comprised primarily of: (i) U.S. government agency and sponsored entities' debt securities for liquidity and pledging; (ii) U.S. government agency and sponsored entities' mortgage-backed securities, which in many instances can also be used for pledging, and which generally enhance the yield of the portfolio; and (iii) U.S. government agency pool securities, which generally enhance the yield of the portfolio. Since the downgrade of many municipal obligations and their respective insurers in the past few years, the Bank no longer holds municipal bonds, but may do so again when markets become more stable.\nCompared to December 31, 2016, the Bank's securities portfolio increased by $34.4 million to 28.0% of total assets at December 31, 2017, from 26.9% at December 31, 2016. The Bank increased its holding of mortgage-back securities by $11.2 million to $107.2 million at December 31, 2017, from $96.0 million at December 31, 2016. During the same period, the Bank's holdings of U.S. government agency pool securities increased by $43.4 million, to $294.1 million, and its holdings of U.S. government agency and sponsored enterprise debt securities decreased by $20.1 million, to $149.2 million. The Bank has not used interest rate swaps or other derivative instruments to hedge fixed rate loans or securities to otherwise mitigate interest rate risk.\nLoans\nThe Bank's loans represent the largest portion of earning assets, substantially greater than the securities portfolio or any other asset category, and the quality and diversification of the loan portfolio is an important consideration when assessing the financial condition of the Bank and the Company.\nGross loans represented 62.6% of total assets at December 31, 2017, as compared to 61.2% at December 31, 2016. The ratio of gross loans to deposits increased to 67.7% at the end of 2017 from 66.1% at the end of 2016. Demand for loans has strengthened within the Bank's California, Freely Associated States and Northern Mariana Islands markets due to the improving economic environment, but the Bank has remained selective with respect to the types of loans it chooses to originate.\nThe Loan Distribution table that follows sets forth the Bank's gross loans outstanding, deferred fee income amortized over the life of some loans, the allowance for loan losses and the percentage distribution in each loan category at the dates indicated.\nLoan Portfolio\n\n Comprised of other revolving and installment credit and overdrafts. \nTwo-thirds of the Bank's loan portfolio is concentrated in commercial loans (which include loans to governments), primarily in commercial real estate, hotels and gas stations, with the balance in working capital and equipment financing. These are followed by other consumer loans and residential mortgages. The increase in the Bank's loan portfolio in 2017 was due to customary loan activity throughout our markets, the addition of several significant commercial loans in both the San Francisco and Guam regions, and consumer loan promotions. The Bank's gross loans were concentrated in Guam and San Francisco, at 87.8% of our net loan portfolio as of December 31, 2017, compared to 87.1% as of December 31, 2016. The only industry concentration that was considered significant at December 31, 2017, was within our commercial mortgage loan portfolio, which at 45.0% of total gross loans constituted a lower proportion than the 47.0% of total loans at the end of 2016.\nThe Bank's commercial & industrial loans are made for working capital, financing the purchase of equipment and other business purposes. Commercial loans include loans with maturities ranging from thirty days to one year and term loans\u201d with maturities normally ranging from three to ten years. Short- term business loans are generally intended to finance current transactions and typically provide for periodic principal payments, with interest payable monthly. Term loans normally carry floating interest rates, with monthly payments of both principal and interest, but may be amortized over a longer period than the term of the loan, with a balloon payment at the end of the term.\nThe Bank is an active participant in the Small Business Administration (SBA), State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI), Nor-Cal Financial Development Corp. and U.S. Department of Agriculture guaranteed lending programs, and has been approved by the SBA as a lender under the Preferred and Patriot Express Lender Programs. The Bank regularly makes such guaranteed loans and is frequently recognized as the largest originator of SBA loans in Guam, with an outstanding volume of $6.5 million at December 31, 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2017, commercial and residential real estate loans of $702.5 million consist primarily of adjustable and fixed rate loans secured by deeds of trust or mortgages on commercial and residential property, and comprised 57.1% of the total loan portfolio. The Bank's commercial mortgages at December 31, 2017, consist of $553.1 million, or 45.0% of gross loans. Commercial construction loans comprise $10.2 million, or 0.8%, of gross loans. Residential mortgages, including home equity loans, were $138.5 million, or 11.3%, of gross loans. Properties securing the commercial and residential real estate loans are located in the Bank's primary markets, which include the San Francisco Bay area.\nThe Bank's commercial real estate loans consist primarily of loans based on the borrower's cash flow and are secured by deeds of trust or mortgages on commercial and residential property to provide a secondary source of repayment. The Bank generally restricts commercial real estate term loans to no more than the lower of 75% of the property's appraised value or the purchase price of the property during the initial underwriting of the credit, depending on the type of property and its utilization. The Bank offers both fixed\nand floating rate loans. Maturities on commercial real estate loans are generally five years (with amortization up to twenty-five years and a balloon payment due at maturity), and maturities on residential mortgage loans are typically between 15 and 30 years, with many of those loans sold to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation with the retention of servicing rights. SBA and certain other real estate loans that can be sold in the secondary market may be granted for longer maturities.\nThe Bank's construction loans primarily finance the development and construction of commercial and residential properties. The Bank uses underwriting guidelines to assess the likelihood of repayment from sources such as sale of the property or availability of permanent mortgage financing prior to making the construction loan. Construction loans increased by $3.7 million to $10.2 million at December 31, 2017, from $6.4 million at December 31, 2016.\nAdditionally, the Bank makes consumer loans for the purpose of financing automobiles, various types of consumer goods, and other personal purposes. Consumer loans generally provide for the monthly payment of principal and interest. Most of the Bank's consumer loans are either unsecured, secured by the personal property being purchased or, in the case of home equity loans, real property.\nAt December 31, 2017, total gross loans increased by $53.9 million, or 4.6%, to $1.23 billion from $1.18 billion at December 31, 2016. The increase in loans was largely attributed to a $41.4 million increase in consumer loans to $409.9 million at December 31, 2017, from $368.5 million at December 31, 2016. This was primarily due to the rapid growth in other consumer loans, consisting of revolving and installment credit and overdrafts, which was the result a pre-approved loan campaign and holiday loan promotions. The increase was partially offset by a $6.0 million decrease in residential mortgages and a $308 thousand decline in automobile loans. Commercial loans increased by $12.5 million during 2017, from $807.5 million to $820.0 million, due to the $8.0 million increase in commercial & industrial loans, a $3.7 million rise in commercial construction loans, and the $853 thousand increase in commercial mortgage loans, all only slightly offset by the decrease of $31 thousand in the commercial agriculture loan category.\nAt December 31, 2017, loans outstanding were comprised of approximately 65.0% variable rate loans and 35.0% fixed rate loans.\nSince it first opened in 1972, the Bank has expanded its operations and its branch network, first in Guam, then in the other islands of our region and in San Francisco, California. In the interests of enhancing performance and stability through market and industry diversification, the Bank has increased its focus on growth in the San Francisco area in recent years, adding personnel with experience and expertise in the Bay Area. The following table provides figures for gross loans in the Bank's administrative regions for the years ending December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017:\n\n * The Freely Associated States are comprised of the Federated States of Micronesia (Chuuk, Kosrae, Pohnpei and Yap), the Republic of Palau and the Republic of the Marshall Islands. \nThe figures for 2015 and 2016 above have been updated from previous Annual Reports on Form 10-K to reflect their gross instead of their net amounts.\nAs the table indicates, the Bank's total gross loans increased by 4.6% during 2017 and by 9.8% during 2016. Total loans in California increased by $48.6 million, or 16.0%, accounting for 90.3% of total portfolio growth during 2017. Loan growth in the Freely Associated States of Micronesia was second, with growth at $17.2 million, or 32.0% of total loan growth, and outstanding loans in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands grew by $3.8 million, or 5.1% of total growth, whereas outstanding loan balances in Guam decreased by $15.8 million, primarily due to the repayment of a single, large commercial loan during the year. For the two years ended December 31, 2017, California accounted for 58.6% of total loan growth, while the Freely Associated States contributed 22.7%, Guam accounted for 14.8% and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands provided 3.9% of total gross loan portfolio growth during that two-year period. The economy in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands has been recovering at a more rapid pace, but loan growth there has not yet caught up.\nLoan Maturities\nThe following table presents the maturity distribution of the Bank's loans as of December 31, 2017. The table also shows the distribution of such loans between those with predetermined (fixed) interest rates and those with variable (floating) interest rates.\nFloating rates generally fluctuate with changes in the New York prime rate, as reflected in The Wall Street Journal, and the Bank of Guam prime rate.\n\nLoan Servicing\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, there were $205.5 million and $211.0 million, respectively, in Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation loans that were serviced by the Bank.\nLoan servicing rights are included in Accrued Interest Receivable and Other Assets on the consolidated balance sheets, and are reported at their estimated fair value.\nNonperforming Assets\nFinancial institutions generally have a certain level of exposure to credit quality risk, and could potentially receive less than a full return of principal and interest if a debtor becomes unable or unwilling to repay. Since loans are the most significant assets of the Bank and generate the largest portion of its revenues, the Bank's management of credit risk is focused primarily on loan quality.\nBanks have generally suffered their most severe earnings declines as a result of customers' inability to generate sufficient cash flow to service their debts, and/or downturns in national and regional economies and declines in overall asset values, including real estate prices.\nThe Bank's credit policies identify allowable geographic credit concentrations. In addition, these policies establish the Bank's underwriting standards and the methods of monitoring credit quality on an ongoing basis. The Bank's internal credit risk controls are focused on underwriting practices, credit originating procedures, training, risk management techniques, and familiarity with loan customers, as well as the relative diversity and geographic concentration of our loan portfolio.\nThe Bank's credit risk may also be affected by external factors, such as the level of interest rates, employment, general economic conditions, real estate values, and trends in particular industries or geographic markets. As an independent community bank serving a specific geographic area, the Bank must contend with the unpredictable changes in the general regional market and, particularly, primary local markets. The Bank's asset quality has been affected in the past by the impact of national and regional recessions, consumer bankruptcies, and depressed real estate values.\nNonperforming assets are comprised of the following: loans for which the Bank is no longer accruing interest; restructured loans that are more than 90 days past due; loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest (although they are generally placed on non-accrual when they become 90 days past due, unless they are both well-secured and in the process of revision or collection); and other real estate owned ( OREO\u201d) that is acquired through foreclosures. Management's classification of a loan as non-accrual\u201d is an indication that there is reasonable doubt as to the full recovery of principal or interest on the loan. At that point, the Bank stops accruing interest income, and reverses any uncollected interest that had previously been accrued. These loans may or may not be collateralized, and collection efforts are pursued. The Bank begins recognizing interest income again only as cash interest payments are received and it has been determined that the collection of all outstanding principal is no longer in doubt. Loans may be restructured by management when a borrower has experienced some change in financial status causing an inability to meet the original repayment terms and where the Bank believes the borrower will eventually overcome those circumstances and make full repayment. OREO consists of properties acquired by foreclosure or similar means that management is offering or will offer for sale. Total OREO, net of OREO reserves, was $2.4 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $2.7 million at December 31, 2016.\nNonperforming Assets\nThe following table provides information about nonperforming assets by asset type as of December 31, 2017 and 2016:\n\nThe following table provides information about nonperforming loans by loan type:\n\n Comprised of other revolving and installment credit and overdrafts. \nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe Bank maintains its allowance for loan losses at a level which, in management's judgment, is adequate to absorb prospective credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The amount of the allowance is based on management's evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio, including the nature and volume of the portfolio, credit concentrations, trends in historical loss experience, the level of certain classified and impaired loans, and economic conditions, along with their related impacts on specific borrowers and industry groups. The allowance is increased by provisions for loan losses, which are charged against earnings, and reduced by charge-offs, net of recoveries. Because of uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, management's estimate of potential credit losses in the loan portfolio and the related allowance may change from time to time.\nThe Bank's allowance for loan losses increased by $1.8 million to $17.3 million during 2017 from $15.4 million at the end of 2016. The increase in the allowance for loan losses in 2017 was based primarily on the growth in our loan portfolio, particularly in consumer loans, and management's periodic reevaluation of the overall portfolio's inherent risk. The Bank had $7.3 million in charge-offs in 2017, which were partially offset by loan recoveries of $1.6 million.\nNet loans charged-off includes the realization of losses in the portfolio that were partially recognized previously through provisions for loan losses and write-downs of loan principal valuations. Net charge-offs were $5.7 million in 2017, more than double the net charge-offs of $2.6 million in 2016. The 2017 net was higher primarily due to higher charge-offs in the consumer loan portfolio. Historical net loan charge-offs are not necessarily indicative of the amount of net charge-offs that the Bank will realize in the future.\nThe table in Note 6 - Loans, under Credit Quality Indicators, provides a summary of the allocation of the allowance for loan losses for specific categories at the dates indicated. The allocation presented should not be interpreted as an indication that charges to the allowance for loan losses will be incurred in these amounts or proportions, or that the portion of the allowance allocated to each category represents the total amount available for charge-offs that may occur within these categories.\nAllocation of Loan Loss Allowance\nThe material set forth in Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K is incorporated by reference.\nDeposits\nThe composition and cost of the Bank's deposit base are important components in analyzing the Bank's net interest margin and balance sheet liquidity characteristics, both of which are discussed in greater detail in other sections in this report. The Bank's liquidity is impacted by the volatility of deposits or other funding instruments or, in other words, by the propensity of that money to leave the institution for interest rate-related or other reasons. Deposits can be adversely affected if economic conditions in the Bank's market area weaken. Potentially, the most volatile deposits in a financial institution are jumbo certificates of deposit, meaning time deposits with balances that equal or exceed $250,000, as customers with balances of that magnitude are typically more rate-sensitive than customers with smaller balances.\nThe following table summarizes the distribution of deposits for the periods indicated:\n\nThe Bank gathers deposits from among the communities it serves. The Bank's business is not generally seasonal in nature, and the Bank is not primarily dependent upon funds from sources outside the United States of America, but approximately 27.1% of its deposit base at December 31, 2017, is acquired in the Micronesian islands that are politically organized in free association with the United States and use the U.S. dollar as their currency. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, 35.1% and 34.1% of deposits were from domestic and foreign government sources.\nNon-interest and low interest-bearing demand deposits decreased by $19.2 million, or 2.4%, to $797.1 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $816.4 million at December 31, 2016. Other interest bearing deposits, which are comprised of time deposit open accounts, increased by $30.6 million, or 13.1%, to $264.8 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $234.3 million at December 31, 2016.\nAs mentioned earlier, the Bank has expanded its operations and its branch network since it first opened in 1972, first in Guam, then in the other islands of our region and in San Francisco, California. As time has passed, the Bank has gathered market share in each of the islands. In recent years, in order to diversify its geographic market, the Bank has increased its focus on growth in the San Francisco area. The following table provides figures for deposits in the Bank's administrative regions for the years ending December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017:\n\n * The Freely Associated States are comprised of the Federated States of Micronesia (Chuuk, Kosrae, Pohnpei and Yap), the Republic of Palau and the Republic of the Marshall Islands. \nDuring 2017, deposits increased by a total of $37.5 million, of which $59.4 million was in the Bank's Freely Associated States branches and $23.3 million was in our Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands branches, but decreased in our Guam branches by $39.3million and in California by $5.9 million. Overall, the Bank's deposit base increased by 2.1% during 2017, after rising by 25.0% during 2016. Deposits decreased in the California region by 11.5% in the year ended December 31, 2017, after increasing by 4.7% the previous year as a reversal of gradual, moderate growth in that market.\nDeposit Maturity Distribution\nAt December 31, 2017, the scheduled maturities of time deposits were as follows:\n\nThe Bank provides and services government and business deposit accounts that are frequently more than $250,000 in average balance per account. The account activity for some account types and client types necessitates appropriate liquidity management practices by the Bank to ensure its ability to fund withdrawals.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn the normal course of business, the Bank makes commitments to extend credit to its customers as long as there are no violations of any conditions established in the associated contractual arrangements. These commitments are obligations that represent a potential credit risk to the Bank, yet are not reflected in any form within the Company's consolidated balance sheets other than in a modest contingency reserve against those commitments. Total unused commitments to extend credit were $159.8 million at December 31, 2017, as compared to $152.6 million at December 31, 2016. Unused commitments represented 13.0% of outstanding gross loans at both December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nThe effect on the Bank's revenues, expenses, cash flows and liquidity from the unused portion of the commitments to provide credit cannot be reasonably predicted, because there is no certainty that these lines of credit will ever be fully utilized, if at all. For more information regarding the Company's off-balance sheet arrangements, see Note 16 to the financial statements located elsewhere herein.\nThe following table presents the Bank's commitments to extend credit for the periods indicated:\n\nContractual Obligations\nThe Bank utilizes facilities, equipment and land under various operating leases with original terms ranging from 1 to 99 years. Some of these leases include scheduled rent increases. The total amount of the rent is being expensed on the straight-line method over the lease terms. The Bank has recorded a deferred obligation of $988 thousand and $926 thousand as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which has been included within other liabilities, to reflect the excess of rent expense over cash paid on the leases.\nAt December 31, 2017, annual lease commitments under the above noncancelable operating leases were as follows:\n\nThe Bank leases certain facilities from two separate entities in which two of its directors have separate ownership interests. Lease payments made to these entities during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 approximated $329 thousand, $379 thousand and $370 thousand, respectively.\nAdditionally, the Bank leases office space to third parties, with original lease terms ranging from 3 to 5 years and option periods ranging up to 15 years. At December 31, 2017, minimum future rents to be received under non-cancelable operating sublease agreements were $46 thousand, $13 thousand, $0 thousand and $0 thousand for the years ending December 31, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Although it is possible that one or more of these leases will be renewed, there is no certainty upon which to base an estimate.\nA summary of rental activities for years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, is as follows:\n\nLiquidity and Asset/Liability Management\nLiquidity refers to the Bank's ability to maintain cash flows sufficient to fund operations and to meet obligations and other commitments in a timely and cost-effective fashion. At various times the Bank requires funds to meet short-term cash requirements brought about by loan growth or deposit outflows, the purchase of assets, or liability repayments. The Bank's large base of core deposits is an integral part of its ability to manage its liquidity position appropriately. These core deposits are generated by offering traditional banking services in its service areas and have, historically, been a stable source of funds. To manage liquidity needs properly, cash inflows must be timed to coincide with anticipated outflows, or other sufficient liquid resources must be available to meet varying demands. The Bank manages cash and investment securities in order to be able to meet unexpected, sudden changes in levels of its assets or deposit liabilities without maintaining excessive amounts of balance sheet liquidity. Excess balance sheet liquidity can negatively impact the Bank's interest margin. In order to meet short-term liquidity needs, the Bank may utilize overnight Federal Funds purchases and other borrowing arrangements with correspondent banks, and use interest rate pricing to attract new deposits from local sources; it also maintains collateralized lines of credit with the FHLB and the FRB. In addition, the Bank can obtain cash for temporary needs by selling securities that it classifies as Available-for-Sale.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Bank had an increase in gross loans of $53.9 million from December 31, 2016, funded in part by the $37.5 million increase in its deposit base and in part by a reduction of $48.1 million in its total cash and cash equivalents. One of the measures of liquidity is our loan-to-deposit ratio, based upon gross loans, which increased to 67.7% at December 31, 2017, compared to 66.1% at December 31, 2016. Each calendar quarter, the Bank performs a six-month cash flow analysis to ensure that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet all of its potential cash obligations under a worst-case scenario, and maintains more than adequate liquidity under those hypothetical conditions.\nFHLB, FRB and Other Borrowings and Available Lines of Credit\nThe Bank has off-balance sheet liquidity in the form of Federal Funds purchase arrangements with correspondent banks, as well as collateralized borrowing arrangements with the FHLB and the FRB. The Bank can borrow from the FHLB on a short-term (typically overnight) or long-term (more than one year) basis. At December 31, 2017, the Bank had no long-term borrowings. The Bank had an available line of credit of $121.4 million with the FHLB of Des Moines at December 31, 2017.\nThe Bank can also borrow from the FRB's discount window. It had $21.5 million of investment securities pledged to the FRB San Francisco as collateral on an available line of credit of $20.9 million at December 31, 2017, none of which credit was outstanding.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Bank had arrangements for Federal Funds purchases of up to $17.0 million from three of its U.S. correspondent financial institutions. The Bank had no Federal Funds purchases outstanding at December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company had no other borrowed funds.\nCapital Resources\nThe Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the United States federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Bank's consolidated financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of its assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items, as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.\nQuantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the following table) of total, Tier 1 and common equity Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined) and of Tier 1 capital (as defined) to average assets (as defined). The common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio was newly required effective January 1, 2015. Management believes, as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, that the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the most recent notification from the FDIC categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well capitalized, an institution must maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the following table. There are no conditions or events since the notification that management believes have changed the Bank's category. The Bank's actual capital amounts and ratios as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, are also presented in the table.\n\nMarket Risk\nMarket risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, fair values or cash flows that may result from changes in the price of a financial instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments. Market risk is an attribute of\nall market risk sensitive financial instruments, including securities, loans, deposits and borrowings, as well as a company's role as a financial intermediary in customer-related transactions. The objective of market risk management is to avoid excessive exposure of the company's earnings and equity to loss, and to reduce the volatility inherent in certain types of financial instruments.\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nMarket risk arises from changes in interest rates, exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. The Bank's market risk exposure is primarily that of interest rate risk, and it has established policies and procedures to monitor and limit earnings and balance sheet exposure to changes in interest rates. The Bank does not engage in the trading of financial instruments, and has only nominal direct exposure to currency exchange rate risk, but has indirect exposure to exchange rate risk because of the dominant position of foreign tourism in its primary markets.\nThe principal objective of interest rate risk management (often referred to as asset/liability management\u201d) is to manage the financial components of the Bank's balance sheet, as well as their characteristics, in a manner that will optimize the risk/reward equation for earnings and capital in relation to changing interest rates. The Bank's exposure to market risk is reviewed on a monthly basis by its Asset and Liability Committee. Interest rate risk is the potential for economic losses due to future interest rate changes. These economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and/or a loss of current fair market values. The objective is to measure the effect on net interest income and to adjust the balance sheet to minimize the inherent risk while simultaneously maximizing income. Management realizes certain risks are inherent, and that the goal is to identify and manage those risks. Management uses two methodologies to manage interest rate risk: (i) a standard GAP analysis; and (ii) an interest rate shock simulation model.\nThe planning of asset and liability maturities is an integral part of the management of an institution's net interest margin. To the extent that the maturities of assets and liabilities do not match in a changing interest rate environment, the net interest margin may change over time. Even with perfectly matched re-pricing of assets and liabilities, risks remain in the form of prepayment risk for some loans and securities, or in the form of risks of delays in the adjustment of interest rates applying to either earning assets with floating rates or to interest bearing liabilities. The Bank has generally been able to control its exposure to changing interest rates by maintaining a substantial proportion of its portfolio in floating interest rate loans and a majority of its time deposits with relatively short maturities.\nInterest rate changes do not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or at the same time. Varying interest rate environments can create unexpected changes in prepayment levels of assets and liabilities, which may have a significant effect on the net interest margin and are not reflected in the interest sensitivity analysis table. Because of these factors, an interest sensitivity gap report may not provide a complete assessment of the exposure to changes in interest rates.\nThe Bank uses modeling software for asset/liability management in order to simulate the effects of potential interest rate changes on its net interest margin, and to calculate the estimated fair values of the Bank's financial instruments under different interest rate scenarios. The program utilizes current balances, interest rates, maturity dates and re-pricing information for individual financial instruments, and incorporates assumptions on the characteristics of embedded options along with pricing and duration for those instruments to project the effects of a given interest rate change on the Bank's interest income and interest expense. Rate scenarios consisting of key rate and yield curve projections are run against the Bank's investment, loan, deposit and borrowed funds portfolios. These rate projections can be shocked (an immediate and parallel change in all base rates, up or down) and ramped (with incremental increases or decreases in rates over a specified time period), based on current trends and forecasts, including stable economic conditions.\nThe following table sets forth the estimated changes in the Bank's net interest income that would result from the designated instantaneous parallel shifts in interest rates noted, as of December 31, 2017. Computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions, including relative levels of market interest rates, loan prepayments and deposit decay, and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. (Please note that, in the current interest rate environment, the larger reductions in rates presented in the analysis are unlikely to occur.)\n\nThese data do not reflect any actions that we may undertake in response to changes in interest rates, such as changes in rates paid on certain deposit accounts based on local competitive factors, which could improve or attenuate the actual impact on net interest income.\nAs with any method of gauging interest rate risk, there are certain shortcomings inherent to the methodology noted above. The model assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous, and result in parallel shifts in the yield curve. In reality, rate changes are rarely instantaneous. The use of the simplifying assumption that short-term and long-term rates change by the same degree also disregards historic rate change patterns, which rarely show parallel yield curve shifts. Further, the model assumes that certain assets and liabilities of similar maturity or period to re-pricing will react in the same way to changes in rates. In reality, certain types of financial instruments may react in advance of changes in market rates, while the reaction of other types of financial instruments may lag significantly behind the change in general market rates. Additionally, the methodology noted above does not reflect the full impact of annual and lifetime restrictions on changes in rates for certain assets, such as adjustable rate loans. When interest rates change, actual loan prepayments and actual early withdrawals from time certificates may deviate significantly from the assumptions used in the model. Finally, this methodology does not measure or reflect the impact that higher rates may have on adjustable-rate loan clients' ability to service their debt. All of these factors are considered in less formulaic ways in monitoring the Bank's exposure to interest rate risk.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nGeneral\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP\u201d). The financial information contained within our consolidated financial statements is, to a significant extent, based on approximate measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred. A variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained, either when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset or relieving a liability. In certain instances, we use a discount factor and prepayment assumptions to determine the present value of assets and liabilities. A change in the discount factor or prepayment speeds could increase or decrease the values of those assets and liabilities, which would result in either a beneficial or adverse impact to our financial results. We use historical loss factors as one factor in determining the inherent loss that may be present in our loan portfolio. Actual losses could differ significantly from the historical factors that we use. Other estimates that we use are related to the realization of our deferred tax assets and the expected useful lives of our depreciable assets. In addition, GAAP itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another, although the economics of our transactions would remain the same.\nFair Value of Securities\nIn accordance with GAAP, the Bank revalues the Available-for-Sale component of its investment portfolio on a quarterly basis, and records any unrealized gain or loss as an adjustment to other comprehensive income in its equity accounts. Held-to-Maturity securities are recorded at their amortized book value. The Bank also evaluates whether any of its security holdings are Other Than Temporarily Impaired ( OTTI\u201d), but has determined that, as of December 31, 2017, none of its securities are deemed to be OTTI.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the potential losses in our loan portfolio. Our accounting for estimated loan losses was previously discussed in this Item 7 under the heading, Allowance for Loan Losses.\u201d\nDeferred Tax Assets\nOur net deferred income tax asset arises from temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities reported in the financial statements and the amounts used for income tax return purposes. Our accounting for Deferred Tax Assets was previously discussed under the heading Income Tax Expense\u201d.\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_tables": "Table 59: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td>

overview of a financial institution's report, which includes management's discussion and analysis (MD&A) of the financial condition, changes in operations, liquidity, and capital resources. Key points of the executive summary include:\n\n1. Management evaluates the bank's financial condition and performance using specific metrics, comparing them to peer group financial institutions and internally set objectives. The bank primarily engages in commercial banking activities and operates in U.S. territories, western Pacific U.S.-affiliated nations, and California, focusing heavily on Guam.\n\n2. Four significant factors impacted the company's financial condition and operations in 2017:\n   - Increase in tourism in Guam and surrounding islands boosted regional economy and the bank's business.\n   - Significant military funding for U.S. Marine relocation to Guam resulted in substantial construction activities, benefiting the local economy.\n   - The strong economy in the San Francisco Bay area helped expand the bank's business there.\n   - The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act required a reassessment of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets due to a corporate tax rate reduction.\n\n3. Net income attributable to common stockholders was $8.0 million for 2017, down from $13.5 million in 2016.\n\n4. Major factors that impacted operations included:\n  - A rise in net interest income to $79.5 million for 2017.\n  - The net interest margin decreased to 4.24%.\n  - Increased provision for loan losses to $7.5 million to cover loan portfolio growth and potential losses.\n  - Non-interest income grew by $2.7 million, mainly due to increased trust fees and service charges.\n  - Non-interest expense rose to $70.4 million mainly due to higher salaries, equipment costs, and administrative expenses.\n\n5. The bank's liquidity position increased, supported by loan portfolio growth and increased liabilities and equity, among other factors.\n\n6. The bank has ample liquidity, with $126.1 million in cash and equivalents and a substantial available borrowing capacity.\n\n7. Lending activities are focused primarily within the bank's market area and through its branch in San Francisco. The loan portfolio is diversified, with commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans being the most significant.\n\n8. The bank takes measures to improve its net interest margin, such as optimizing loan rates and reducing deposit costs.\n\n9. Management of credit risk involves proactive identification and management of problem loans and maintaining an adequate allowance for loan losses.\n\n10. The bank's portfolio of deposits provides cushioning against interest rate changes and supports liquidity management, although it doesn't accept brokered deposits.\n\nThis summary has been truncated due to its extensive nature. It provides an overall view of the bank's financial highlights, key factors influencing its operations, asset and lending growth, and various financial tactics geared towards managing risks and improving financial outcomes."}
