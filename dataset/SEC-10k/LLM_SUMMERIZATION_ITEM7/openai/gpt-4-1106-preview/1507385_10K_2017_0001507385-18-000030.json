Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We make statements in this section that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. For a complete discussion of forward-looking statements, see the section in this report entitled Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d Certain risks may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the following discussion. For a discussion of such risk factors, see the section in this report entitled Risk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nVEREIT is a full-service real estate operating company which owns and manages one of the largest portfolios of single-tenant commercial properties in the U.S. The Company has 4,091 retail, restaurant, office and industrial operating properties with an aggregate 94.4 million square feet, of which 98.8% was leased as of December 31, 2017, with a weighted-average remaining lease term of 9.5 years.\nPrior to the fourth quarter of 2017, we operated through two business segments, our real estate investment segment and our investment management segment, Cole Capital, which sponsored and managed non-listed real estate investment trusts. On November 13, 2017, we entered into the Cole Capital Purchase and Sale Agreement to sell substantially all of the Cole Capital segment. The sale closed on February 1, 2018. Substantially all of the Cole Capital segment is presented as discontinued operations and the Company's remaining financial results are reported as a single segment for all periods presented. See Note 5 -Discontinued Operations, for further information on the sale of Cole Capital.\nEffective January 1, 2017, we determined that adjusted funds from operations ( AFFO\u201d), a non-GAAP measure, and our real estate portfolio and economic metrics, should exclude the impact of properties owned by the Company for the month beginning with the date that (i) the properties' related mortgage loan is in default and (ii) management decides to transfer the properties to the lender in connection with settling the mortgage note obligation, and ending with the disposition date (\"Excluded Properties\"), to better reflect our ongoing operations. Excluded Properties during the year ended December 31, 2017, were two vacant office properties and five industrial properties, two of which were vacant. Excluded Properties at December 31, 2017, included one vacant industrial property, comprised of 307,275 square feet, which secured a mortgage note payable, with debt outstanding of $16.2 million. The Company did not update data presented for prior periods for this change as it determined the impact on our prior periods was immaterial.\nOur Business Environment and Current Outlook\nCurrent conditions in the global capital markets remain volatile as the world's economic growth has been affected by geopolitical and economic events. In the United States, the overall economic environment continued to improve in 2017. During 2017, the U.S. real gross domestic product increased 2.3%, the unemployment rate decreased 0.6 percentage points to 4.1%, and Core CPI, a measure of inflation which removes food & energy prices and is seasonally adjusted, increased 1.8%, as compared to the same period a year earlier.\nEconomic trends and government policies affect global and regional commercial real estate markets as well as our operations directly. These include: overall economic activity and employment growth, interest rate levels, the cost and availability of credit and the impact of tax and regulatory policies.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Accounting Estimates\nOur accounting policies have been established to conform with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Management believes that we have made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate manner and in a way that accurately reflects our financial condition. We continually test and evaluate these estimates and assumptions using our historical knowledge of the business, as well as other factors, to ensure that they are reasonable for reporting purposes. However, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to the various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, thus resulting in a different presentation of the financial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different assumptions or estimates that may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. We believe the following critical accounting policies govern the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements, which should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies and procedures included in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements.\nGoodwill Impairment\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We adopted ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Others (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment ( ASU 2017-04\u201d), which simplifies the measurement of goodwill impairment by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test (comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill). The risks and uncertainties involved in applying the principles related to goodwill impairment include, but are not limited to, the following:\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We estimate the fair value using discounted cash flows and relevant competitor multiples.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We monitor factors that may impact the fair value including market comparable company multiples, interest rates and global economic conditions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We use a combined income and market approach in evaluations for potential impairment, which requires management to make key assumptions related to revenue growth rate, cash flow assumptions, discount rate and selection of comparable companies.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> See Note 9 - Fair Value Measures\u201d for discussion regarding our sensitivity analysis performed around these assumptions.\nReal Estate Investment Impairment\nWe invest in real estate assets and subsequently monitor those investments quarterly for impairment, including the review of real estate properties subject to direct financing leases. Additionally, we record depreciation and amortization related to our investments. The risks and uncertainties involved in applying the principles related to real estate investments include, but are not limited to, the following:\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The estimated useful lives of our depreciable assets affect the amount of depreciation and amortization recognized on our investments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The review of impairment indicators and subsequent determination of the undiscounted future cash flows could require us to reduce the value of assets and recognize an impairment loss.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The fair value of held for sale assets is estimated by management.

As a first step in the notes receivable impairment process, we must determine, based on current information and events, if it is probable that we will be unable to collect the amounts due in accordance with the loan agreement. The risks and uncertainties involved in applying the principles related to notes receivable include, but are not limited to, the following:\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Evaluating the financial condition and other current obligations of the borrower involves judgment in assessing their liquidity and financial stability.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Allocation of Purchase Price of Real Estate Assets\nIn connection with our acquisition of properties, we allocate the purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets and\nliabilities acquired based on their respective estimated fair values. Tangible assets consist of land, buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements. Intangible assets consist of above- and below- market lease values and the value of in-place leases. Our purchase price allocations are developed utilizing third-party appraisal reports, industry standards and management experience. The risks and uncertainties involved in applying the principles related to purchase price allocations include, but are not limited to, the following:\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The value allocated to land as opposed to buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements affects the amount of depreciation expense we record.

However, the General Partner, including its TRS entities, and the Operating Partnership are still subject to certain state and local income and franchise taxes in the various jurisdictions in which they operate.\nWe provide for income taxes in accordance with current authoritative accounting and tax guidance. The tax provision or benefit related to significant or unusual items is recognized in the quarter in which those items occur. In addition, the effect of changes in enacted tax laws, rates or tax status is recognized in the quarter in which the change occurs. The risks and uncertainties involved in applying the principles related to income taxes include, but are not limited to, the following:\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our calculations related to income taxes contain uncertainties due to judgment used to calculate tax liabilities in the application of complex tax laws and regulations across the tax jurisdictions where we operate;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, the Canadian federal jurisdiction and various state and local jurisdictions, and are subject to routine examinations by the respective tax authorities.

During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded a loss of $0.8 million in relation to the write-off of deferred financing costs and net premiums consisting of losses relating to the early extinguishment of our 2017 Senior Notes of $13.2 million and the prepayment of a portion of the Credit Facility Term Loan of $4.3 million, as well as the 2016 Term Loan of $2.6 million, as discussed in Note 10 - Debt\u201d to our consolidated financial statements. These losses were partially offset by a gain on forgiveness of debt of $19.1 million related to a mortgage loan settled by foreclosure. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded a gain on forgiveness of debt of $4.8 million related to the foreclosure of one property.\nOther Income, Net\n2017 vs 2016 - The increase of $1.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 was primarily due to post-closing adjustments, of $1.6 million, recorded in accordance with the purchase and sale agreement during the year ended December 31, 2016 related to a multi-tenant asset portfolio sale completed in 2014, offset by a decrease in interest income related to the Company's investment securities and mortgage notes receivable of $0.6 million.\n2016 vs 2015 - The decrease of $4.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily a result of a decrease in disposition fees earned from 1031 real estate programs of $3.8 million.\nReserve for Loan Loss\nThe reserve for loan loss of $15.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 related to an unsecured note from RCS Capital Corporation in connection with the unconsummated sale of Cole Capital. During the three months ended December 31, 2015, the Company assessed the collectability of the note, determined it was unlikely to be repaid and recorded the reserve equal to the carrying value of the note.\nEquity in Income and Gain on Disposition of Unconsolidated Entities\n2017 vs 2016 - The decrease of $7.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 was primarily the result of a gain of $10.2 million recognized on the disposition of one unconsolidated joint venture owning one property in 2016, with no comparable gain in 2017.\n2016 vs 2015 - Equity in income (loss) and gain on disposition of unconsolidated entities increased $0.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded a gain of $10.2 million related to the disposition of one property, comprising 343 million square feet of office space, owned by an unconsolidated joint venture. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded a gain of $6.7 million related to the disposition of its interest in one consolidated joint venture, whose only assets consisted of investments in three unconsolidated joint ventures that owned three properties, comprising 752 million square feet of retail space. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized $0.9 million and $2.3 million of net income, respectively, from the unconsolidated joint ventures. The Company recorded equity in loss related to its investments in the Cole REITs of $1.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to equity in income of $0.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nGain (Loss) on Derivative Instruments, Net\n2017 vs 2016 - The $4.2 million increase during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016, was primarily a result of the termination of six interest rate swaps in connection with the early repayment of the outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility Term Loan, as discussed in Note 11 - Derivatives and Hedging Activities to our consolidated financial statements, which resulted in a gain of $1.1 million as compared to a loss of $3.3 million in 2016.\n2016 vs 2015 - The decrease during the year ended December 31, 2016, is due to the termination of two interest rate swaps in connection with the early repayment of a portion of the Credit Facility Term Loan, which resulted in a loss of $3.3 million, offset by an increase in the fair value of the Company's interest rate swaps.\nGain (Loss) on Disposition of Real Estate and Real Estate Assets Held For Sale, Net\n2017 vs 2016 - The increase in gain on disposition of real estate and held for sale assets, net of $16.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016, was due to the Company's disposition of 131 properties, excluding six properties transferred to the lender in either a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure or foreclosure sale transaction, for an aggregate sales price of $594.9 million which resulted in a gain of $64.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the disposal of 301 properties for an aggregate sales price of $1.1 billion during the same period in 2016 for a gain of $50.6 million, which included $28.8 million of goodwill allocation related to the sales. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company also recognized a loss of $3.1 million related to assets classified as held for sale, as compared to a loss of $5.1 million during the same period in 2016.\n2016 vs 2015 - During the year ended December 31, 2016, the change of $117.8 million from a net loss on dispositions of real estate to a net gain was due to the Company's disposition of 301 properties for an aggregate sales price of $1.1 billion, which resulted in an aggregate gain of $50.6 million, as compared to the disposal of 228 properties for an aggregate sales price of $1.4 billion during the same period in 2015 for a loss of $69.1 million. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company also recorded a loss of $5.1 million related to assets classified as held for sale, as compared to a loss of $3.2 million during the same period in 2015.\nProvision for Income Taxes\n2017 vs 2016 - The consolidated provision for income taxes of $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to a provision of $7.1 million for the same period in 2016 reflects an overall decrease in expense attributable to higher state taxes in 2016 and tax on net income from properties held in and sold by a TRS in 2016, which were partially offset by tax on the gain on the sale of certain Canadian properties in 2017.\n2016 vs 2015 - The increase of $2.5 million is primarily due to the 2014 accrued state tax expense exceeding actual expenses incurred, resulting in a decrease to the provision for income taxes during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nLoss from Discontinued Operations\n2017 vs 2016 - During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell substantially all of the Cole Capital segment. The decrease in loss from discontinued operations of $104.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to decreases in impairment of goodwill of $120.9 million, in general and administrative expenses of $18.8 million and in amortization of intangible assets of $11.7 million, partially offset by the loss recognized on classification as held for sale of $20.0 million and an increase in the provision for income taxes of $24.7 million. Revenues, net of reallowed fees and commissions increased $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\n2016 vs 2015 - The decrease in loss from discontinued operations of $60.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to a decrease in impairment of intangible assets and goodwill of $92.4 million, offset by a decrease in the benefit from income taxes.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nOur results are presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We also disclose certain non-GAAP measures, as discussed further below. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in our internal analysis of results and believes these measures are useful to investors for the reasons explained below. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as substitutes for any measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nFunds from Operations and Adjusted Funds from Operations\nDue to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, as discussed below, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc. ( NAREIT\u201d), an industry trade group, has promulgated a supplemental performance measure known as funds from operations ( FFO\u201d), which we believe to be an appropriate supplemental performance measure to reflect the operating performance of a REIT. FFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under U.S. GAAP.\nNAREIT defines FFO as net income or loss computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding gains or losses from disposition of property, depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and impairment write-downs on depreciable real estate including the pro rata share of adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. We calculated FFO in accordance with NAREIT's definition described above.\nIn addition to FFO, we use adjusted funds from operations ( AFFO\u201d) as a non-GAAP supplemental financial performance measure to evaluate the operating performance of the Company. AFFO, as defined by the Company, excludes from FFO non-routine items such as acquisition-related expenses, litigation, merger and other non-routine costs, net of insurance recoveries, held for sale loss on discontinued operations, gains or losses on sale of investment securities or mortgage notes receivable and legal settlements and insurance recoveries not in the ordinary course of business. We also exclude certain non-cash items such as impairments of goodwill and intangible assets, straight-line rent, net of bad debt expense related to straight-line rent, net direct financing lease adjustments, gains or losses on derivatives, reserves for loan loss, gains or losses on the extinguishment or forgiveness of debt, non-current portion of the tax benefit or expense, equity-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets, deferred financing costs, premiums and discounts on debt and investments, above-market lease assets and below-market lease liabilities. Effective January 1, 2017, we determined to omit the impact of the Excluded Properties and related non-recourse mortgage notes from FFO to calculate AFFO. We did not adjust AFFO during the years prior to January 1, 2017 as the impact was immaterial. Management believes that excluding these costs from FFO provides investors with supplemental performance information that is consistent with the performance models and analysis used by management, and provides investors a view of the performance of our portfolio over time. AFFO allows for a comparison of the performance of our operations with other publicly-traded REITs, as AFFO, or an equivalent measure, is routinely reported by publicly-traded REITs, and we believe often used by analysts and investors for comparison purposes.\nFor all of these reasons, we believe FFO and AFFO, in addition to net income (loss), as defined by U.S. GAAP, are helpful supplemental performance measures and useful in understanding the various ways in which our management evaluates the performance of the Company over time. However, not all REITs calculate FFO and AFFO the same way, so comparisons with other REITs may not be meaningful. FFO and AFFO should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) and are not intended to be used as a liquidity measure indicative of cash flow available to fund our cash needs. Neither the SEC, NAREIT, nor any other regulatory body has evaluated the acceptability of the exclusions used to adjust FFO in order to calculate AFFO and its use as a non-GAAP financial performance measure.\nThe table below presents FFO and AFFO for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands, except share and per share data) and includes both continuing operations, which primarily represent the Company's real estate operations, and discontinued operations, which represent substantially all of Cole Capital.\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>

As discussed in Note 10 - Debt, the Company subsequently used a portion of the proceeds from the 2017 Bond Offering to repay borrowings, including swap termination costs and accrued unpaid interest under its $500.0 million Credit Facility Term Loan on August 11, 2017. The Company used the remaining proceeds to pay down secured debt.\nContinuous Equity Offering Program\nOn September 19, 2016, the Company registered a continuous equity offering program (the Program\u201d) pursuant to which the Company can offer and sell, from time to time through September 19, 2019 in at-the-market\u201d offerings or certain other transactions, shares of common stock with an aggregate gross sales price of up to $750.0 million, through its sales agents. The Company intends to use the proceeds from any sale of shares for general corporate purposes, which may include funding potential acquisitions and repurchasing or repaying outstanding indebtedness. As of December 31, 2017, no shares of common stock have been issued pursuant to the Program.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn May 12, 2017, the Company's board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $200.0 million of the Company's outstanding Common Stock over the subsequent 12 months, as market conditions warrant. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the Company repurchased 68,759 shares of common stock in multiple open transactions for $0.5 million.\nDisposition Activity\nAs part of our effort to optimize our real estate portfolio by focusing on holding core assets, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we disposed of 137 properties and six properties transferred to the lender in either a deed-in-lieu foreclosure or foreclosure sale transaction for an aggregate sales price of $594.9 million, of which our share was $574.4 million, resulting in consolidated proceeds of $445.5 million after mortgage loan assumption and closing costs. We expect to continue to explore opportunities to sell additional properties to provide us further financial flexibility and fund property acquisitions.\nCredit Facility\nSummary and Obligations\nWe, as guarantor, and the Operating Partnership, as borrower, are parties to the Credit Facility with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, and the other lenders party thereto.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Credit Facility had an outstanding balance of $185.0 million and allowed for maximum borrowings of $2.3 billion under its revolving credit facility, subject to borrowing availability. The maximum aggregate dollar amount of letters of credit that may be outstanding at any one time under the Credit Facility is $25.0 million. The Operating Partnership used a portion of the proceeds from the 2017 Bond Offering to repay all of the outstanding borrowings, including swap termination costs and accrued and unpaid interest, under its $500.0 million Credit Facility Term Loan on August 11, 2017.\nThe revolving credit facility generally bears interest at an annual rate of London Inter-Bank Offer Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) plus 1.00% to 1.80% or Base Rate plus 0.00% to 0.80% (based upon our then current credit rating). Base Rate\u201d is defined as the highest of the prime rate, the federal funds rate plus 0.50% or a floating rate based on one month LIBOR, determined on a daily basis. In addition, the Credit Agreement provides the flexibility for interest rate auctions, pursuant to which, at the Company's election, the Company may request that lenders make competitive bids to provide revolving loans, which competitive bids may be at pricing levels that differ from the foregoing interest rates.\nThe Credit Agreement provides for monthly interest payments under the Credit Facility. In the event of default, at the election of a majority of the lenders (or automatically upon a bankruptcy event of default with respect to the OP or the General Partner), the commitments of the lenders under the Credit Facility will mature, and payment of any unpaid amounts in respect of the Credit Facility will be accelerated. The Credit Facility terminates on June 30, 2018, unless extended in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement provides for a one-year extension option, exercisable at the Company's election and subject to certain customary conditions, as well as certain customary amend and extend\u201d provisions. At any time, upon timely notice by the OP and subject to any breakage fees, the OP may prepay borrowings under the Credit Facility (subject to certain limitations applicable to the prepayment of any loans obtained through an interest rate auction, as described above). The OP incurs a fee equal to 0.15% to 0.25% per annum (based upon the General Partner's then current credit rating) multiplied by the commitments (whether or not utilized) in respect of the revolving credit facility. In addition, the OP incurs customary administrative agent, letter of credit issuance, letter of credit fronting, extension and other fees.\nCredit Facility Covenants\nThe Credit Facility requires restrictions on corporate guarantees, as well as the maintenance of certain financial covenants. The key financial covenants in the Credit Facility, as defined and calculated per the terms of the Credit Agreement include maintaining the following:\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unsecured Credit Facility Key Covenants\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Required\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimum tangible net worth\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u2265 $5.5 B\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ratio of total indebtedness to total asset value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u2264 60%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ratio of adjusted EBITDA to fixed charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u2265 1.5x\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ratio of secured indebtedness to total asset value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u2264 45%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ratio of unsecured indebtedness to unencumbered asset value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u2264 60%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ratio of unencumbered adjusted NOI to unsecured interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u2265 1.75x\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimum unencumbered asset value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u2265 $8.0 B\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the purposes of determining unencumbered asset value, the Company is permitted to include restaurant properties representing up to 30% of its unencumbered asset value in such calculation.\nThe Company believes that it was in compliance with the financial covenants pursuant to the Credit Agreement and is not restricted from accessing any borrowing availability under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2017.\nCorporate Bonds\nSummary and Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2017, the OP had $2.85 billion aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes outstanding. The indenture governing the Senior Notes requires that the Company be in compliance with certain key financial covenants, including maintaining the following:\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate Bond Key Covenants\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Required\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Limitation on incurrence of total debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u2264 65%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Limitation on incurrence of secured debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u2264 40%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt service coverage ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u2265 1.5x\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance of total unencumbered assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u2265 150%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThere were no changes to the financial covenants of our existing Senior Notes during the year ended December 31, 2017. The covenants of our new Senior Notes issued in 2017 are materially the same as our then existing Senior Notes. As of December 31, 2017, the Company believes that it was in compliance with these financial covenants based on the covenant limits and calculations in place at that time.\nConvertible Debt\nSummary and Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes (as defined in Note 10 - Debt). The OP has issued corresponding identical convertible notes to the General Partner. There were no changes to the terms of the Convertible Notes and the Company believes it was in compliance with the financial covenants pursuant to the indenture governing the Convertible Notes as of December 31, 2017.\nMortgage Notes Payable and Other Debt\nSummary and Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had non-recourse mortgage indebtedness of $2.1 billion, which was collateralized by 472 properties, reflecting a decrease from December 31, 2016 of $558.9 million derived primarily from our disposition activity during the year ended December 31, 2017. Our mortgage indebtedness bore interest at the weighted-average rate of 4.92% per annum and had a weighted-average maturity of 4.1 years. We may in the future incur additional mortgage debt on the properties we currently own or use long-term non-recourse financing to acquire additional properties.\nThe payment terms of our loan obligations vary. In general, only interest amounts are payable monthly with all unpaid principal and interest due at maturity. Some of our loan agreements require that we comply with specific reporting and financial covenants mainly related to debt coverage ratios and loan-to-value ratios. Each loan that has these requirements has specific ratio thresholds that must be met.\nRestrictions on Loan Covenants\nOur mortgage loan obligations generally restrict corporate guarantees and require the maintenance of financial covenants, including maintenance of certain financial ratios (such as specified debt to equity and debt service coverage ratios), as well as the maintenance of a minimum net worth. The mortgage loan agreements contain no dividend restrictions except in the event of default or when a distribution would drive liquidity below the applicable thresholds. At December 31, 2017, the Company believes that it was in compliance with the financial covenants under the mortgage loan agreements, except for the $16.2 million loan in default as described above and in Note 10 - Debt\u201d to our consolidated financial statements.\nOther Debt\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company repaid the remaining outstanding principal balance on the secured term loan from KBC Bank, N.V. (the KBC Loan\u201d).\nDividends\nOn November 7, 2017, the Company's board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.1375 per share of common stock (equaling an annualized dividend rate of $0.55 per share) for the fourth quarter of 2017 to stockholders of record as of December 29, 2017, which was paid on January 16, 2018. An equivalent distribution by the Operating Partnership is applicable per OP unit.\nOur Series F Preferred Stock, as discussed in Note 15 - Equity\u201d to our consolidated financial statements, will pay cumulative cash dividends at the rate of 6.70% per annum on their liquidation preference of $25.00 per share (equivalent to $1.675 per share on an annual basis). As of December 31, 2017, there were approximately 42.8 million shares of Series F Preferred Stock (and approximately 42.8 million corresponding Series F Preferred Units that were issued to the General Partner) and 86,874 Limited Partner Series F Preferred Units that were issued and outstanding.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 (in thousands):\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal payments - mortgage notes (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,071,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>98,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>487,975\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>667,609\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>817,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments - mortgage notes (1) (2) (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>421,575\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100,177\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>176,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>108,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal payments - Credit Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>185,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>185,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments - Credit Facility (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal payments - corporate bonds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,850,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>750,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>400,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,700,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments - corporate bonds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>695,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>114,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>187,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>158,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>234,786\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal payments - convertible debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,000,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>597,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>402,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments - convertible debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating and ground lease commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>308,434\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>215,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,589,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,143,398\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,071,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,371,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,003,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________________________\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>For the loan in maturity default, as discussed in Note 10 - Debt , the payment obligations for future periods are based on an estimated extension of maturity to January 1, 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>As of December 31, 2017, we had $78.9 million of variable rate mortgage notes effectively fixed through the use of interest rate swap agreements.

The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in rental receipts related to the disposition of 438 consolidated properties subsequent to January 1, 2016 and an increase in litigation and other non-routine costs paid during the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was mostly offset by a decrease in interest payments and insurance recoveries received as compared to the same period in 2016, the receipt of an income tax refund during the year ended December 31, 2017, and an increase in rental receipts related to the acquisition of 96 consolidated properties subsequent to January 1, 2016.\nInvesting Activities - Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 changed $1.2 billion to $274.1 million from cash provided by investing activities of $881.6 million during the same period in 2016. The change was primarily related to an increase in investments in real estate assets of $598.8 million, a decrease in cash proceeds from dispositions of real estate and joint ventures of $555.2 million.\nFinancing Activities - Net cash used in financing activities of $756.6 million decreased $750.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 from $1.5 billion during the same period in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in repayments of debt, net of proceeds, of $1.5 billion, which was partially offset by the 2016 common stock offering resulting in net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and offering costs, of $702.8 million and an increase in distributions paid of $28.1 million.\nCash Flow Analysis for the year ended December 31, 2016\nOperating Activities - During the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash provided by operating activities decreased $61.7 million to $797.9 million from $859.7 million during the same period in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in rental receipts related to the disposition of 529 consolidated properties subsequent to January 1, 2015. This decrease was partially offset by a decrease in interest payments and payments related to the Audit Committee Investigation and related litigation, net of insurance recoveries.\nInvesting Activities - Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased $59.8 million to $881.6 million from $941.4 million during the same period in 2015. The decrease was primarily related to an increase in investments in real estate assets of $63.9 million, an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture of $25.8 million during 2016 and a decrease in uses and refunds of deposits for real estate assets of $35.4 million. These decreases were partially offset by a decrease in real estate development payments of $40.3 million and the receipt of $50.0 million on the Affiliate Lines of Credit, as compared to $10.0 million in 2015.\nFinancing Activities - Net cash used in financing activities of $1.5 billion decreased $644.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 from $2.2 billion during the same period in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the 2016 common stock offering resulting in net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and offering costs, of $702.5 million and an increase in proceeds from debt, net of repayments, of $306.3 million, which were partially offset by an increase in distributions paid of $345.0 million\nElection as a REIT\nThe General Partner elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2011. As a REIT, except as discussed below, the General Partner generally is not subject to federal income tax on taxable income that it distributes to its stockholders so long as it distributes at least 90% of its annual taxable income (computed without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains). REITs are subject to a number of other organizational and operational requirements. Even if the General Partner maintains its qualification for taxation as a REIT, it may be subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and property, federal income taxes on certain income and excise taxes on its undistributed income. We believe we are organized and operating in such a manner as to qualify to be taxed as a REIT for the taxable year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe Operating Partnership is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, the Operating Partnership is not a taxable entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Instead, each partner in the Operating Partnership is required to take into account its allocable share of the Operating Partnership's income, gains, losses, deductions and credits for each taxable year. However, the Operating Partnership may be subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and property. Under the LPA, the Operating Partnership is required to conduct business in such a manner as to permit the General partner at all times to qualify as a REIT.\nThe Company conducted substantially all of its Cole Capital business activities through a TRS. A TRS is a subsidiary of a REIT that is subject to corporate federal, state and local income taxes, as applicable. The Company's use of a TRS enables it to engage in certain business activities while complying with the REIT qualification requirements and to retain any income generated by these businesses for reinvestment without the requirement to distribute those earnings. The Company conducts all of its business in the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada and, as a result, it files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, the Canadian federal jurisdiction and various state and local jurisdictions. Certain of the Company's inter-company transactions that have been eliminated in consolidation for financial accounting purposes are also subject to taxation.\nInflation\nWe may be adversely impacted by inflation on any leases that do not contain indexed escalation provisions. However, net leases that require the tenant to pay its allocable share of operating expenses, including common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes and insurance, may reduce our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation.\nRelated Party Transactions and Agreements\nThrough the closing of the Cole Capital sale, we were contractually responsible for managing the Cole REITs' affairs on a day-to-day basis, identifying and making acquisitions and investments on the Cole REITs' behalf, and recommending to each of the Cole REIT's respective board of directors an approach for providing investors with liquidity. In addition, we distributed the shares of common stock for certain of the Cole REITs and advised them regarding offerings, managed relationships with participating broker-dealers and financial advisors, and provided assistance in connection with compliance matters relating to the offerings. We received compensation and reimbursement for services relating to the Cole REITs' offerings and the investment, management and disposition of their respective assets, as applicable. See Note 17 - Related Party Transactions and Arrangements\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in this report for a further explanation of the various related party transactions, agreements and fees.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no material off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We make statements in this section that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. For a complete discussion of forward-looking statements, see the section in this report entitled Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d Certain risks may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the following discussion. For a discussion of such risk factors, see the section in this report entitled Risk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nVEREIT is a full-service real estate operating company which owns and manages one of the largest portfolios of single-tenant commercial properties in the U.S. The Company has 4,091 retail, restaurant, office and industrial operating properties with an aggregate 94.4 million square feet, of which 98.8% was leased as of December 31, 2017, with a weighted-average remaining lease term of 9.5 years.\nPrior to the fourth quarter of 2017, we operated through two business segments, our real estate investment segment and our investment management segment, Cole Capital, which sponsored and managed non-listed real estate investment trusts. On November 13, 2017, we entered into the Cole Capital Purchase and Sale Agreement to sell substantially all of the Cole Capital segment. The sale closed on February 1, 2018. Substantially all of the Cole Capital segment is presented as discontinued operations and the Company's remaining financial results are reported as a single segment for all periods presented. See Note 5 -Discontinued Operations, for further information on the sale of Cole Capital.\nEffective January 1, 2017, we determined that adjusted funds from operations ( AFFO\u201d), a non-GAAP measure, and our real estate portfolio and economic metrics, should exclude the impact of properties owned by the Company for the month beginning with the date that (i) the properties' related mortgage loan is in default and (ii) management decides to transfer the properties to the lender in connection with settling the mortgage note obligation, and ending with the disposition date (\"Excluded Properties\"), to better reflect our ongoing operations. Excluded Properties during the year ended December 31, 2017, were two vacant office properties and five industrial properties, two of which were vacant. Excluded Properties at December 31, 2017, included one vacant industrial property, comprised of 307,275 square feet, which secured a mortgage note payable, with debt outstanding of $16.2 million. The Company did not update data presented for prior periods for this change as it determined the impact on our prior periods was immaterial.\nOur Business Environment and Current Outlook\nCurrent conditions in the global capital markets remain volatile as the world's economic growth has been affected by geopolitical and economic events. In the United States, the overall economic environment continued to improve in 2017. During 2017, the U.S. real gross domestic product increased 2.3%, the unemployment rate decreased 0.6 percentage points to 4.1%, and Core CPI, a measure of inflation which removes food & energy prices and is seasonally adjusted, increased 1.8%, as compared to the same period a year earlier.\nEconomic trends and government policies affect global and regional commercial real estate markets as well as our operations directly. These include: overall economic activity and employment growth, interest rate levels, the cost and availability of credit and the impact of tax and regulatory policies.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Accounting Estimates\nOur accounting policies have been established to conform with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Management believes that we have made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate manner and in a way that accurately reflects our financial condition. We continually test and evaluate these estimates and assumptions using our historical knowledge of the business, as well as other factors, to ensure that they are reasonable for reporting purposes. However, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to the various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, thus resulting in a different presentation of the financial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different assumptions or estimates that may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. We believe the following critical accounting policies govern the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements, which should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies and procedures included in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements.\nGoodwill Impairment\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We adopted ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Others (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment ( ASU 2017-04\u201d), which simplifies the measurement of goodwill impairment by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test (comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill). The risks and uncertainties involved in applying the principles related to goodwill impairment include, but are not limited to, the following:\n \u2022 We estimate the fair value using discounted cash flows and relevant competitor multiples. \n \u2022 We monitor factors that may impact the fair value including market comparable company multiples, interest rates and global economic conditions. \n \u2022 We use a combined income and market approach in evaluations for potential impairment, which requires management to make key assumptions related to revenue growth rate, cash flow assumptions, discount rate and selection of comparable companies.  See Note 9 - Fair Value Measures\u201d for discussion regarding our sensitivity analysis performed around these assumptions.\nReal Estate Investment Impairment\nWe invest in real estate assets and subsequently monitor those investments quarterly for impairment, including the review of real estate properties subject to direct financing leases. Additionally, we record depreciation and amortization related to our investments. The risks and uncertainties involved in applying the principles related to real estate investments include, but are not limited to, the following:\n \u2022 The estimated useful lives of our depreciable assets affect the amount of depreciation and amortization recognized on our investments. \n \u2022 The review of impairment indicators and subsequent determination of the undiscounted future cash flows could require us to reduce the value of assets and recognize an impairment loss. \n \u2022 The fair value of held for sale assets is estimated by management. This estimated value could result in a reduction of the carrying value of the asset. \n \u2022 Changes in assumptions based on actual results may have a material impact on the Company's financial results.  Loans Held for Investment Impairment\nWe evaluate loans held for investment on a quarterly basis. As a first step in the notes receivable impairment process, we must determine, based on current information and events, if it is probable that we will be unable to collect the amounts due in accordance with the loan agreement. The risks and uncertainties involved in applying the principles related to notes receivable include, but are not limited to, the following:\n \u2022 Evaluating the financial condition and other current obligations of the borrower involves judgment in assessing their liquidity and financial stability.  Allocation of Purchase Price of Real Estate Assets\nIn connection with our acquisition of properties, we allocate the purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets and\nliabilities acquired based on their respective estimated fair values. Tangible assets consist of land, buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements. Intangible assets consist of above- and below- market lease values and the value of in-place leases. Our purchase price allocations are developed utilizing third-party appraisal reports, industry standards and management experience. The risks and uncertainties involved in applying the principles related to purchase price allocations include, but are not limited to, the following:\n \u2022 The value allocated to land as opposed to buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements affects the amount of depreciation expense we record. If more value is attributed to land, depreciation expense is lower than if more value is attributed to buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements; \n \u2022 Intangible lease assets and liabilities can be significantly affected by estimates, including market rent, lease term including renewal options at rental rates below estimated market rental rates, carrying costs of the property during a hypothetical expected lease-up period, and current market conditions and costs, including tenant improvement allowances and rent concessions; and \n \u2022 We determine whether any financing assumed is above- or below- market based upon comparison to similar financing terms for similar investment properties. \nIncome Taxes\nAs a REIT, the General Partner generally is not subject to federal income tax on taxable income that it distributes to its shareholders as long as it distributes at least 90% of its annual taxable income (computed without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains), with the exception of its TRS entities. However, the General Partner, including its TRS entities, and the Operating Partnership are still subject to certain state and local income and franchise taxes in the various jurisdictions in which they operate.\nWe provide for income taxes in accordance with current authoritative accounting and tax guidance. The tax provision or benefit related to significant or unusual items is recognized in the quarter in which those items occur. In addition, the effect of changes in enacted tax laws, rates or tax status is recognized in the quarter in which the change occurs. The risks and uncertainties involved in applying the principles related to income taxes include, but are not limited to, the following:\n \u2022 Our calculations related to income taxes contain uncertainties due to judgment used to calculate tax liabilities in the application of complex tax laws and regulations across the tax jurisdictions where we operate; \n \u2022 We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, the Canadian federal jurisdiction and various state and local jurisdictions, and are subject to routine examinations by the respective tax authorities. We may be challenged upon review by the applicable taxing authorities, and positions we have taken may not be sustained; and \n \u2022 The accounting estimates used to compute the provision for or benefit from income taxes may change as new events occur, additional information is obtained or the tax environment changes. \nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements are described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements.\nOperating Highlights and Key Performance Indicators\n2017 Activity\n \u2022 Acquired controlling financial interests in 88 commercial properties and three land parcels for an aggregate purchase price of $748.8 million, which includes $3.3 million of external acquisition-related expenses that were capitalized and 22 properties acquired in a nonmonetary exchange. \n \u2022 Disposed of 137 properties, including six properties relinquished by foreclosure or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure transactions, for an aggregate sales price of $594.9 million, of which our share was $574.4 million, resulting in consolidated proceeds of $445.5 million after a mortgage loan assumption and closing costs, including 15 properties disposed of in connection with a nonmonetary exchange. \n \u2022 Total secured debt decreased by $579.9 million, from $2.7 billion to $2.1 billion. \n \u2022 Closed 2017 Bond Offering of $600.0 million and repaid all of the outstanding borrowings under our $500.0 million Credit Facility Term Loan. \n \u2022 Declared a quarterly dividend of $0.1375 per share of common stock for each quarter of 2017, representing an annualized dividend rate of $0.55 per share. \n \u2022 Entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell substantially all of Cole Capital. \nReal Estate Portfolio Metrics\nIn managing our portfolio, we are committed to diversification by property type, tenant, geography and industry.

The decrease in net property operating expenses of $8.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 was primarily due to the disposition of vacant properties and certain properties subject to double-net or modified gross leases.\n2016 vs 2015 - The net increase of $6.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to an increase in tenant vacancies, particularly related to Ovation Brands, Inc., which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on March 7, 2016.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\n2017 vs 2016 - The increase of $6.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 was primarily due to an increase of $6.8 million of compensation and benefits, including equity based compensation.\n2016 vs 2015 - The decrease of $15.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to a decrease of $8.2 million in consulting and other professional fees in 2016. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2016, accounting fees decreased $2.1 million, primarily due to the work performed during the first quarter of 2015 in connection with the restatements, and legal fees decreased $2.7 million, primarily due to costs incurred in 2015 related to strategic, tax and regulatory matters.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses\n2017 vs 2016 - The decrease of $55.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 was primarily due to the disposition of 438 consolidated properties subsequent to January 1, 2016.

In addition, the decrease was also due to management identifying certain properties for potential sale as part of its portfolio management strategy to reduce exposure to office properties during the year ended December 31, 2016 as well as the Ovation Bankruptcy during 2016.\n2016 vs 2015 - The increase in impairments of $91.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to management identifying certain properties for potential sale as part of its portfolio management strategy to reduce exposure to office properties, as well as the Ovation Bankruptcy.\nOther (Expense) Income, Income Tax (Provision) Benefit and Loss from Discontinued Operations\nThe table below sets forth, for the periods presented, certain financial information and the dollar amount change year over year (dollar amounts in thousands):\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs 2016\nIncrease/(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs 2015\nIncrease/(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(289,766\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(317,376\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(358,392\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(27,610\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(41,016\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain (loss) on extinguishment and forgiveness of debt, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(771\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,812\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,583\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,242\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,251\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>991\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,115\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reserve for loan loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15,300\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in income and gain on disposition of unconsolidated entities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,783\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,020\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>691\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,976\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,191\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,460\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>269\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain (loss) on disposition of real estate and real estate assets held for sale, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,524\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(72,311\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,882\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,136\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,589\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(254\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19,117\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(123,937\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(184,500\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Expense\n2017 vs 2016 - The decrease of $27.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to the repayment of the Credit Facility Term Loan of $500.0 million and a $579.9 million reduction of secured debt, partially offset by the issuance of $600.0 million of unsecured notes and net borrowings on the revolving credit facility of $185.0 million.\n2016 vs 2015 - The decrease of $41.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily a result of a decrease in the total outstanding debt balance from $8.1 billion as of December 31, 2015 to $6.4 billion as of December 31, 2016, largely due to the repayment of all outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility, repayment of $0.5 billion of the Credit Facility Term Loan, as well as reducing secured debt with proceeds from the public equity offering and property dispositions.\nGain (Loss) on Extinguishment and Forgiveness of Debt, Net\n2017 vs 2016 - The increase of $19.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 was primarily a result of three mortgage loans settled by foreclosure or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure for which the Company recognized a gain on forgiveness of debt of $20.5 million, with no comparable gains resulting from foreclosure or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure during the same period in 2016.\n2016 vs 2015 -

The Company recorded equity in loss related to its investments in the Cole REITs of $1.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to equity in income of $0.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nGain (Loss) on Derivative Instruments, Net\n2017 vs 2016 - The $4.2 million increase during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016, was primarily a result of the termination of six interest rate swaps in connection with the early repayment of the outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility Term Loan, as discussed in Note 11 - Derivatives and Hedging Activities to our consolidated financial statements, which resulted in a gain of $1.1 million as compared to a loss of $3.3 million in 2016.\n2016 vs 2015 - The decrease during the year ended December 31, 2016, is due to the termination of two interest rate swaps in connection with the early repayment of a portion of the Credit Facility Term Loan, which resulted in a loss of $3.3 million, offset by an increase in the fair value of the Company's interest rate swaps.\nGain (Loss) on Disposition of Real Estate and Real Estate Assets Held For Sale, Net\n2017 vs 2016 - The increase in gain on disposition of real estate and held for sale assets, net of $16.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016, was due to the Company's disposition of 131 properties, excluding six properties transferred to the lender in either a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure or foreclosure sale transaction, for an aggregate sales price of $594.9 million which resulted in a gain of $64.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the disposal of 301 properties for an aggregate sales price of $1.1 billion during the same period in 2016 for a gain of $50.6 million, which included $28.8 million of goodwill allocation related to the sales. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company also recognized a loss of $3.1 million related to assets classified as held for sale, as compared to a loss of $5.1 million during the same period in 2016.\n2016 vs 2015 - During the year ended December 31, 2016, the change of $117.8 million from a net loss on dispositions of real estate to a net gain was due to the Company's disposition of 301 properties for an aggregate sales price of $1.1 billion, which resulted in an aggregate gain of $50.6 million, as compared to the disposal of 228 properties for an aggregate sales price of $1.4 billion during the same period in 2015 for a loss of $69.1 million. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company also recorded a loss of $5.1 million related to assets classified as held for sale, as compared to a loss of $3.2 million during the same period in 2015.\nProvision for Income Taxes\n2017 vs 2016 - The consolidated provision for income taxes of $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to a provision of $7.1 million for the same period in 2016 reflects an overall decrease in expense attributable to higher state taxes in 2016 and tax on net income from properties held in and sold by a TRS in 2016, which were partially offset by tax on the gain on the sale of certain Canadian properties in 2017.\n2016 vs 2015 - The increase of $2.5 million is primarily due to the 2014 accrued state tax expense exceeding actual expenses incurred, resulting in a decrease to the provision for income taxes during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nLoss from Discontinued Operations\n2017 vs 2016 - During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell substantially all of the Cole Capital segment. The decrease in loss from discontinued operations of $104.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to decreases in impairment of goodwill of $120.9 million, in general and administrative expenses of $18.8 million and in amortization of intangible assets of $11.7 million, partially offset by the loss recognized on classification as held for sale of $20.0 million and an increase in the provision for income taxes of $24.7 million. Revenues, net of reallowed fees and commissions increased $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\n2016 vs 2015 - The decrease in loss from discontinued operations of $60.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to a decrease in impairment of intangible assets and goodwill of $92.4 million, offset by a decrease in the benefit from income taxes.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nOur results are presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as substitutes for any measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nFunds from Operations and Adjusted Funds from Operations\nDue to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, as discussed below, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc. ( NAREIT\u201d), an industry trade group, has promulgated a supplemental performance measure known as funds from operations ( FFO\u201d), which we believe to be an appropriate supplemental performance measure to reflect the operating performance of a REIT. FFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under U.S. GAAP.\nNAREIT defines FFO as net income or loss computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding gains or losses from disposition of property, depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and impairment write-downs on depreciable real estate including the pro rata share of adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. We calculated FFO in accordance with NAREIT's definition described above.\nIn addition to FFO, we use adjusted funds from operations ( AFFO\u201d) as a non-GAAP supplemental financial performance measure to evaluate the operating performance of the Company. AFFO, as defined by the Company, excludes from FFO non-routine items such as acquisition-related expenses, litigation, merger and other non-routine costs, net of insurance recoveries, held for sale loss on discontinued operations, gains or losses on sale of investment securities or mortgage notes receivable and legal settlements and insurance recoveries not in the ordinary course of business. We also exclude certain non-cash items such as impairments of goodwill and intangible assets, straight-line rent, net of bad debt expense related to straight-line rent, net direct financing lease adjustments, gains or losses on derivatives, reserves for loan loss, gains or losses on the extinguishment or forgiveness of debt, non-current portion of the tax benefit or expense, equity-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets, deferred financing costs, premiums and discounts on debt and investments, above-market lease assets and below-market lease liabilities. Effective January 1, 2017, we determined to omit the impact of the Excluded Properties and related non-recourse mortgage notes from FFO to calculate AFFO. We did not adjust AFFO during the years prior to January 1, 2017 as the impact was immaterial. Management believes that excluding these costs from FFO provides investors with supplemental performance information that is consistent with the performance models and analysis used by management, and provides investors a view of the performance of our portfolio over time. AFFO allows for a comparison of the performance of our operations with other publicly-traded REITs, as AFFO, or an equivalent measure, is routinely reported by publicly-traded REITs, and we believe often used by analysts and investors for comparison purposes.\nFor all of these reasons, we believe FFO and AFFO, in addition to net income (loss), as defined by U.S. GAAP, are helpful supplemental performance measures and useful in understanding the various ways in which our management evaluates the performance of the Company over time. However, not all REITs calculate FFO and AFFO the same way, so comparisons with other REITs may not be meaningful. FFO and AFFO should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) and are not intended to be used as a liquidity measure indicative of cash flow available to fund our cash needs. Neither the SEC, NAREIT, nor any other regulatory body has evaluated the acceptability of the exclusions used to adjust FFO in order to calculate AFFO and its use as a non-GAAP financial performance measure.\nThe table below presents FFO and AFFO for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands, except share and per share data) and includes both continuing operations, which primarily represent the Company's real estate operations, and discontinued operations, which represent substantially all of Cole Capital.\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>

non-current portion of the provision for or benefit from income taxes in order to show only the current portion of the provision for or benefit from income taxes as an impact to AFFO. For the three months ended December 31, 2017, this adjustment is net of a current tax benefit due to the acceleration of a bonus compensation-related deduction to take advantage of the Company's higher effective tax rate in 2017. As the Company already recognized the prior year bonus compensation-related tax deduction during the three months ended March 31, 2017, the acceleration of the 2018 benefit was not included in the computation of AFFO. \n (2) Dilutive securities include unvested restricted shares of common stock and unvested restricted stock units. \n (3) Weighted-average shares for all periods presented exclude the effect of the convertible debt as the Company would expect to settle the debt with cash. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nOur principal liquidity needs for the next twelve months and beyond are to:\n \u2022 fund normal operating expenses; \n \u2022 fund capital expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing costs \n \u2022 meet debt service and principal repayment obligations, including balloon payments on maturing debt; \n \u2022 pay dividends; \n \u2022 pay litigation costs and expenses; and \n \u2022 fund property and/or common stock acquisitions.  We expect to be able to satisfy these obligations using one or more of the following sources:\n \u2022 cash flow from operations; \n \u2022 proceeds from real estate dispositions; \n \u2022 utilization of existing line of credit; \n \u2022 cash and cash equivalents balance; and \n \u2022 issuance of VEREIT debt and equity securities.  2017 Bond Offering\nOn August 11, 2017, the Company closed a senior note offering, consisting of $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Operating Partnership's 3.950% Senior Notes due 2027. As discussed in Note 10 - Debt, the Company subsequently used a portion of the proceeds from the 2017 Bond Offering to repay borrowings, including swap termination costs and accrued unpaid interest under its $500.0 million Credit Facility Term Loan on August 11, 2017. The Company used the remaining proceeds to pay down secured debt.\nContinuous Equity Offering Program\nOn September 19, 2016, the Company registered a continuous equity offering program (the Program\u201d) pursuant to which the Company can offer and sell, from time to time through September 19, 2019 in at-the-market\u201d offerings or certain other transactions, shares of common stock with an aggregate gross sales price of up to $750.0 million, through its sales agents. The Company intends to use the proceeds from any sale of shares for general corporate purposes, which may include funding potential acquisitions and repurchasing or repaying outstanding indebtedness. As of December 31, 2017, no shares of common stock have been issued pursuant to the Program.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn May 12, 2017, the Company's board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $200.0 million of the Company's outstanding Common Stock over the subsequent 12 months, as market conditions warrant. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the Company repurchased 68,759 shares of common stock in multiple open transactions for $0.5 million.\nDisposition Activity\nAs part of our effort to optimize our real estate portfolio by focusing on holding core assets, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we disposed of 137 properties and six properties transferred to the lender in either a deed-in-lieu foreclosure or foreclosure sale transaction for an aggregate sales price of $594.9 million, of which our share was $574.4 million, resulting in consolidated proceeds of $445.5 million after mortgage loan assumption and closing costs. We expect to continue to explore opportunities to sell additional properties to provide us further financial flexibility and fund property acquisitions.\nCredit Facility\nSummary and Obligations\nWe, as guarantor, and the Operating Partnership, as borrower, are parties to the Credit Facility with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, and the other lenders party thereto.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Credit Facility had an outstanding balance of $185.0 million and allowed for maximum borrowings of $2.3 billion under its revolving credit facility, subject to borrowing availability. The maximum aggregate dollar amount of letters of credit that may be outstanding at any one time under the Credit Facility is $25.0 million. The Operating Partnership used a portion of the proceeds from the 2017 Bond Offering to repay all of the outstanding borrowings, including swap termination costs and accrued and unpaid interest, under its $500.0 million Credit Facility Term Loan on August 11, 2017.\nThe revolving credit facility generally bears interest at an annual rate of London Inter-Bank Offer Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) plus 1.00% to 1.80% or Base Rate plus 0.00% to 0.80% (based upon our then current credit rating). Base Rate\u201d is defined as the highest of the prime rate, the federal funds rate plus 0.50% or a floating rate based on one month LIBOR, determined on a daily basis. In addition, the Credit Agreement provides the flexibility for interest rate auctions, pursuant to which, at the Company's election, the Company may request that lenders make competitive bids to provide revolving loans, which competitive bids may be at pricing levels that differ from the foregoing interest rates.\nThe Credit Agreement provides for monthly interest payments under the Credit Facility. In the event of default, at the election of a majority of the lenders (or automatically upon a bankruptcy event of default with respect to the OP or the General Partner), the commitments of the lenders under the Credit Facility will mature, and payment of any unpaid amounts in respect of the Credit Facility will be accelerated. The Credit Facility terminates on June 30, 2018, unless extended in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement provides for a one-year extension option, exercisable at the Company's election and subject to certain customary conditions, as well as certain customary amend and extend\u201d provisions. At any time, upon timely notice by the OP and subject to any breakage fees, the OP may prepay borrowings under the Credit Facility (subject to certain limitations applicable to the prepayment of any loans obtained through an interest rate auction, as described above). The OP incurs a fee equal to 0.15% to 0.25% per annum (based upon the General Partner's then current credit rating) multiplied by the commitments (whether or not utilized) in respect of the revolving credit facility. In addition, the OP incurs customary administrative agent, letter of credit issuance, letter of credit fronting, extension and other fees.\nCredit Facility Covenants\nThe Credit Facility requires restrictions on corporate guarantees, as well as the maintenance of certain financial covenants. The key financial covenants in the Credit Facility, as defined and calculated per the terms of the Credit Agreement include maintaining the following:\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unsecured Credit Facility Key Covenants\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Required\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimum tangible net worth\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u2265 $5.5 B\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ratio of total indebtedness to total asset value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u2264 60%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ratio of adjusted EBITDA to fixed charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u2265 1.5x\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ratio of secured indebtedness to total asset value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u2264 45%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ratio of unsecured indebtedness to unencumbered asset value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u2264 60%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ratio of unencumbered adjusted NOI to unsecured interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u2265 1.75x\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimum unencumbered asset value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u2265 $8.0 B\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the purposes of determining unencumbered asset value, the Company is permitted to include restaurant properties representing up to 30% of its unencumbered asset value in such calculation.\nThe Company believes that it was in compliance with the financial covenants pursuant to the Credit Agreement and is not restricted from accessing any borrowing availability under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2017.\nCorporate Bonds\nSummary and Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2017, the OP had $2.85 billion aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes outstanding. The indenture governing the Senior Notes requires that the Company be in compliance with certain key financial covenants, including maintaining the following:\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate Bond Key Covenants\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Required\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Limitation on incurrence of total debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u2264 65%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Limitation on incurrence of secured debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u2264 40%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt service coverage ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u2265 1.5x\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance of total unencumbered assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u2265 150%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThere were no changes to the financial covenants of our existing Senior Notes during the year ended December 31, 2017. The covenants of our new Senior Notes issued in 2017 are materially the same as our then existing Senior Notes. As of December 31, 2017, the Company believes that it was in compliance with these financial covenants based on the covenant limits and calculations in place at that time.\nConvertible Debt\nSummary and Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes (as defined in Note 10 - Debt). The OP has issued corresponding identical convertible notes to the General Partner. There were no changes to the terms of the Convertible Notes and the Company believes it was in compliance with the financial covenants pursuant to the indenture governing the Convertible Notes as of December 31, 2017.\nMortgage Notes Payable and Other Debt\nSummary and Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had non-recourse mortgage indebtedness of $2.1 billion, which was collateralized by 472 properties, reflecting a decrease from December 31, 2016 of $558.9 million derived primarily from our disposition activity during the year ended December 31, 2017. Our mortgage indebtedness bore interest at the weighted-average rate of 4.92% per annum and had a weighted-average maturity of 4.1 years. We may in the future incur additional mortgage debt on the properties we currently own or use long-term non-recourse financing to acquire additional properties.\nThe payment terms of our loan obligations vary. In general, only interest amounts are payable monthly with all unpaid principal and interest due at maturity. Some of our loan agreements require that we comply with specific reporting and financial covenants mainly related to debt coverage ratios and loan-to-value ratios. Each loan that has these requirements has specific ratio thresholds that must be met.\nRestrictions on Loan Covenants\nOur mortgage loan obligations generally restrict corporate guarantees and require the maintenance of financial covenants, including maintenance of certain financial ratios (such as specified debt to equity and debt service coverage ratios), as well as the maintenance of a minimum net worth. The mortgage loan agreements contain no dividend restrictions except in the event of default or when a distribution would drive liquidity below the applicable thresholds. At December 31, 2017, the Company believes that it was in compliance with the financial covenants under the mortgage loan agreements, except for the $16.2 million loan in default as described above and in Note 10 - Debt\u201d to our consolidated financial statements.\nOther Debt\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company repaid the remaining outstanding principal balance on the secured term loan from KBC Bank, N.V. (the KBC Loan\u201d).\nDividends\nOn November 7, 2017, the Company's board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.1375 per share of common stock (equaling an annualized dividend rate of $0.55 per share) for the fourth quarter of 2017 to stockholders of record as of December 29, 2017, which was paid on January 16, 2018. An equivalent distribution by the Operating Partnership is applicable per OP unit.\nOur Series F Preferred Stock, as discussed in Note 15 - Equity\u201d to our consolidated financial statements, will pay cumulative cash dividends at the rate of 6.70% per annum on their liquidation preference of $25.00 per share (equivalent to $1.675 per share on an annual basis). As of December 31, 2017, there were approximately 42.8 million shares of Series F Preferred Stock (and approximately 42.8 million corresponding Series F Preferred Units that were issued to the General Partner) and 86,874 Limited Partner Series F Preferred Units that were issued and outstanding.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 (in thousands):\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal payments - mortgage notes (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,071,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>98,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>487,975\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>667,609\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>817,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments - mortgage notes (1) (2) (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>421,575\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100,177\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>176,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>108,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal payments - Credit Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>185,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>185,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments - Credit Facility (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal payments - corporate bonds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,850,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>750,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>400,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,700,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments - corporate bonds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>695,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>114,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>187,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>158,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>234,786\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal payments - convertible debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,000,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>597,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>402,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments - convertible debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating and ground lease commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>308,434\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>215,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,589,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,143,398\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,071,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,371,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,003,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________________________\n (1) For the loan in maturity default, as discussed in Note 10 - Debt , the payment obligations for future periods are based on an estimated extension of maturity to January 1, 2018. \n (2) As of December 31, 2017, we had $78.9 million of variable rate mortgage notes effectively fixed through the use of interest rate swap agreements. We used the effective interest rates fixed under our swap agreements to calculate the debt payment obligations in future periods. \n (3) Interest payments due in future periods on the $14.9 million of variable rate debt and the Credit Facility payment obligations were calculated using a forward LIBOR curve. \nCash Flow Analysis for the year ended December 31, 2017\nOperating Activities - During the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by operating activities decreased $4.7 million to $793.3 million from $797.9 million during the same period in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in rental receipts related to the disposition of 438 consolidated properties subsequent to January 1, 2016 and an increase in litigation and other non-routine costs paid during the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was mostly offset by a decrease in interest payments and insurance recoveries received as compared to the same period in 2016, the receipt of an income tax refund during the year ended December 31, 2017, and an increase in rental receipts related to the acquisition of 96 consolidated properties subsequent to January 1, 2016.\nInvesting Activities - Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 changed $1.2 billion to $274.1 million from cash provided by investing activities of $881.6 million during the same period in 2016. The change was primarily related to an increase in investments in real estate assets of $598.8 million, a decrease in cash proceeds from dispositions of real estate and joint ventures of $555.2 million.\nFinancing Activities - Net cash used in financing activities of $756.6 million decreased $750.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 from $1.5 billion during the same period in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in repayments of debt, net of proceeds, of $1.5 billion, which was partially offset by the 2016 common stock offering resulting in net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and offering costs, of $702.8 million and an increase in distributions paid of $28.1 million.\nCash Flow Analysis for the year ended December 31, 2016\nOperating Activities - During the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash provided by operating activities decreased $61.7 million to $797.9 million from $859.7 million during the same period in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in rental receipts related to the disposition of 529 consolidated properties subsequent to January 1, 2015. This decrease was partially offset by a decrease in interest payments and payments related to the Audit Committee Investigation and related litigation, net of insurance recoveries.\nInvesting Activities - Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased $59.8 million to $881.6 million from $941.4 million during the same period in 2015. The decrease was primarily related to an increase in investments in real estate assets of $63.9 million, an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture of $25.8 million during 2016 and a decrease in uses and refunds of deposits for real estate assets of $35.4 million. These decreases were partially offset by a decrease in real estate development payments of $40.3 million and the receipt of $50.0 million on the Affiliate Lines of Credit, as compared to $10.0 million in 2015.\nFinancing Activities - Net cash used in financing activities of $1.5 billion decreased $644.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 from $2.2 billion during the same period in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the 2016 common stock offering resulting in net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and offering costs, of $702.5 million and an increase in proceeds from debt, net of repayments, of $306.3 million, which were partially offset by an increase in distributions paid of $345.0 million\nElection as a REIT\nThe General Partner elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2011. As a REIT, except as discussed below, the General Partner generally is not subject to federal income tax on taxable income that it distributes to its stockholders so long as it distributes at least 90% of its annual taxable income (computed without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains). REITs are subject to a number of other organizational and operational requirements. Even if the General Partner maintains its qualification for taxation as a REIT, it may be subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and property, federal income taxes on certain income and excise taxes on its undistributed income. We believe we are organized and operating in such a manner as to qualify to be taxed as a REIT for the taxable year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe Operating Partnership is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, the Operating Partnership is not a taxable entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Instead, each partner in the Operating Partnership is required to take into account its allocable share of the Operating Partnership's income, gains, losses, deductions and credits for each taxable year. However, the Operating Partnership may be subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and property. Under the LPA, the Operating Partnership is required to conduct business in such a manner as to permit the General partner at all times to qualify as a REIT.\nThe Company conducted substantially all of its Cole Capital business activities through a TRS. A TRS is a subsidiary of a REIT that is subject to corporate federal, state and local income taxes, as applicable. The Company's use of a TRS enables it to engage in certain business activities while complying with the REIT qualification requirements and to retain any income generated by these businesses for reinvestment without the requirement to distribute those earnings. The Company conducts all of its business in the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada and, as a result, it files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, the Canadian federal jurisdiction and various state and local jurisdictions. Certain of the Company's inter-company transactions that have been eliminated in consolidation for financial accounting purposes are also subject to taxation.\nInflation\nWe may be adversely impacted by inflation on any leases that do not contain indexed escalation provisions. However, net leases that require the tenant to pay its allocable share of operating expenses, including common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes and insurance, may reduce our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation.\nRelated Party Transactions and Agreements\nThrough the closing of the Cole Capital sale, we were contractually responsible for managing the Cole REITs' affairs on a day-to-day basis, identifying and making acquisitions and investments on the Cole REITs' behalf, and recommending to each of the Cole REIT's respective board of directors an approach for providing investors with liquidity. In addition, we distributed the shares of common stock for certain of the Cole REITs and advised them regarding offerings, managed relationships with participating broker-dealers and financial advisors, and provided assistance in connection with compliance matters relating to the offerings. We received compensation and reimbursement for services relating to the Cole REITs' offerings and the investment, management and disposition of their respective assets, as applicable. See Note 17 - Related Party Transactions and Arrangements\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in this report for a further explanation of the various related party transactions, agreements and fees.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no material off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We make statements in this section that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. For a complete discussion of forward-looking statements, see the section in this report entitled Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d Certain risks may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the following discussion. For a discussion of such risk factors, see the section in this report entitled Risk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nVEREIT is a full-service real estate operating company which owns and manages one of the largest portfolios of single-tenant commercial properties in the U.S. The Company has 4,091 retail, restaurant, office and industrial operating properties with an aggregate 94.4 million square feet, of which 98.8% was leased as of December 31, 2017, with a weighted-average remaining lease term of 9.5 years.\nPrior to the fourth quarter of 2017, we operated through two business segments, our real estate investment segment and our investment management segment, Cole Capital, which sponsored and managed non-listed real estate investment trusts. On November 13, 2017, we entered into the Cole Capital Purchase and Sale Agreement to sell substantially all of the Cole Capital segment. The sale closed on February 1, 2018. Substantially all of the Cole Capital segment is presented as discontinued operations and the Company's remaining financial results are reported as a single segment for all periods presented. See Note 5 -Discontinued Operations, for further information on the sale of Cole Capital.\nEffective January 1, 2017, we determined that adjusted funds from operations ( AFFO\u201d), a non-GAAP measure, and our real estate portfolio and economic metrics, should exclude the impact of properties owned by the Company for the month beginning with the date that (i) the properties' related mortgage loan is in default and (ii) management decides to transfer the properties to the lender in connection with settling the mortgage note obligation, and ending with the disposition date (\"Excluded Properties\"), to better reflect our ongoing operations. Excluded Properties during the year ended December 31, 2017, were two vacant office properties and five industrial properties, two of which were vacant. Excluded Properties at December 31, 2017, included one vacant industrial property, comprised of 307,275 square feet, which secured a mortgage note payable, with debt outstanding of $16.2 million. The Company did not update data presented for prior periods for this change as it determined the impact on our prior periods was immaterial.\nOur Business Environment and Current Outlook\nCurrent conditions in the global capital markets remain volatile as the world's economic growth has been affected by geopolitical and economic events. In the United States, the overall economic environment continued to improve in 2017. During 2017, the U.S. real gross domestic product increased 2.3%, the unemployment rate decreased 0.6 percentage points to 4.1%, and Core CPI, a measure of inflation which removes food & energy prices and is seasonally adjusted, increased 1.8%, as compared to the same period a year earlier.\nEconomic trends and government policies affect global and regional commercial real estate markets as well as our operations directly. These include: overall economic activity and employment growth, interest rate levels, the cost and availability of credit and the impact of tax and regulatory policies.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Accounting Estimates\nOur accounting policies have been established to conform with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Management believes that we have made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate manner and in a way that accurately reflects our financial condition. We continually test and evaluate these estimates and assumptions using our historical knowledge of the business, as well as other factors, to ensure that they are reasonable for reporting purposes. However, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to the various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, thus resulting in a different presentation of the financial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different assumptions or estimates that may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. We believe the following critical accounting policies govern the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements, which should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies and procedures included in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements.\nGoodwill Impairment\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We adopted ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Others (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment ( ASU 2017-04\u201d), which simplifies the measurement of goodwill impairment by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test (comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill). The risks and uncertainties involved in applying the principles related to goodwill impairment include, but are not limited to, the following:\n \u2022 We estimate the fair value using discounted cash flows and relevant competitor multiples. \n \u2022 We monitor factors that may impact the fair value including market comparable company multiples, interest rates and global economic conditions. \n \u2022 We use a combined income and market approach in evaluations for potential impairment, which requires management to make key assumptions related to revenue growth rate, cash flow assumptions, discount rate and selection of comparable companies.  See Note 9 - Fair Value Measures\u201d for discussion regarding our sensitivity analysis performed around these assumptions.\nReal Estate Investment Impairment\nWe invest in real estate assets and subsequently monitor those investments quarterly for impairment, including the review of real estate properties subject to direct financing leases. Additionally, we record depreciation and amortization related to our investments. The risks and uncertainties involved in applying the principles related to real estate investments include, but are not limited to, the following:\n \u2022 The estimated useful lives of our depreciable assets affect the amount of depreciation and amortization recognized on our investments. \n \u2022 The review of impairment indicators and subsequent determination of the undiscounted future cash flows could require us to reduce the value of assets and recognize an impairment loss. \n \u2022 The fair value of held for sale assets is estimated by management. This estimated value could result in a reduction of the carrying value of the asset. \n \u2022 Changes in assumptions based on actual results may have a material impact on the Company's financial results.  Loans Held for Investment Impairment\nWe evaluate loans held for investment on a quarterly basis. As a first step in the notes receivable impairment process, we must determine, based on current information and events, if it is probable that we will be unable to collect the amounts due in accordance with the loan agreement. The risks and uncertainties involved in applying the principles related to notes receivable include, but are not limited to, the following:\n \u2022 Evaluating the financial condition and other current obligations of the borrower involves judgment in assessing their liquidity and financial stability.  Allocation of Purchase Price of Real Estate Assets\nIn connection with our acquisition of properties, we allocate the purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets and\nliabilities acquired based on their respective estimated fair values. Tangible assets consist of land, buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements. Intangible assets consist of above- and below- market lease values and the value of in-place leases. Our purchase price allocations are developed utilizing third-party appraisal reports, industry standards and management experience. The risks and uncertainties involved in applying the principles related to purchase price allocations include, but are not limited to, the following:\n \u2022 The value allocated to land as opposed to buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements affects the amount of depreciation expense we record. If more value is attributed to land, depreciation expense is lower than if more value is attributed to buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements; \n \u2022 Intangible lease assets and liabilities can be significantly affected by estimates, including market rent, lease term including renewal options at rental rates below estimated market rental rates, carrying costs of the property during a hypothetical expected lease-up period, and current market conditions and costs, including tenant improvement allowances and rent concessions; and \n \u2022 We determine whether any financing assumed is above- or below- market based upon comparison to similar financing terms for similar investment properties. \nIncome Taxes\nAs a REIT, the General Partner generally is not subject to federal income tax on taxable income that it distributes to its shareholders as long as it distributes at least 90% of its annual taxable income (computed without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains), with the exception of its TRS entities. However, the General Partner, including its TRS entities, and the Operating Partnership are still subject to certain state and local income and franchise taxes in the various jurisdictions in which they operate.\nWe provide for income taxes in accordance with current authoritative accounting and tax guidance. The tax provision or benefit related to significant or unusual items is recognized in the quarter in which those items occur. In addition, the effect of changes in enacted tax laws, rates or tax status is recognized in the quarter in which the change occurs. The risks and uncertainties involved in applying the principles related to income taxes include, but are not limited to, the following:\n \u2022 Our calculations related to income taxes contain uncertainties due to judgment used to calculate tax liabilities in the application of complex tax laws and regulations across the tax jurisdictions where we operate; \n \u2022 We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, the Canadian federal jurisdiction and various state and local jurisdictions, and are subject to routine examinations by the respective tax authorities. We may be challenged upon review by the applicable taxing authorities, and positions we have taken may not be sustained; and \n \u2022 The accounting estimates used to compute the provision for or benefit from income taxes may change as new events occur, additional information is obtained or the tax environment changes. \nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements are described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements.\nOperating Highlights and Key Performance Indicators\n2017 Activity\n \u2022 Acquired controlling financial interests in 88 commercial properties and three land parcels for an aggregate purchase price of $748.8 million, which includes $3.3 million of external acquisition-related expenses that were capitalized and 22 properties acquired in a nonmonetary exchange. \n \u2022 Disposed of 137 properties, including six properties relinquished by foreclosure or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure transactions, for an aggregate sales price of $594.9 million, of which our share was $574.4 million, resulting in consolidated proceeds of $445.5 million after a mortgage loan assumption and closing costs, including 15 properties disposed of in connection with a nonmonetary exchange. \n \u2022 Total secured debt decreased by $579.9 million, from $2.7 billion to $2.1 billion. \n \u2022 Closed 2017 Bond Offering of $600.0 million and repaid all of the outstanding borrowings under our $500.0 million Credit Facility Term Loan. \n \u2022 Declared a quarterly dividend of $0.1375 per share of common stock for each quarter of 2017, representing an annualized dividend rate of $0.55 per share. \n \u2022 Entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell substantially all of Cole Capital. \nReal Estate Portfolio Metrics\nIn managing our portfolio, we are committed to diversification by property type, tenant, geography and industry. Below is a summary of our operating property type diversification and our top ten concentrations as of December 31, 2017, based on annualized rental income of $1.2 billion,\nOur financial performance is influenced by the timing of acquisitions and dispositions and the operating performance of our real estate properties. The following table shows the property statistics of our operating properties, excluding properties owned through our unconsolidated joint ventures as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\n\n____________________________________\n (1) Omits the impact, if any, of the Excluded Properties. \n (2) Economic occupancy rate equals the sum of square feet leased (including space subject to month-to-month agreements) divided by total square feet. \n (3) Investment-grade tenants are those with a credit rating of BBB- or higher by Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC or a credit rating of Baa3 or higher by Moody's Investor Service, Inc. The ratings may reflect those assigned by Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC or Moody's Investor Service, Inc. to the lease guarantor or the parent company, as applicable.  The following table shows the economic metrics of our operating properties, excluding properties owned through our unconsolidated joint ventures, as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\n\n____________________________________\n (1) Omits the impact, if any, of the Excluded Properties. \n (2) Based on annualized rental income of our real estate portfolio as of December 31, 2017. \n (3) Through the end of the next five years as of the respective reporting date. \nOperating Performance\nIn addition, management uses the following financial metrics to assess our operating performance (dollar amounts in thousands, except per share amounts). Data presented includes both continuing operations, which primarily represent the Company's real estate operations, and discontinued operations, which represent substantially all of Cole Capital, except as otherwise indicated.\n\n____________________________________\n (1) Represents continuing operations as presented on the statement of operations in accordance with GAAP. \n (2) See Note 18 - Net Income (Loss) Per Share/Unit\u201d for calculation of net income (loss) per share. \n (3) See the Non-GAAP Measures\u201d section below for descriptions of our non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure. \nProperty Financing\nOur mortgage notes payable consisted of the following as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 (dollar amounts in thousands):\n\n_______________________________________________\n (1) Mortgage notes payable have fixed rates or are fixed by way of interest rate swap arrangements. Effective interest rates ranged from 3.1% to 7.2% at December 31, 2017, 2.00% to 7.75% at December 31, 2016, and 3.10% to 10.68% at December 31, 2015. \n (2) Weighted average interest rate is computed using the interest rate in effect until the anticipated repayment date. Should the loan not be repaid at the anticipated repayment date, the applicable interest rate would increase as specified in the respective loan agreement until the extended maturity date. \n (3) Weighted average years remaining to maturity is computed using the anticipated repayment date as specified in each loan agreement, where applicable. \n (4) Omits the Excluded Property and the related outstanding loan amount of $16.2 million and interest rate of 9.48%. \nIn addition, we have financing which is not secured by interests in real property, which is described under Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nFuture Lease Expirations\nThe following is a summary of lease expirations for the next 10 years and beyond at the operating properties we owned as of December 31, 2017 (dollar amounts and square feet in thousands):\n\n_______________________________________________\n (1) The Company has certain leases comprised of multiple properties. \nResults of Operations\nPrior to the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company operated through two business segments, the real estate investment segment and the investment management segment, Cole Capital. On November 13, 2017, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell substantially all of the Cole Capital segment. The sale closed on February 1, 2018. Substantially all of the Cole Capital segment is presented as discontinued operations and the Company's remaining financial results are reported as a single segment for all periods presented. The Company's continuing operations represent primarily those of the real estate investment segment.\nRental Income\nThe table below sets forth, for the periods presented, rental income information and the dollar amount change year over year (dollar amounts in thousands):\n\n2017 vs 2016 - The decrease in rental income of $75.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to the disposition of 438 consolidated properties subsequent to January 1, 2016.\n2016 vs 2015 - Rental revenue decreased $112.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, of which $105.6 million was due to the disposition of 529 consolidated properties subsequent to January 1, 2015. The decrease was also due to an increase in tenant vacancies, particularly Ovation Brands, Inc., which filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy on March 7, 2016 (the Ovation Bankruptcy\u201d).\nOperating Expenses\nThe table below sets forth, for the periods presented, certain operating expense information and the dollar amount change year over year (dollar amounts in thousands):\n\nAcquisition-Related Expenses\nSubsequent to the adoption of ASU 2017-01 as discussed in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements, acquisition-related expenses consist primarily of internal salaries allocated to acquisition-related activities and costs incurred for deals that were not consummated.\n2017 vs 2016 - The increase of $2.1 million in acquisition-related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016 was primarily due to an increase in allocated internal salaries resulting from time spent on acquiring commercial properties during the year ended December 31, 2017. The Company resumed property acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2016 and acquired 88 properties and three land parcels for an aggregate purchase price of $748.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017.\n2016 vs 2015 - The Company acquired an interest in eight commercial properties for a purchase price of $100.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared with the acquisition of 16 properties for an aggregate purchase price of $36.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in acquisition related expenses of $4.9 million during the year\nended December 31, 2016 was due to a decrease in costs incurred for deals that were not consummated and fewer properties acquired in 2016.\nLitigation, Merger and Other Non-routine Costs, Net of Insurance Recoveries\n2017 vs 2016 - The increase of $44.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 was due to an increase of $25.2 million in legal fees incurred related to the Audit Committee Investigation and related litigation and investigations during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016. Additionally, the Company recognized $21.2 million of insurance recoveries during the year ended December 31, 2016, of which $10.5 million related to litigation resulting from prior mergers and $10.7 million related to the Audit Committee Investigation and related litigation and investigations. No insurance recoveries were recognized during the year ended December 31, 2017 related to the litigation resulting from prior mergers.\n2016 vs 2015 - The decrease of $29.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to a $20 million decrease in legal fees incurred for litigation arising from the results of the Audit Committee Investigation and related litigation and investigations. Additionally, the Company recognized insurance recoveries of $21.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $11.4 million in 2015.\nProperty Operating Expenses and Operating Expense Reimbursements\nThe table below sets forth, for the periods presented, the property operating expenses, net of operating expense reimbursements, and the dollar amount change year over year (dollar amounts in thousands):\n\n2017 vs 2016 - Property operating expenses such as taxes, insurance, ground rent and maintenance include both reimbursable and non-reimbursable property expenses. Operating expense reimbursement revenue represents reimbursements for such costs that are reimbursable by the tenants per their respective leases. The decrease in net property operating expenses of $8.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 was primarily due to the disposition of vacant properties and certain properties subject to double-net or modified gross leases.\n2016 vs 2015 - The net increase of $6.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to an increase in tenant vacancies, particularly related to Ovation Brands, Inc., which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on March 7, 2016.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\n2017 vs 2016 - The increase of $6.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 was primarily due to an increase of $6.8 million of compensation and benefits, including equity based compensation.\n2016 vs 2015 - The decrease of $15.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to a decrease of $8.2 million in consulting and other professional fees in 2016. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2016, accounting fees decreased $2.1 million, primarily due to the work performed during the first quarter of 2015 in connection with the restatements, and legal fees decreased $2.7 million, primarily due to costs incurred in 2015 related to strategic, tax and regulatory matters.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses\n2017 vs 2016 - The decrease of $55.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 was primarily due to the disposition of 438 consolidated properties subsequent to January 1, 2016. The Company also recorded $50.5 million and $182.8 million of impairment charges on real estate investments during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which reduced the carrying value being depreciated and amortized.\n2016 vs 2015 - The decrease of $59.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily related to the disposition of 529 consolidated properties subsequent to January 1, 2015. The Company also recorded $182.8 million and $91.8 million of impairment charges on real estate investments during the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which reduced the carrying value being depreciated and amortized.\nImpairments\n2017 vs 2016 - The decrease in impairments of $132.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 was primarily due to a decrease in the number of properties impaired from 153 during the year ended December 31, 2016 to 69 properties during the year ended December 31, 2017. In addition, the decrease was also due to management identifying certain properties for potential sale as part of its portfolio management strategy to reduce exposure to office properties during the year ended December 31, 2016 as well as the Ovation Bankruptcy during 2016.\n2016 vs 2015 - The increase in impairments of $91.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to management identifying certain properties for potential sale as part of its portfolio management strategy to reduce exposure to office properties, as well as the Ovation Bankruptcy.\nOther (Expense) Income, Income Tax (Provision) Benefit and Loss from Discontinued Operations\nThe table below sets forth, for the periods presented, certain financial information and the dollar amount change year over year (dollar amounts in thousands):\n\nInterest Expense\n2017 vs 2016 - The decrease of $27.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to the repayment of the Credit Facility Term Loan of $500.0 million and a $579.9 million reduction of secured debt, partially offset by the issuance of $600.0 million of unsecured notes and net borrowings on the revolving credit facility of $185.0 million.\n2016 vs 2015 - The decrease of $41.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily a result of a decrease in the total outstanding debt balance from $8.1 billion as of December 31, 2015 to $6.4 billion as of December 31, 2016, largely due to the repayment of all outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility, repayment of $0.5 billion of the Credit Facility Term Loan, as well as reducing secured debt with proceeds from the public equity offering and property dispositions.\nGain (Loss) on Extinguishment and Forgiveness of Debt, Net\n2017 vs 2016 - The increase of $19.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 was primarily a result of three mortgage loans settled by foreclosure or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure for which the Company recognized a gain on forgiveness of debt of $20.5 million, with no comparable gains resulting from foreclosure or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure during the same period in 2016.\n2016 vs 2015 - During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded a loss of $0.8 million in relation to the write-off of deferred financing costs and net premiums consisting of losses relating to the early extinguishment of our 2017 Senior Notes of $13.2 million and the prepayment of a portion of the Credit Facility Term Loan of $4.3 million, as well as the 2016 Term Loan of $2.6 million, as discussed in Note 10 - Debt\u201d to our consolidated financial statements. These losses were partially offset by a gain on forgiveness of debt of $19.1 million related to a mortgage loan settled by foreclosure. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded a gain on forgiveness of debt of $4.8 million related to the foreclosure of one property.\nOther Income, Net\n2017 vs 2016 - The increase of $1.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 was primarily due to post-closing adjustments, of $1.6 million, recorded in accordance with the purchase and sale agreement during the year ended December 31, 2016 related to a multi-tenant asset portfolio sale completed in 2014, offset by a decrease in interest income related to the Company's investment securities and mortgage notes receivable of $0.6 million.\n2016 vs 2015 - The decrease of $4.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily a result of a decrease in disposition fees earned from 1031 real estate programs of $3.8 million.\nReserve for Loan Loss\nThe reserve for loan loss of $15.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 related to an unsecured note from RCS Capital Corporation in connection with the unconsummated sale of Cole Capital. During the three months ended December 31, 2015, the Company assessed the collectability of the note, determined it was unlikely to be repaid and recorded the reserve equal to the carrying value of the note.\nEquity in Income and Gain on Disposition of Unconsolidated Entities\n2017 vs 2016 - The decrease of $7.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 was primarily the result of a gain of $10.2 million recognized on the disposition of one unconsolidated joint venture owning one property in 2016, with no comparable gain in 2017.\n2016 vs 2015 - Equity in income (loss) and gain on disposition of unconsolidated entities increased $0.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded a gain of $10.2 million related to the disposition of one property, comprising 343 million square feet of office space, owned by an unconsolidated joint venture. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded a gain of $6.7 million related to the disposition of its interest in one consolidated joint venture, whose only assets consisted of investments in three unconsolidated joint ventures that owned three properties, comprising 752 million square feet of retail space. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized $0.9 million and $2.3 million of net income, respectively, from the unconsolidated joint ventures. The Company recorded equity in loss related to its investments in the Cole REITs of $1.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to equity in income of $0.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nGain (Loss) on Derivative Instruments, Net\n2017 vs 2016 - The $4.2 million increase during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016, was primarily a result of the termination of six interest rate swaps in connection with the early repayment of the outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility Term Loan, as discussed in Note 11 - Derivatives and Hedging Activities to our consolidated financial statements, which resulted in a gain of $1.1 million as compared to a loss of $3.3 million in 2016.\n2016 vs 2015 - The decrease during the year ended December 31, 2016, is due to the termination of two interest rate swaps in connection with the early repayment of a portion of the Credit Facility Term Loan, which resulted in a loss of $3.3 million, offset by an increase in the fair value of the Company's interest rate swaps.\nGain (Loss) on Disposition of Real Estate and Real Estate Assets Held For Sale, Net\n2017 vs 2016 - The increase in gain on disposition of real estate and held for sale assets, net of $16.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016, was due to the Company's disposition of 131 properties, excluding six properties transferred to the lender in either a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure or foreclosure sale transaction, for an aggregate sales price of $594.9 million which resulted in a gain of $64.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the disposal of 301 properties for an aggregate sales price of $1.1 billion during the same period in 2016 for a gain of $50.6 million, which included $28.8 million of goodwill allocation related to the sales. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company also recognized a loss of $3.1 million related to assets classified as held for sale, as compared to a loss of $5.1 million during the same period in 2016.\n2016 vs 2015 - During the year ended December 31, 2016, the change of $117.8 million from a net loss on dispositions of real estate to a net gain was due to the Company's disposition of 301 properties for an aggregate sales price of $1.1 billion, which resulted in an aggregate gain of $50.6 million, as compared to the disposal of 228 properties for an aggregate sales price of $1.4 billion during the same period in 2015 for a loss of $69.1 million. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company also recorded a loss of $5.1 million related to assets classified as held for sale, as compared to a loss of $3.2 million during the same period in 2015.\nProvision for Income Taxes\n2017 vs 2016 - The consolidated provision for income taxes of $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to a provision of $7.1 million for the same period in 2016 reflects an overall decrease in expense attributable to higher state taxes in 2016 and tax on net income from properties held in and sold by a TRS in 2016, which were partially offset by tax on the gain on the sale of certain Canadian properties in 2017.\n2016 vs 2015 - The increase of $2.5 million is primarily due to the 2014 accrued state tax expense exceeding actual expenses incurred, resulting in a decrease to the provision for income taxes during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nLoss from Discontinued Operations\n2017 vs 2016 - During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell substantially all of the Cole Capital segment. The decrease in loss from discontinued operations of $104.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to decreases in impairment of goodwill of $120.9 million, in general and administrative expenses of $18.8 million and in amortization of intangible assets of $11.7 million, partially offset by the loss recognized on classification as held for sale of $20.0 million and an increase in the provision for income taxes of $24.7 million. Revenues, net of reallowed fees and commissions increased $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\n2016 vs 2015 - The decrease in loss from discontinued operations of $60.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to a decrease in impairment of intangible assets and goodwill of $92.4 million, offset by a decrease in the benefit from income taxes.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nOur results are presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We also disclose certain non-GAAP measures, as discussed further below. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in our internal analysis of results and believes these measures are useful to investors for the reasons explained below. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as substitutes for any measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nFunds from Operations and Adjusted Funds from Operations\nDue to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, as discussed below, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc. ( NAREIT\u201d), an industry trade group, has promulgated a supplemental performance measure known as funds from operations ( FFO\u201d), which we believe to be an appropriate supplemental performance measure to reflect the operating performance of a REIT. FFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under U.S. GAAP.\nNAREIT defines FFO as net income or loss computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding gains or losses from disposition of property, depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and impairment write-downs on depreciable real estate including the pro rata share of adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. We calculated FFO in accordance with NAREIT's definition described above.\nIn addition to FFO, we use adjusted funds from operations ( AFFO\u201d) as a non-GAAP supplemental financial performance measure to evaluate the operating performance of the Company. AFFO, as defined by the Company, excludes from FFO non-routine items such as acquisition-related expenses, litigation, merger and other non-routine costs, net of insurance recoveries, held for sale loss on discontinued operations, gains or losses on sale of investment securities or mortgage notes receivable and legal settlements and insurance recoveries not in the ordinary course of business. We also exclude certain non-cash items such as impairments of goodwill and intangible assets, straight-line rent, net of bad debt expense related to straight-line rent, net direct financing lease adjustments, gains or losses on derivatives, reserves for loan loss, gains or losses on the extinguishment or forgiveness of debt, non-current portion of the tax benefit or expense, equity-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets, deferred financing costs, premiums and discounts on debt and investments, above-market lease assets and below-market lease liabilities. Effective January 1, 2017, we determined to omit the impact of the Excluded Properties and related non-recourse mortgage notes from FFO to calculate AFFO. We did not adjust AFFO during the years prior to January 1, 2017 as the impact was immaterial. Management believes that excluding these costs from FFO provides investors with supplemental performance information that is consistent with the performance models and analysis used by management, and provides investors a view of the performance of our portfolio over time. AFFO allows for a comparison of the performance of our operations with other publicly-traded REITs, as AFFO, or an equivalent measure, is routinely reported by publicly-traded REITs, and we believe often used by analysts and investors for comparison purposes.\nFor all of these reasons, we believe FFO and AFFO, in addition to net income (loss), as defined by U.S. GAAP, are helpful supplemental performance measures and useful in understanding the various ways in which our management evaluates the performance of the Company over time. However, not all REITs calculate FFO and AFFO the same way, so comparisons with other REITs may not be meaningful. FFO and AFFO should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) and are not intended to be used as a liquidity measure indicative of cash flow available to fund our cash needs. Neither the SEC, NAREIT, nor any other regulatory body has evaluated the acceptability of the exclusions used to adjust FFO in order to calculate AFFO and its use as a non-GAAP financial performance measure.\nThe table below presents FFO and AFFO for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands, except share and per share data) and includes both continuing operations, which primarily represent the Company's real estate operations, and discontinued operations, which represent substantially all of Cole Capital.\n\n____________________________________\n (1) This adjustment represents the non-current portion of the provision for or benefit from income taxes in order to show only the current portion of the provision for or benefit from income taxes as an impact to AFFO. For the three months ended December 31, 2017, this adjustment is net of a current tax benefit due to the acceleration of a bonus compensation-related deduction to take advantage of the Company's higher effective tax rate in 2017. As the Company already recognized the prior year bonus compensation-related tax deduction during the three months ended March 31, 2017, the acceleration of the 2018 benefit was not included in the computation of AFFO. \n (2) Dilutive securities include unvested restricted shares of common stock and unvested restricted stock units. \n (3) Weighted-average shares for all periods presented exclude the effect of the convertible debt as the Company would expect to settle the debt with cash. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nOur principal liquidity needs for the next twelve months and beyond are to:\n \u2022 fund normal operating expenses; \n \u2022 fund capital expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing costs \n \u2022 meet debt service and principal repayment obligations, including balloon payments on maturing debt; \n \u2022 pay dividends; \n \u2022 pay litigation costs and expenses; and \n \u2022 fund property and/or common stock acquisitions.  We expect to be able to satisfy these obligations using one or more of the following sources:\n \u2022 cash flow from operations; \n \u2022 proceeds from real estate dispositions; \n \u2022 utilization of existing line of credit; \n \u2022 cash and cash equivalents balance; and \n \u2022 issuance of VEREIT debt and equity securities.  2017 Bond Offering\nOn August 11, 2017, the Company closed a senior note offering, consisting of $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Operating Partnership's 3.950% Senior Notes due 2027. As discussed in Note 10 - Debt, the Company subsequently used a portion of the proceeds from the 2017 Bond Offering to repay borrowings, including swap termination costs and accrued unpaid interest under its $500.0 million Credit Facility Term Loan on August 11, 2017. The Company used the remaining proceeds to pay down secured debt.\nContinuous Equity Offering Program\nOn September 19, 2016, the Company registered a continuous equity offering program (the Program\u201d) pursuant to which the Company can offer and sell, from time to time through September 19, 2019 in at-the-market\u201d offerings or certain other transactions, shares of common stock with an aggregate gross sales price of up to $750.0 million, through its sales agents. The Company intends to use the proceeds from any sale of shares for general corporate purposes, which may include funding potential acquisitions and repurchasing or repaying outstanding indebtedness. As of December 31, 2017, no shares of common stock have been issued pursuant to the Program.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn May 12, 2017, the Company's board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $200.0 million of the Company's outstanding Common Stock over the subsequent 12 months, as market conditions warrant. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the Company repurchased 68,759 shares of common stock in multiple open transactions for $0.5 million.\nDisposition Activity\nAs part of our effort to optimize our real estate portfolio by focusing on holding core assets, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we disposed of 137 properties and six properties transferred to the lender in either a deed-in-lieu foreclosure or foreclosure sale transaction for an aggregate sales price of $594.9 million, of which our share was $574.4 million, resulting in consolidated proceeds of $445.5 million after mortgage loan assumption and closing costs. We expect to continue to explore opportunities to sell additional properties to provide us further financial flexibility and fund property acquisitions.\nCredit Facility\nSummary and Obligations\nWe, as guarantor, and the Operating Partnership, as borrower, are parties to the Credit Facility with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, and the other lenders party thereto.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Credit Facility had an outstanding balance of $185.0 million and allowed for maximum borrowings of $2.3 billion under its revolving credit facility, subject to borrowing availability. The maximum aggregate dollar amount of letters of credit that may be outstanding at any one time under the Credit Facility is $25.0 million. The Operating Partnership used a portion of the proceeds from the 2017 Bond Offering to repay all of the outstanding borrowings, including swap termination costs and accrued and unpaid interest, under its $500.0 million Credit Facility Term Loan on August 11, 2017.\nThe revolving credit facility generally bears interest at an annual rate of London Inter-Bank Offer Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) plus 1.00% to 1.80% or Base Rate plus 0.00% to 0.80% (based upon our then current credit rating). Base Rate\u201d is defined as the highest of the prime rate, the federal funds rate plus 0.50% or a floating rate based on one month LIBOR, determined on a daily basis. In addition, the Credit Agreement provides the flexibility for interest rate auctions, pursuant to which, at the Company's election, the Company may request that lenders make competitive bids to provide revolving loans, which competitive bids may be at pricing levels that differ from the foregoing interest rates.\nThe Credit Agreement provides for monthly interest payments under the Credit Facility. In the event of default, at the election of a majority of the lenders (or automatically upon a bankruptcy event of default with respect to the OP or the General Partner), the commitments of the lenders under the Credit Facility will mature, and payment of any unpaid amounts in respect of the Credit Facility will be accelerated. The Credit Facility terminates on June 30, 2018, unless extended in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement provides for a one-year extension option, exercisable at the Company's election and subject to certain customary conditions, as well as certain customary amend and extend\u201d provisions. At any time, upon timely notice by the OP and subject to any breakage fees, the OP may prepay borrowings under the Credit Facility (subject to certain limitations applicable to the prepayment of any loans obtained through an interest rate auction, as described above). The OP incurs a fee equal to 0.15% to 0.25% per annum (based upon the General Partner's then current credit rating) multiplied by the commitments (whether or not utilized) in respect of the revolving credit facility. In addition, the OP incurs customary administrative agent, letter of credit issuance, letter of credit fronting, extension and other fees.\nCredit Facility Covenants\nThe Credit Facility requires restrictions on corporate guarantees, as well as the maintenance of certain financial covenants. The key financial covenants in the Credit Facility, as defined and calculated per the terms of the Credit Agreement include maintaining the following:\n\nFor the purposes of determining unencumbered asset value, the Company is permitted to include restaurant properties representing up to 30% of its unencumbered asset value in such calculation.\nThe Company believes that it was in compliance with the financial covenants pursuant to the Credit Agreement and is not restricted from accessing any borrowing availability under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2017.\nCorporate Bonds\nSummary and Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2017, the OP had $2.85 billion aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes outstanding. The indenture governing the Senior Notes requires that the Company be in compliance with certain key financial covenants, including maintaining the following:\n\nThere were no changes to the financial covenants of our existing Senior Notes during the year ended December 31, 2017. The covenants of our new Senior Notes issued in 2017 are materially the same as our then existing Senior Notes. As of December 31, 2017, the Company believes that it was in compliance with these financial covenants based on the covenant limits and calculations in place at that time.\nConvertible Debt\nSummary and Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes (as defined in Note 10 - Debt). The OP has issued corresponding identical convertible notes to the General Partner. There were no changes to the terms of the Convertible Notes and the Company believes it was in compliance with the financial covenants pursuant to the indenture governing the Convertible Notes as of December 31, 2017.\nMortgage Notes Payable and Other Debt\nSummary and Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had non-recourse mortgage indebtedness of $2.1 billion, which was collateralized by 472 properties, reflecting a decrease from December 31, 2016 of $558.9 million derived primarily from our disposition activity during the year ended December 31, 2017. Our mortgage indebtedness bore interest at the weighted-average rate of 4.92% per annum and had a weighted-average maturity of 4.1 years. We may in the future incur additional mortgage debt on the properties we currently own or use long-term non-recourse financing to acquire additional properties.\nThe payment terms of our loan obligations vary. In general, only interest amounts are payable monthly with all unpaid principal and interest due at maturity. Some of our loan agreements require that we comply with specific reporting and financial covenants mainly related to debt coverage ratios and loan-to-value ratios. Each loan that has these requirements has specific ratio thresholds that must be met.\nRestrictions on Loan Covenants\nOur mortgage loan obligations generally restrict corporate guarantees and require the maintenance of financial covenants, including maintenance of certain financial ratios (such as specified debt to equity and debt service coverage ratios), as well as the maintenance of a minimum net worth. The mortgage loan agreements contain no dividend restrictions except in the event of default or when a distribution would drive liquidity below the applicable thresholds. At December 31, 2017, the Company believes that it was in compliance with the financial covenants under the mortgage loan agreements, except for the $16.2 million loan in default as described above and in Note 10 - Debt\u201d to our consolidated financial statements.\nOther Debt\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company repaid the remaining outstanding principal balance on the secured term loan from KBC Bank, N.V. (the KBC Loan\u201d).\nDividends\nOn November 7, 2017, the Company's board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.1375 per share of common stock (equaling an annualized dividend rate of $0.55 per share) for the fourth quarter of 2017 to stockholders of record as of December 29, 2017, which was paid on January 16, 2018. An equivalent distribution by the Operating Partnership is applicable per OP unit.\nOur Series F Preferred Stock, as discussed in Note 15 - Equity\u201d to our consolidated financial statements, will pay cumulative cash dividends at the rate of 6.70% per annum on their liquidation preference of $25.00 per share (equivalent to $1.675 per share on an annual basis). As of December 31, 2017, there were approximately 42.8 million shares of Series F Preferred Stock (and approximately 42.8 million corresponding Series F Preferred Units that were issued to the General Partner) and 86,874 Limited Partner Series F Preferred Units that were issued and outstanding.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 (in thousands):\n\n____________________________________\n (1) For the loan in maturity default, as discussed in Note 10 - Debt , the payment obligations for future periods are based on an estimated extension of maturity to January 1, 2018. \n (2) As of December 31, 2017, we had $78.9 million of variable rate mortgage notes effectively fixed through the use of interest rate swap agreements. We used the effective interest rates fixed under our swap agreements to calculate the debt payment obligations in future periods. \n (3) Interest payments due in future periods on the $14.9 million of variable rate debt and the Credit Facility payment obligations were calculated using a forward LIBOR curve. \nCash Flow Analysis for the year ended December 31, 2017\nOperating Activities - During the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by operating activities decreased $4.7 million to $793.3 million from $797.9 million during the same period in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in rental receipts related to the disposition of 438 consolidated properties subsequent to January 1, 2016 and an increase in litigation and other non-routine costs paid during the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was mostly offset by a decrease in interest payments and insurance recoveries received as compared to the same period in 2016, the receipt of an income tax refund during the year ended December 31, 2017, and an increase in rental receipts related to the acquisition of 96 consolidated properties subsequent to January 1, 2016.\nInvesting Activities - Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 changed $1.2 billion to $274.1 million from cash provided by investing activities of $881.6 million during the same period in 2016. The change was primarily related to an increase in investments in real estate assets of $598.8 million, a decrease in cash proceeds from dispositions of real estate and joint ventures of $555.2 million.\nFinancing Activities - Net cash used in financing activities of $756.6 million decreased $750.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 from $1.5 billion during the same period in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in repayments of debt, net of proceeds, of $1.5 billion, which was partially offset by the 2016 common stock offering resulting in net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and offering costs, of $702.8 million and an increase in distributions paid of $28.1 million.\nCash Flow Analysis for the year ended December 31, 2016\nOperating Activities - During the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash provided by operating activities decreased $61.7 million to $797.9 million from $859.7 million during the same period in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in rental receipts related to the disposition of 529 consolidated properties subsequent to January 1, 2015. This decrease was partially offset by a decrease in interest payments and payments related to the Audit Committee Investigation and related litigation, net of insurance recoveries.\nInvesting Activities - Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased $59.8 million to $881.6 million from $941.4 million during the same period in 2015. The decrease was primarily related to an increase in investments in real estate assets of $63.9 million, an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture of $25.8 million during 2016 and a decrease in uses and refunds of deposits for real estate assets of $35.4 million. These decreases were partially offset by a decrease in real estate development payments of $40.3 million and the receipt of $50.0 million on the Affiliate Lines of Credit, as compared to $10.0 million in 2015.\nFinancing Activities - Net cash used in financing activities of $1.5 billion decreased $644.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 from $2.2 billion during the same period in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the 2016 common stock offering resulting in net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and offering costs, of $702.5 million and an increase in proceeds from debt, net of repayments, of $306.3 million, which were partially offset by an increase in distributions paid of $345.0 million\nElection as a REIT\nThe General Partner elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2011. As a REIT, except as discussed below, the General Partner generally is not subject to federal income tax on taxable income that it distributes to its stockholders so long as it distributes at least 90% of its annual taxable income (computed without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains). REITs are subject to a number of other organizational and operational requirements. Even if the General Partner maintains its qualification for taxation as a REIT, it may be subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and property, federal income taxes on certain income and excise taxes on its undistributed income. We believe we are organized and operating in such a manner as to qualify to be taxed as a REIT for the taxable year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe Operating Partnership is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, the Operating Partnership is not a taxable entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Instead, each partner in the Operating Partnership is required to take into account its allocable share of the Operating Partnership's income, gains, losses, deductions and credits for each taxable year. However, the Operating Partnership may be subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and property. Under the LPA, the Operating Partnership is required to conduct business in such a manner as to permit the General partner at all times to qualify as a REIT.\nThe Company conducted substantially all of its Cole Capital business activities through a TRS. A TRS is a subsidiary of a REIT that is subject to corporate federal, state and local income taxes, as applicable. The Company's use of a TRS enables it to engage in certain business activities while complying with the REIT qualification requirements and to retain any income generated by these businesses for reinvestment without the requirement to distribute those earnings. The Company conducts all of its business in the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada and, as a result, it files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, the Canadian federal jurisdiction and various state and local jurisdictions. Certain of the Company's inter-company transactions that have been eliminated in consolidation for financial accounting purposes are also subject to taxation.\nInflation\nWe may be adversely impacted by inflation on any leases that do not contain indexed escalation provisions. However, net leases that require the tenant to pay its allocable share of operating expenses, including common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes and insurance, may reduce our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation.\nRelated Party Transactions and Agreements\nThrough the closing of the Cole Capital sale, we were contractually responsible for managing the Cole REITs' affairs on a day-to-day basis, identifying and making acquisitions and investments on the Cole REITs' behalf, and recommending to each of the Cole REIT's respective board of directors an approach for providing investors with liquidity. In addition, we distributed the shares of common stock for certain of the Cole REITs and advised them regarding offerings, managed relationships with participating broker-dealers and financial advisors, and provided assistance in connection with compliance matters relating to the offerings. We received compensation and reimbursement for services relating to the Cole REITs' offerings and the investment, management and disposition of their respective assets, as applicable. See Note 17 - Related Party Transactions and Arrangements\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in this report for a further explanation of the various related party transactions, agreements and fees.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no material off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.", "item_7_tables": "Table 140: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>

report is the Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) section from the annual 10-K filing of VEREIT, a full-service real estate operating company. The report provides a detailed explanation of the company's financial condition and results of operations, and should be read with the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n\nHighlights from the report include:\n\n- VEREIT owns and manages a large portfolio of single-tenant commercial properties across the U.S., composed predominantly of retail, restaurant, office, and industrial properties.\n- The company underwent a restructuring, selling off its investment management segment, Cole Capital, and presenting it as discontinued operations in the financial statements.\n- VEREIT has modified its adjusted funds from operations (AFFO), a non-GAAP measure, to exclude the impact of properties related to defaulted mortgage loans or properties they intend to surrender to lenders.\n- Economic conditions in the U.S. improved in 2017, reflected by increases in GDP, a decrease in the unemployment rate, and a slight increase in core CPI.\n- VEREIT underscores its critical accounting policies and estimates that are significant to the preparation of financial statements, particularly those requiring judgment and estimation.\n- The company evaluates real estate investments and loans held for investment for impairment quarterly and performs goodwill impairment testing annually or more frequently if triggering events occur.\n- During 2017, VEREIT made several notable financial transactions including property acquisitions, property disposals, the closing of a bond offering, and repayment of a term loan. Dividends per share for 2017 were maintained at $0.1375 per quarter.\n- The company operates primarily in the U.S., is subject to various state and local taxes, and has elected to be taxed as a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT).\n- VEREIT was compliant with all financial covenants from its borrowings as of December 31, 2017, and believes to be organized and operating in accordance with qualifications needed to be taxed as a REIT.\n\nThe report also includes various financial statements, metrics, and disclosures about risks, accounting policies, property financing, and lease expiration profiles amongst other information. This summary captures the essential elements of the MD&A but does not contain all specifics and quantitative disclosures. For a full understanding, the original report should be consulted."}
