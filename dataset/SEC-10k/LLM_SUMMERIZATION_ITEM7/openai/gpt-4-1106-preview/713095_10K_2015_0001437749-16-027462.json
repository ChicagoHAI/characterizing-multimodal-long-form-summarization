Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGlossary of Financial Terms\nAllowance for loan losses\nA valuation allowance to offset credit losses specifically identified in the loan portfolio, as well as management's best estimate of probable incurred losses in the remainder of the portfolio at the balance sheet date. Management estimates the allowance balance required using past loan loss experience, an assessment of the financial condition of individual borrowers, a determination of the value and adequacy of underlying collateral, the condition of the local economy, an analysis of the levels and trends of the loan portfolio, and a review of delinquent and classified loans. Actual losses could differ significantly from the amounts estimated by management.\nDividend payout ratio\nCash dividends paid on common shares, divided by net income.\nBasis points\nEach basis point is equal to one hundredth of one percent. Basis points are calculated by multiplying percentage points times 100. For example: 3.7 percentage points equals 370 basis points.\nInterest rate sensitivity\nThe relationship between interest sensitive earning assets and interest bearing liabilities.\nNet charge-offs\nThe amount of total loans charged off net of recoveries of loans that have been previously charged off.\nNet interest income\nTotal interest income less total interest expense.\nNet interest margin\nTaxable equivalent net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets.\nNet interest spread\nThe difference between the taxable equivalent yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing funds.\nOther real estate owned\nReal estate not used for banking purposes. For example, real estate acquired through foreclosure.\nProvision for loan losses\nThe charge against current income needed to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses.\nReturn on average assets (ROA)\nNet income (loss) divided by average total assets. Measures the relative profitability of the resources utilized by the Company.\nReturn on average equity (ROE)\nNet income (loss) divided by average shareholders' equity. Measures the relative profitability of the shareholders' investment in the Company.\nTax equivalent basis (TE)\nIncome from tax-exempt loans and investment securities has been increased by an amount equivalent to the taxes that would have been paid if this income were taxable at statutory rates. In order to provide comparisons of yields and margins for all earning assets, the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets is increased to make them fully equivalent to other taxable interest income investments.\nWeighted average number of common shares outstanding\nThe number of shares determined by relating (a) the portion of time within a reporting period that common shares have been outstanding to (b) the total time in that period.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following pages present management's discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Farmers Capital Bank Corporation (the Company\u201d or Parent Company\u201d), a bank holding company, and its bank and nonbank subsidiaries. Bank subsidiaries include Farmers Bank & Capital Trust Company ( Farmers Bank\u201d) in Frankfort, KY, United Bank & Trust Company ( United Bank\u201d) in Versailles, KY, First Citizens Bank ( First Citizens\u201d) in Elizabethtown, KY, and Citizens Bank of Northern Kentucky, Inc. ( Citizens Northern\u201d) in Newport, KY. All significant intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation.\nAt year-end 2015, Farmers Bank had two primary subsidiaries, which include EG Properties, Inc., and Farmers Capital Insurance Corporation ( Farmers Insurance\u201d). EG Properties, Inc. is involved in real estate management and liquidation for certain repossessed properties of Farmers Bank. Farmers Insurance is an insurance agency in Frankfort, KY. Leasing One Corporation, a company formed to lease commercial property, was dissolved effective at year-end 2015. United Bank has one direct subsidiary, EGT Properties, Inc. EGT Properties, Inc. is involved in real estate management and liquidation for certain repossessed properties of United Bank. First Citizens has one subsidiary, HBJ Properties, LLC. HBJ Properties, LLC is involved in real estate management and liquidation for certain repossessed properties of First Citizens. Citizens Northern has one direct subsidiary, ENKY Properties, Inc., which is involved in real estate management and liquidation for certain repossessed properties of Citizens Northern.\nThe Company had two active nonbank subsidiaries in 2015, FCB Services, Inc. ( FCB Services\u201d), and FFKT Insurance Services, Inc. ( FFKT Insurance\u201d). FCB Services is a data processing subsidiary located in Frankfort, KY that provides services to the Company's banks as well as unaffiliated entities. FFKT Insurance is a captive property and casualty insurance company insuring primarily deductible exposures and uncovered liability related to properties of the Company. EKT Properties, Inc., which was dissolved effective December 31, 2014, was formed to manage and liquidate certain real estate properties repossessed by the Company. At year-end 2015, the Company had three subsidiaries organized as Delaware statutory trusts that were not consolidated into its financial statements. These trusts were formed for the purpose of issuing trust preferred securities. In January 2016, the Company terminated one of the three trusts as a result of the early extinguishment of debt issued to the trust. For additional information, refer to Note 24 of the Company's 2015 audited consolidated financial statements.\nFor a complete list of the Company's subsidiaries, please refer to the discussion under the heading Organization\u201d included in Part 1, Item 1 of this Form 10-K. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related footnotes that follow.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis report contains forward-looking statements with the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act\u201d) and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act\u201d), under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that involve risks and uncertainties. Statements in this report that are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. In general, forward-looking statements relate to a discussion of future financial results or projections, future economic performance, future operational plans and objectives, and statements regarding the underlying assumptions of such statements. Although management of the Company believes that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements contained herein are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate, and therefore, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements included herein will prove to be accurate.\nVarious risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the Company's forward-looking statements. In addition to the risks described under Part 1, Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d in this report, factors that could cause actual results to differ from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: economic conditions (both generally and more specifically in the markets in which the Company and its subsidiaries operate) and lower interest margins; competition for the Company's customers from other providers of financial services; deposit outflows or reduced demand for financial services and loan products; government legislation, regulation, and changes in monetary and fiscal policies (which changes from time to time and over which the Company has no control); changes in interest rates; changes in prepayment speeds of loans or investment securities; inflation; material unforeseen changes in the liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of the Company's customers; changes in the level of non-performing assets and charge-offs; changes in the number of common shares outstanding; the capability of the Company to successfully enter into a definitive agreement for and close anticipated transactions; unexpected claims or litigation against the Company; expected insurance or other recoveries; technological or operational difficulties; the impact of new accounting pronouncements and changes in policies and practices that may be adopted by regulatory agencies; acts of war or terrorism; the ability of the Parent Company to receive dividends from its subsidiaries; the impact of larger or similar financial institutions encountering difficulties, which may adversely affect the banking industry or the Company; the Company or its subsidiary banks' ability to maintain required capital levels and adequate funding sources and liquidity; and other risks or uncertainties detailed in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of the Company.\nThe Company's forward-looking statements are based on information available at the time such statements are made. The Company expressly disclaims any intent or obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect changes in underlying assumptions or factors, new information, future events, or other changes.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies\nThe Company's audited consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and follow general practices applicable to the banking industry. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. These estimates, assumptions, and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements. Certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. Estimates, assumptions, and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value, when a decline in the value of an asset warrants an impairment write-down or valuation reserve to be established, or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event. Carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility between reporting periods. The fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by third-party sources, when available. When third-party information is not available, valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management primarily through the use of internal cash flow modeling techniques.\nThe most significant accounting policies followed by the Company are presented in Note 1 of the Company's 2015 audited consolidated financial statements. These policies, along with the disclosures presented in other financial statement notes and in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined. Based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods, assumptions, and estimates underlying those amounts, management has identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses and fair value measurements to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments, and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses represents credit losses specifically identified in the loan portfolio, as well as management's estimate of probable incurred credit losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. Determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience, and consideration of current economic trends and conditions, all of which may be susceptible to significant changes. The loan portfolio also represents the largest asset group on the consolidated balance sheets. Additional information related to the allowance for loan losses that describes the methodology and risk factors can be found under the captions Asset Quality\u201d and Nonperforming Assets\u201d in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, as well as Notes 1 and 4 of the Company's 2015 audited consolidated financial statements.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe carrying value of certain financial assets and liabilities of the Company is impacted by the application of fair value measurements, either directly or indirectly. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In certain cases, an asset or liability is measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis, such as investment securities classified as available for sale and money market mutual funds. In other cases, management must rely on estimates or judgments to determine if an asset or liability not measured at fair value warrants an impairment write-down or whether a valuation reserve should be established.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of a financial instrument using a variety of valuation methods. Where financial instruments are actively traded and have quoted market prices, quoted market prices are used for fair value. Active markets are those where transaction volumes are sufficient to provide objective pricing information with reasonably narrow bid/ask spreads and where quoted prices do not vary widely. When the financial instruments are not actively traded, other observable market inputs such as quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics may be used, if available, to determine fair value. Inactive markets are characterized by low transaction volumes, price quotations that vary substantially among market participants, or in which minimal information is released publicly.\nWhen observable market prices do not exist, the Company estimates fair value primarily by using cash flow and other financial modeling methods. The valuation methods may also consider factors such as liquidity and concentration concerns. Other factors such as model assumptions, market dislocations, and unexpected correlations can affect estimates of fair value. Changes in these underlying factors, assumptions, or estimates in any of these areas could materially impact the amount of revenue or loss recorded.\nAdditional information regarding fair value measurements can be found in Notes 1 and 19 of the Company's 2015 audited consolidated financial statements. The following is a summary of the Company's more significant assets that may be affected by fair value measurements, as well as a brief description of the current accounting practices and valuation methodologies employed by the Company:\nAvailable For Sale Investment Securities and Money Market Mutual Funds\nInvestment securities classified as available for sale and money market mutual funds are measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis. These instruments are valued primarily by independent third party pricing services under the market valuation approach that include, but are not limited to, the following inputs:\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Mutual funds and equity securities are priced utilizing real-time data feeds from active market exchanges for identical securities; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Government-sponsored agency debt securities, obligations of states and political subdivisions, mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds, and other similar investment securities are priced with available market information through processes using benchmark yields, matrix pricing, prepayment speeds, cash flows, live trading data, and market spreads sourced from new issues, dealer quotes, and trade prices, among others sources.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2015, all of the Company's available for sale investment securities and money market mutual funds were measured using observable market data.\nOther Real Estate Owned\nOther real estate owned ( OREO\u201d) includes properties acquired by the Company through, or in lieu of, actual loan foreclosures and initially carried at fair value less estimated costs to sell. Fair value is generally based on third party appraisals of the property that includes comparable sales data. The carrying value of each OREO property is updated at least annually and more frequently when market conditions significantly impact the value of the property. If the carrying amount exceeds fair value less estimated costs to sell, an impairment loss is recorded through expense. OREO is subsequently accounted for at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs to sell. At December 31, 2015, OREO was $21.8 million compared to $32.0 million at year-end 2014.\nImpaired Loans\nLoans are considered impaired when it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impaired loans are measured at the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, at the loan's observable market price, or at the fair value of the collateral based on recent appraisals if the loan is collateral dependent. If the value of an impaired loan is less than the unpaid balance, the difference is credited to the allowance for loan losses with a corresponding charge to provision for loan losses. Loan losses are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan is confirmed.\nAppraisals used in connection with valuing collateral-dependent loans may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Appraisers take absorption rates into consideration and adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process to identify differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Such adjustments consist mainly of estimated costs to sell that are not included in certain appraisals or to update appraised collateral values as a result of market declines of similar properties for which a newer appraisal is available. These adjustments can be significant. Impaired loans were $37.2 million and $44.0 million at year-end 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nEXECUTIVE LEVEL OVERVIEW\nThe Company offers a variety of financial products and services at its 34 banking locations in 21 communities throughout Central and Northern Kentucky. The Company has four separately chartered commercial banks that operate under a community banking philosophy. This philosophy focuses primarily on understanding the banking needs of those in our local and surrounding communities and providing them with competitively priced products and a high level of personalized service. The most significant products and services the Company offers include consumer and business lending, checking, savings, and other deposit accounts, automated teller machines, electronic bill payments, and providing trust services and other traditional banking products and services. The primary goals of the Company are to continually improve profitability and shareholder value, increase and maintain a strong capital position, provide excellent service to our customers through our community banking structure, and to provide a challenging and rewarding work environment for our employees.\nThe Company generates a significant amount of its revenue, cash flows, and net income from interest income and net interest income. The ability to properly manage net interest income under changing market environments is crucial to the success of the Company. Managing credit risk also has a significant influence on the operating results of the Company. While the overall economy has largely improved since the recessionary period between 2007 and 2009 ( Recession\u201d), the Company continues to face an elevated level of nonperforming assets that built up following the Recession. The Company has focused a significant amount of effort to reduce its nonperforming assets over the last several years which has led to a substantial decline of nearly 60% when compared with its peak of $135 million during 2010. Nonperforming assets are at the lowest level since the first quarter of 2009.\nAs a result of increased business development efforts, the loan portfolio of the Company grew during 2015, the first year-over-year increase since 2008. Although end of period loan balances increased in the comparison, the Company continues its commitment to strong credit underwriting standards, which has at times hindered the opportunity to increase loans. Soft loan demand in the early to middle part of 2015 resulted in a decrease in the average loan balance of $35.2 million or 3.6% compared to a year earlier. Strengthened credit underwriting standards put in place since the Recession have resulted in steady improvement in the overall credit quality of the loan portfolio and a decrease to the allowance for loan losses.\nThe economic and business environment outlook for 2016 overall is positive, although individual indicators are mixed. In 2016, the Company intends to build on its recent loan growth and continue to reduce nonperforming assets. To further increase profitability, the Company will focus on increasing productivity and lowering operating costs. Since redeeming the final portion of its preferred stock during 2015, the Company is now considering additional alternatives as to the best use of its capital going forward to build shareholder value. In January 2016, the Company announced a dividend of $0.07 per common share and the early extinguishment of $15 million of debt. These two events reflect the initiatives of prudent use of capital and increasing shareholder value. The early extinguishment of debt resulted in a $4.1 million or $.36 per common share gain.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe Company reported net income of $15.0 million for 2015 a decrease of $1.5 million or 8.9% compared to $16.5 million for 2014. On a per common share basis, net income was $1.95 and $1.94 for 2015 and 2014, respectively. Per common share net income was positively impacted by the Company's redemption of its outstanding preferred shares, which decreased preferred dividends by $1.5 million in the comparison. The preferred share redemptions took place in three separate transactions of 10,000 shares each beginning in the second quarter of 2014 and concluding in June 2015. Selected income statement amounts and related information is presented in the table below.\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td> (In thousands, except per share data)\nYears Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>61,236 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>64,352 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3,116 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,641 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,153 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,512 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52,595 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54,199 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,604 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for loan losses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,429 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,364 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>935 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest income after provision for loan losses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56,024 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58,563 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,539 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Noninterest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,211 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,273 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,062 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Noninterest expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57,950 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59,278 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,328 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income before income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,285 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,558 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,273 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,293 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,099 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(806 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,992 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,459 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,467 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less preferred stock dividends and discount accretion\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>395 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,927 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,532 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income available to common shareholders\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,597 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,532 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>65 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Basic and diluted net income per common share\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.95 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.94 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>.01 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average common shares outstanding - basic and diluted\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,494 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,483 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Return on average assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>.84 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>.92 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> (8) bp\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Return on average equity\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.61 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.30 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> (69) bp\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nbp - basis points.\nThe more significant components related to the Company's results of operations are included below.\nInterest Income\nInterest income results from interest earned on earning assets, which primarily includes loans and investment securities. Interest income is affected by volume (average balance), the composition of earning assets, and the related rates earned on those assets. Total interest income for 2015 was $61.2 million, a decrease of $3.1 million or 4.8% compared to $64.4 million for 2014. The decrease in interest income was driven by lower interest from loans of $2.0 million or 4.0%, which was negatively impacted primarily by a decline in the average balance and, to a lesser degree, a lower average rate earned. Interest income on investment securities decreased $1.2 million or 8.1%, driven by a lower average rate earned.\nThe decrease in the average balance of loans has been accelerated by early payoffs primarily in the earlier part of 2015. The early payoffs relate to several larger balance credits that were refinanced by competitors with terms below the Company's underwriting standards. In recent years, the Company has focused on strengthening its credit underwriting standards, which has improved the overall credit quality of the loan portfolio. When high quality loan demand is low, available funds are redirected to lower yielding investment securities or cash equivalents or used to manage liquidity. The average interest rates on loans decreased three basis points during 2015, which is reflective of the sluggish economy, competitive factors, and the Company's ongoing strategy to be more selective in pricing both its loans and deposits.\nThe overall interest rate environment at year-end 2015, as measured by the Treasury yield curve, remains at very low levels when compared with historical trends. The yield curve flattened in the year-over-year comparison, particularly when comparing the two and ten-year maturity periods. The yields on shorter-term maturity periods, particularly six-month and two-year, increased more significantly than the yields related to longer periods such as the ten and thirty-year maturities. The six-month and two-year maturities increased 37 and 36 basis points, respectively, while yields on the ten and thirty-year maturities increased 8 and 26 basis points, respectively. At year-end 2015, the short-term federal funds interest rate target range was between 0.25% and 0.50%, which was increased during December 2015 from a target of zero to 0.25%. The Federal Reserve Board ( Federal Reserve\u201d) has indicated that it will continue to assess progress toward its objective of maximum employment and two percent inflation when determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target rate. At December 31, 2015, the national and Kentucky unemployment rates were 5.0% and 5.3%, respectively. At year-end 2015, the national inflation rate was 0.7% based on the Consumer Price Index published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense results from incurring interest on interest bearing liabilities, which are made up of interest bearing deposits, federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and other borrowed funds. Interest expense is affected by volume, composition of interest bearing liabilities, and the related rates paid on those liabilities. Total interest expense was $8.6 million for 2015, a decrease of $1.5 million or 14.9% compared to $10.2 million for 2014. The decrease in interest expense is attributed primarily to lower interest on deposits of $1.3 million or 30.4%. Both rate declines and lower volume contributed to the decrease, with a significant amount of the decrease related to time deposits. The Company has continued to aggressively reprice higher-rate maturing time deposits downward to lower market rates or to allow them to mature without renewal. Interest expense on long-term borrowings decreased $216 thousand or 3.7%, primarily due to a lower average balance of Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB\u201d) borrowings.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income is the most significant component of the Company's operating earnings. Net interest income is the excess of the interest income earned on earning assets over the interest paid for funds to support those assets. The two most common metrics used to analyze net interest income are net interest spread and net interest margin. Net interest spread represents the difference between the taxable equivalent yields on earning assets and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities. Net interest margin represents the percentage of taxable equivalent net interest income to average earning assets. Net interest margin will exceed net interest spread because of the existence of noninterest bearing sources of funds, principally demand deposits and shareholders' equity, which are also available to fund earning assets.\nChanges in net interest income and margin result from the interaction between the volume and composition of earning assets, their related yields, and the associated cost and composition of the interest bearing liabilities. Accordingly, portfolio size, composition, and the related yields earned and the average rates paid have a significant impact on net interest spread and margin. The table following this discussion represents the major components of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities on a tax equivalent basis. To compare the tax-exempt asset yields to taxable yields, amounts in the table are adjusted to pretax equivalents based on the marginal corporate Federal tax rate of 35%.\nTax equivalent net interest income was $54.3 million for 2015, a decrease of $1.6 million or 2.8% compared to $55.8 million for 2014. Net interest margin was 3.29% for 2015, a decrease of eight basis points from 3.37% for the prior year. The decrease in net interest margin was driven by a seven basis point decline in net interest spread, which was 3.14% for 2015 compared to 3.21% for 2014.\nThe Company actively monitors and proactively manages the rate sensitive components of both its assets and liabilities in a continuously changing and difficult market environment. Competition in the Company's market areas continues to be intense, and market interest rates remain very low by historical measures. The Federal Reserve increased the short-term federal funds target rate by a quarter percent in December 2015, the first change to this rate since December 2008, and has indicated that it expects only gradual adjustments in its stance on monetary policy.\nSimilar to the short-term federal funds target rate, the prime interest rate rose a quarter percent in December 2015. The Company uses the prime interest rate as part of its pricing model primarily on variable rate commercial real estate loans. The prime interest rate can have a significant impact on the Company's interest income from loans that reprice based on changes to this rate. The Company's variable interest rate loans contain provisions that limit the amount of increase or decrease in the interest rate during the life of a loan. This will limit the increase or decrease in interest income on loans that have interest rates tied to the prime interest rate. For 2015, the average yield earned on loans was 5.17%, which exceeded the prime interest rate of 3.50% at year-end. Predicting the direction and timing of future interest rates is uncertain.\nFor 2015, the average rate of the Company's two most significant components of net interest income, loans and time deposits, both declined. The average rate earned on the Company's loan portfolio for 2015 declined three basis points to 5.17% and the average rate paid on time deposits decreased 16 basis points to 0.64% compared to 2014. The Company expects its net interest margin to remain relatively flat in the near term based on internal modeling using expectations about future market interest rates, loan volume, the maturity structure of the Company's earning assets and liabilities, and other factors. Future results, however, could be significantly different than expectations.\nDistribution of Assets, Liabilities and Shareholders' Equity: Interest Rates and Interest Differential\nTable 101: <table>

Company recorded a credit to the provision for loan losses in the amount of $3.4 million and $4.4 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of outstanding loans (net of unearned income) was 1.08% at December 31, 2015 compared to 1.50% at year-end 2014. The credit to the provision for loan losses is attributed to continued improvement in the credit quality of the loan portfolio. The decrease in the credit to the provision is mainly driven by growth of $27.3 million in the loan portfolio during 2015 compared to a decline of $67.9 million in loans outstanding during 2014. Further information about improvements in the Company's overall credit quality is included under the captions Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d and Nonperforming Loans\u201d that follows.\nNet charge-offs were $224 thousand and $2.2 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively, down $2.0 million or 90.0% in the comparison. Net charge-offs were 0.02% of average loans outstanding for 2015 compared to 0.23% for the prior year.\nNoninterest Income\nThe components of noninterest income are as follows for the periods indicated:\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\nYears Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service charges and fees on deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,590 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,801 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(211 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.7 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Allotment processing fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,321 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(693 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13.8 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other service charges, commissions, and fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,545 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,248 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>297 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Trust income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,373 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,568 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(195 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.6 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment securities gains (losses), net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>171 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(63 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>234 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sale of mortgage loans, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>824 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>490 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>334 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income from company-owned life insurance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>937 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,231 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(294 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(23.9 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>450 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>984 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(534 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(54.3 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total noninterest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,211 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,273 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,062 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.6 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNM - not meaningful.\nThe more significant items impacting noninterest income are included below.\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Service charges and fees on deposits decreased primarily due to lower overdraft fees of $351 thousand or 7.7%, reflecting a decrease in volume attributed in part to overall trends in consumer behavior.

The increase in benefits expenses was driven mainly by claims activity related to the Company's self-funded health insurance plan and an increase in the actuary-determined benefit expenses related to postretirement medical costs. Postretirement benefit expenses increased mainly due to changes in actuary assumptions used to value the plan liability and expense, primarily the assumption related to the discount rate.

The decrease in development, operating, and maintenance expenses were primarily related to increasing the marketability of two real estate construction projects to better position them for sale during the prior year. The two properties were subsequently sold.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense was $5.3 million for 2015, a decrease of $806 thousand or 13.2% compared to $6.1 million for 2014. The effective income tax rates were 26.1% and 27.0% for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in income tax expense and the effective tax rate for 2015 is attributed primarily to lower pretax income, which was driven by a higher mix of tax-exempt versus taxable sources of revenue. The effective income tax rates are lower than the U.S. statutory federal rate of 35% primarily as a result of tax-exempt interest income from loans and investment securities, income from life insurance policies, and premium income associated with the Company's captive insurance subsidiary.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nTotal assets of the Company were $1.8 billion at year-end 2015, down $6.7 million or 0.4% compared with year-end 2014. The Company's overall financial condition continued to improve in the current year. The loan portfolio grew $27.3 million or 2.9% to $959 million during 2015, the first year-over-year increase since 2008. Total nonperforming assets were $54.1 million at year-end. While still elevated, nonperforming assets have declined $80.5 million or 59.8% from their peak of $135 million in the first quarter of 2010. Although net interest margin fell eight basis points to 3.29%, loan quality metrics continued to improve throughout the year. Regulatory capital levels remain significantly above the well-capitalized\u201d threshold, even after the redemption of the final portion of the Company's preferred stock in the amount of $10.0 million during the year.\nTemporary Investments\nTemporary investments consist of interest bearing deposits in other banks, federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell, and money market mutual funds. The Company uses these funds in the management of liquidity and interest rate sensitivity or as a short-term holding prior to subsequent movement into other investments with higher yields or for other purposes. At December 31, 2015, temporary investments were $92.1 million, an increase of $18.0 million or 24.2% compared to $74.1 million at year-end 2014.\nInvestment Securities\nThe investment securities portfolio is comprised primarily of residential mortgage-backed securities, tax-exempt securities of states and political subdivisions, and debt securities issued by U.S. government-sponsored agencies. Substantially all of the Company's investment securities are designated as available for sale. Total investment securities had a carrying amount of $586 million at year-end 2015, a decrease of $44.3 million or 7.0% compared to $630 million at year-end 2014. Proceeds received from maturing or called investment securities not needed to fund higher-earning loans are either reinvested in similar investments or used to manage liquidity, such as for deposit outflows or other payment obligations. The Company periodically sells investment securities in response to its overall asset/liability management strategy to lock in gains, increase yield, restructure expected future cash flows, and/or enhance its capital position.\nThe decrease in investment securities was driven by net maturities, calls, and sales of $145 million in the aggregate, which outpaced purchases totaling $110 million. The remainder of the decrease was due to $5.6 million of net premium amortization and a $3.0 million decrease in the market value adjustment related to securities classified as available for sale. The decrease in the value of the available for sale securities portfolio is attributed to a general shift downward in bond prices during the fourth quarter, primarily for the two- and three-year maturity periods. In general, as market interest rates increase, the value of fixed rate investments decrease.\nAt year-end 2015, investment securities included $5.9 million amortized cost amounts of single-issuer trust preferred capital securities of a U.S. based global financial services firm with an estimated fair value of $5.1 million, down from $5.5 million at year-end 2014. The investment continues to perform according to contractual terms and is rated as investment grade by major rating agencies. The issuer of the securities announced in the first quarter of 2015 an increase in per share common dividend payments and authorization of a common equity repurchase plan. The Company does not intend to sell its investment in these securities, nor does the Company believe it is likely that it will be required to sell these securities prior to their anticipated recovery. The Company believes these securities are not impaired due to reasons of credit quality or other factors, but rather the unrealized loss is primarily attributed to continuing uncertainties in both international and domestic economies and market volatility. The Company believes that it will collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of these securities and that the fair values of these securities will recover as they approach their maturity dates.\nThe Company attributes the unrealized losses in other sectors of the investment securities portfolio to changes in market interest rates and volatility, and thus identifies them as temporary. As discussed further above, market interest rates generally increased throughout 2015. Investment securities with an unrealized loss at December 31, 2015 are performing according to their contractual terms, and the Company does not expect to incur a loss on these securities unless they are sold prior to maturity. The Company does not have the intent to sell these securities nor does it believe it is likely that it will be required to sell these securities prior to their anticipated recovery. The Company does not consider any of the securities to be impaired due to reasons of credit quality or other factors. All investment securities in the Company's portfolio are currently performing.\nFunds made available from sold, matured, or called bonds are redirected to fund higher yielding loan growth when available, reinvested to purchase additional investment securities, or otherwise employed to improve the composition of the balance sheet and liquidity. The purchase of nontaxable obligations of states and political subdivisions is one of the primary means of managing the Company's tax position. The impact of the alternative minimum tax related to the Company's ability to acquire tax-free obligations at an attractive yield is routinely monitored. The Company does not have direct exposure to the subprime mortgage market. The Company does not originate subprime mortgages nor has it invested in bonds that are secured by such mortgages.\nThe following table summarizes the carrying values of investment securities on December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013. The investment securities are divided into available for sale and held to maturity securities. Available for sale securities are carried at estimated fair value and held to maturity securities are carried at amortized cost.

The weighted average tax rates on exempt state and political subdivisions are computed based on the marginal corporate Federal tax rate of 35%.\nLoans\nLoans, net of unearned income, were $959 million at December 31, 2015, an increase of $27.3 million or 2.9% compared to year-end 2014. The loan portfolio grew during the last three quarters of 2015, with three larger-balance commercial real estate loans totaling $26.1 million in the aggregate driving the increase in the fourth quarter. The Company continues a measured and cautious approach to loan originations while working to further reduce its level of nonperforming assets as economic growth remains slow. Generating high quality loans continues to be a challenge, and the increase in outstanding loans occurred despite early payoffs of several larger balance credits. These early payoffs were primarily the result of several larger credits that were refinanced by competitors, many of which were with terms below the Company's underwriting standards. Loan payments include $4.5 million related to nonaccrual loans and $3.9 million related to performing restructured loans.\nFrom time to time the Company may purchase a limited amount of loans originated by otherwise nonaffiliated third parties. The Company performs its own risk assessment and makes the credit decision on each loan prior to purchase. The Company purchased smaller balance commercial loans totaling $8.3 million and $3.8 million in the aggregate during 2015 and 2014, respectively. The average amount of the purchased loans was $115 thousand for 2015 and $80 thousand for 2014.\nThe composition of the loan portfolio is summarized in the table that follows. Based on economic forecasts and other available information, the Company expects continued gradual improvements to the local and regional economy during the coming year. An improving economy, particularly where the labor force participation rates increase, could lead to continued growth in the loan portfolio.\nTable 121: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial, financial, and agricultural\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>89,820 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>85,028 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>92,827 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>87,440 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>93,807 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate mortgage - construction and land development\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>115,516 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>97,045 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>101,352 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>102,454 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>119,989 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate mortgage - residential\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>355,134 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>361,022 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>371,582 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>368,762 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>397,357 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate mortgage - farmland and other commercial enterprises\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>386,386 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>375,277 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>418,147 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>425,477 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>432,438 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Installment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,419 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,413 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,092 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,247 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,365 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lease financing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>158 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>883 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,615 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,152 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>959,275 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>931,943 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>999,883 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,004,995 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,072,108 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn an average basis, loans represented 56.6% of earning assets for 2015, a decrease of 183 basis points compared to 58.5% for 2014. As loan demand changes, available funds are reallocated between temporary investments or investment securities, which typically involve a decrease in credit risk and result in lower yields. The Company does not have direct exposure to the subprime mortgage market. The Company does not originate subprime mortgages nor has it invested in bonds that are secured by such mortgages. Subprime mortgage lending is defined by the Company generally as lending to a borrower that would not qualify for a mortgage loan at prevailing market rates or whereby the underwriting decision is based on limited or no documentation of the ability to repay.\nThe following table presents the amount of commercial, financial, and agricultural loans and loans secured by real estate outstanding at December 31, 2015 which, based on remaining scheduled repayments of principal, are due in the periods indicated.\nLoan Maturities\nTable 122: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Within One Year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> After One But Within Five Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> After Five Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial, financial, and agricultural\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,408 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41,084 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,328 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>89,820 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate mortgage - construction and land development\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,685 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45,061 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,770 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>115,516 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate mortgage - residential\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,232 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>83,048 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>250,854 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>355,134 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate mortgage - farmland and other commercial enterprises\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,275 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>170,236 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>185,875 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>386,386 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>106,600 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>339,429 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>500,827 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>946,856 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table below presents the amount of commercial, financial, and agricultural loans and loans secured by real estate outstanding at December 31, 2015 that are due after one year, classified according to sensitivity to changes in interest rates.\nInterest Sensitivity\nTable 123: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fixed\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Variable\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Rate\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Due after one but within five years\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>291,550 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47,879 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Due after five years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>136,036 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>364,791 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>427,586 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>412,670 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAsset Quality\nThe Company's loan portfolio is subject to varying degrees of credit risk. Credit risk is mitigated by diversification within the portfolio, limiting exposure to any single customer or industry, rigorous lending policies and underwriting criteria, and collateral requirements. The Company maintains policies and procedures to ensure that the granting of credit is done in a sound and consistent manner. This includes policies on a company-wide basis that require certain minimum standards to be maintained by its subsidiary banks. However, the policies also permit the subsidiary companies authority to adopt standards that are no less stringent than those included in the company-wide policies. Credit decisions are made at the subsidiary bank level under guidelines established by policy. The Company's internal audit department performs loan reviews at each subsidiary bank during the year. This review evaluates loan administration, credit quality, documentation, compliance with Company loan standards, and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a consolidated and subsidiary basis.\nThe provision for loan losses represents charges or credits made to earnings to maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level considered adequate to provide for probable incurred credit losses at the balance sheet date. The allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance increased by the provision for loan losses and decreased by net charge-offs. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance.\nThe allowance for loan losses and related provision for loan losses generally fluctuate relative to the level of nonperforming and impaired loans, but other factors impact the amount of the allowance. The Company estimates the adequacy of the allowance using a risk-rated methodology based on the Company's past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral securing loans, composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions, and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates that may be susceptible to change.\nThe allowance for loan losses consists of specific and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired. The general component covers non-impaired loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current risk factors. Allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans, but the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in management's judgment, should be charged off. Actual loan losses could differ significantly from the amounts estimated by management.\nThe Company's risk-rated methodology includes segregating non-impaired watch list and past due loans from the general portfolio and allocating a loss percentage to these loans depending on their status. For example, watch list loans, which may be identified by the internal loan review risk-rating process or by regulatory examiner classification, are assigned a certain loss percentage while loans past due 30 days or more are assigned a separate loss percentage. Each of these loss rates considers past experience as well as current factors. The remainder of the general loan portfolio is segregated into portfolio segments having similar risk characteristics identified as follows: real estate loans, commercial loans, and consumer loans. Each of these portfolio segments is assigned a loss percentage based on their respective sixteen quarter rolling historical loss rates, adjusted for qualitative risk factors.\nThe qualitative risk factors used in the methodology are consistent with the guidance in the most recent Interagency Policy Statement on the Allowance for Loan Losses issued. Each factor is supported by a detailed analysis performed at each subsidiary bank and is both measureable and supportable. Some factors include a minimum allocation in some instances where loss levels are extremely low and it is determined to be prudent from a safety and soundness perspective. Qualitative risk factors that are used in the methodology include the following for each loan portfolio segment:\nTable 124: <table> <tr> <td> \u25cfDelinquency trends\n</td> <td> \u25cfManagement experience risk\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u25cfTrends in net charge-offs\n</td> <td> \u25cfConcentration of credit risk\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u25cfTrends in loan volume\n</td> <td> \u25cfEconomic conditions risk\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u25cfLending philosophy risk\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nA loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Loans for which the terms have been modified resulting in a concession, and for which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties, are considered troubled debt restructurings and classified as impaired. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower's prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed.\nWhile the overall economy experienced further improvement in 2015, the Company continued its steady progress in reducing its level of nonperforming assets. The Recession resulted in an accumulation of nonperforming assets, and significant deterioration in the Company's credit quality and collateral values, primarily in residential real estate lending. Credit quality has improved significantly over the last few years, as loan underwriting standards have been strengthened and nonperforming asset levels have declined nearly 60% from the peak that occurred in 2010. Although overall economic growth remains slow, the key economic measures have largely recovered from the Recession. In Kentucky, housing starts continue to gradually increase and foreclosure rates are at the lowest rate since 2007. At year-end 2015, the national and Kentucky unemployment rate was 5.0% and 5.3%, respectively. Unemployment rates have improved significantly from a year ago, but labor force participation rates remain near 30-year lows.\nWith the continued improvement in the credit quality of the loan portfolio, the level of nonperforming assets are at the lowest level since the first quarter of 2009. Nonperforming loans were $32.2 million at year-end, a decrease of $3.7 million for the year and $75.7 million or 70.1% since peaking at $108 million in the first quarter of 2010. The Company includes accruing restructured loans as a component of its nonperforming loans. Such loans were $23.8 million at year-end 2015 and account for 74.0% of nonperforming loans. Of the $23.8 million in accruing restructured loans, $22.2 million consist of three larger-balance credit relationships secured by various types of real estate collateral. Nonaccrual loans were $8.4 million at year-end 2015, down $3.1 million or 27.2% for the year. Nonperforming assets as a percent of total assets fell eight basis points to 3.0%. High levels of nonperforming assets generally result in loan charge-offs, provisions for loan losses, and impairment charges on repossessed real estate. The Company works with its loan customers on an individual case-by-case basis in order to maximize loan repayments on its challenged credits and typically does not restructure those that are past due.\nImpaired loans are those in which the Company does not expect to receive full payment under the contractual terms. Impaired loans are measured at the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, at the loan's observable market price, or at the fair value of the collateral taking into consideration estimated costs to sell if the loan is collateral dependent. Collateral values are updated in accordance with policy guidelines by obtaining independent third party appraisals and monitoring sales activity of similar properties in our market area.\nAt year-end 2015, the Company had $2.9 million in specific reserves allocated to impaired loans. Of this total, $1.2 million or 41.1% is attributed to a group of loans to a single creditor totaling $7.3 million secured by a combination of a real estate development and residential real estate properties. This group of collateral dependent loans is classified as performing restructured loans at year-end 2015.\nThe Company recorded a credit to the provision for loan losses of $3.4 million in 2015, or $935 thousand lower than the $4.4 million recorded in 2014. The decreased credit is due to loan portfolio growth of $27.3 million or 2.9% during 2015 compared to a decline of $67.9 million or 6.8% during 2014. Historical loss rates, adjusted for current risk factors, have improved due to lower recent charge-off activity that has replaced higher levels that had been included in the early part of the Company's look-back period used in its allowance for loan losses methodology. The decrease in historical loss rates and charge-off activity is due primarily to stabilizing real estate values, which serves as collateral for nearly 90% of the Company's loan portfolio. The rapid declines in real estate values experienced beginning in 2008 and continuing through 2011 have leveled off significantly, and the allowance for loan losses reflects this improvement. The Company has also implemented stronger credit underwriting standards in recent years, which has improved overall credit quality measures.\nWhile historical loss rates may continue improving in the near term due to elevated charge-offs falling out of the look-back period, this improvement may not necessarily correlate to a lower provision for loan losses. Other qualitative factors, such as changes in loan volume, the overall makeup of the portfolio, economic conditions, and other risk factors applied to historical loss rates may offset to some degree the impact of decreases to the historical loss rates. Certain credit quality measures are summarized in the table that follows for the periods indicated. Several of these measures are at the best level in the last three years.\nTable 125: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Three-year\nHigh1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Three-year\nLow1\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Nonperforming loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,211 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,937 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50,537 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54,605 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,211 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Nonaccrual loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,380 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,508 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,828 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,994 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,201 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans past due 30-89 days and still accruing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>588 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,352 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,460 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,831 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>588 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans graded substandard or below\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44,220 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52,313 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75,688 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>87,973 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43,669 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impaired loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,182 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43,955 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58,339 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,182 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans, net of unearned income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>959,275 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>931,943 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>999,883 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,017,977 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>927,389 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n1Based on quarter-end balances over the previous three years.\nNet charge-offs were $224 thousand for 2015, a decrease of $2.0 million or 90.0% compared to 2014. Net charge-offs were 0.02% of average loans outstanding for 2015 compared to 0.23% for the prior year. Net charge-offs for the current and prior year are each well below the $14.2 million peak which occurred in the early part of the post-recession period of 2009. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of outstanding loans was 1.08% and 1.50% at year-end 2015 and 2014, respectively. As a percentage of nonperforming loans, the allowance for loan losses was 32.0% and 38.9% at year-end 2015 and 2014, respectively. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonaccrual loans was 123% and 121% at year-end 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nThe relatively low amount of the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans is due mainly to the makeup of nonperforming loans, where performing restructured loans represent 74.0% of total nonperforming loans outstanding at year-end 2015. The allowance attributed to credits that are restructured with lower interest rates generally represents the difference in the present value of future cash flows calculated at the loan's original effective interest rate and the new lower rate. This typically results in a reserve for loan losses that is less severe than for other loans that are collateral dependent. The allowance specifically allocated to impaired loans was $2.9 million or 7.9% of such loans at year-end 2015 compared with $3.4 million or 7.7% a year earlier.\nThe table below summarizes the loan loss experience for the past five years.\nAllowance For Loan Losses\nTable 126: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Years Ended December 31, (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance of allowance for loan losses at beginning of year\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,968 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,577 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,445 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,264 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,784 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans charged off:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial, financial, and agricultural\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,630 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>257 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>216 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,113 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate mortgage -

Nonperforming loans include nonaccrual loans, performing restructured loans, and loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest. Nonaccrual loans are considered to be an indicator of potential losses. The accrual of interest on loans is discontinued when it is determined that the collection of interest or principal is doubtful, or when a default of interest or principal has existed for 90 days or more, unless such loan is well secured and in the process of collection. Restructured loans occur when a lender, because of economic or legal reasons related to a borrower's financial difficulty, grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. Restructured loans typically include a reduction of the stated interest rate or an extension of the maturity date. The Company gives careful consideration to identifying which of its challenged credits merit a restructuring of terms that it believes will result in maximum loan repayments and mitigate possible losses. Cash flow projections are carefully scrutinized prior to restructuring any credits; past due credits are typically not granted concessions.\nNonperforming assets were $54.1 million at year-end 2015, a decrease of $13.9 million or 20.4% compared to $67.9 million at year-end 2014. Such assets have been reduced to the lowest level since peaking at $135 million in the first quarter of 2010. Nonperforming assets increased sharply during 2009 mainly as a result of prolonged weaknesses in the overall economy.\nNonperforming assets by category are presented in the table below for the dates indicated.\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans accounted for on nonaccrual basis\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,380 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,508 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,838 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,408 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>59,755 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>444 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>103 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restructured loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,831 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,429 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,255 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,349 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,125 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total nonperforming loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,211 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,937 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50,537 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53,860 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78,881 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other real estate owned\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,843 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,960 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,826 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52,562 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,157 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other foreclosed assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total nonperforming assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54,054 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>67,949 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>88,363 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>106,422 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>117,074 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ratio of total nonperforming loans to total loans (net of unearned income)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ratio of total nonperforming assets to total assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdditional details related to nonperforming loans were as follows at year-end 2015 and 2014:\nNonperforming Loans\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Nonaccrual Loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial, financial, and agriculture\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>52 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>88 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate mortgage -

From time to time the Company may modify a customer's loan, but such modifications may or may not meet the criteria for classification as a restructured troubled debt. Modifications that do not meet the criteria of a troubled debt include:\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> repricing a loan to a current market rate of interest to a borrower with good credit and adequate collateral value in order to retain the customer;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> changing the payment frequency from monthly to quarterly, semi-annually, or annually where the loan is performing, the borrower has good credit and adequate collateral value, and the Company believes valid reasons exist for the change; or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> extending the interest only payment period of a performing loan where the borrower has good credit and adequate collateral value in instances where a project may still be in a phase of development or leasing-up, and where the Company believes completion will occur in the near future, or such extension is otherwise in the Company's best interest.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs modifications are made, management evaluates whether the modification meets the criteria to be classified as a troubled debt. These criteria include two components:\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> 1.\n</td> <td> The bank makes a concession on the loan terms that it would not otherwise consider, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.\n</td> <td> The borrower is experiencing financial difficulty.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's loan policy provides guidance to its lending personnel regarding restructured loans to ensure those that are troubled debt are properly identified. Additional attention is given to restructured loans through the oversight of the Chief Credit Officer at the Parent Company to ensure that modifications meeting criteria for restructured loans are identified and properly reported.\nThe table below sets forth on an aggregate basis at December 31, 2015, the types of non-troubled debt restructurings by loan type, number of loans, average loan balance and modification type:\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> # of Loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\nLoan Type\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Average Loan Balance\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Range of Loan Balances\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\nModification Type\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td> Real estate mortgage - construction and land development\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>344 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$24 </td> <td>- </td> <td>$1,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> lowered interest rate to market rate to retain loan\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> Real estate mortgage - construction and land development\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>372 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>372 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> extended maturity due to delayed construction\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>123 </td> <td> </td> <td> Real estate mortgage - residential\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>135 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td>- </td> <td>2,153 </td> <td> </td> <td> lowered interest rate to market rate to retain loan\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> Real estate mortgage - residential\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> moved payment date from the beginning to the middle of the month\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>40 </td> <td> </td> <td> Real estate mortgage - farmland and other commercial enterprises\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>527 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>- </td> <td>4,139 </td> <td> </td> <td> lowered interest rate to market rate to retain loan\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td> Commercial\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>- </td> <td>77 </td> <td> </td> <td> lowered interest rate to market rate to retain loan\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td> Commercial\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44 </td> <td>- </td> <td>67 </td> <td> </td> <td> one consolidation of debt; one converted to amortizing payments\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td> Consumer\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>- </td> <td>195 </td> <td> </td> <td> lowered interest rate to market rate to retain loan\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> Consumer\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> changed amortization period\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn each of the modifications identified in the table above, management determined the loan was not in troubled condition due to the financial condition of the borrower and related collateral.\nThe Company has not engaged in loan splitting. Loan splitting is a practice that may occur in work-out situations whereby a loan is divided into two parts - a performing part and a nonperforming part. This benefits a lender by potentially replacing one impaired loan by one smaller good loan and one smaller bad loan. Overall charge-offs and reserve amounts are potentially reduced and the effects of adverse loan classifications may be diminished.\nThe Company's comprehensive risk-grading and loan review program includes a review of loans to assess risk and assign a grade to those loans, a review of delinquencies, and an assessment of loans for needed charge-offs or placement on nonaccrual status. The Company had loans in the amount of $54.2 million and $64.7 million at year-end 2015 and year-end 2014, respectively, which were performing but considered potential problem loans and are not included in the nonperforming loan totals in the tables above. These loans, however, are considered in establishing an appropriate allowance for loan losses. The balance outstanding for potential problem credits is mainly a result of lingering weaknesses in the overall economy that continue to strain some of the Company's customers. Potential problem loans include a variety of borrowers and are secured primarily by various types of real estate including commercial, construction properties, and residential real estate developments. The $10.5 million or 16.2% decrease during the year in the level of potential problem loans is attributed primarily to an overall improvement in credit quality similar to that of the overall portfolio. At December 31, 2015, the five largest potential problem credits were $12.3 million in the aggregate compared to $13.9 million at year-end 2014.\nPotential problem loans are identified on the Company's watch list and consist of loans that require close monitoring by management. Credits may be considered as a potential problem loan for reasons that are temporary or correctable, such as for a deficiency in loan documentation or absence of current financial statements of the borrower. Potential problem loans may also include credits where adverse circumstances are identified that may affect the borrower's ability to comply with the contractual terms of the loan. Other factors which might indicate the existence of a potential problem loan include the delinquency of a scheduled loan payment, deterioration in a borrower's financial condition identified in a review of periodic financial statements, a decrease in the value of the collateral securing the loan, or a change in the economic environment in which the borrower operates. Certain loans on the Company's watch list are also considered impaired and specific allowances related to these loans are established in accordance with the appropriate accounting guidance.\nOther real estate owned includes real estate properties acquired by the Company through, or in lieu of, actual loan foreclosures. At year-end 2015, OREO was $21.8 million, a decrease of $10.1 million or 31.7% compared to $32.0 million at year-end 2014. OREO has declined $30.7 million or 58.4% from its peak of $52.6 million, which occurred at year-end 2012.\nOREO activity for 2015 was as follows:\nTable 137: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance at December 31, 2014\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,960 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transfers from loans and other increases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,514 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Proceeds from sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10,342 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on sales, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(188 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Write downs and other decreases, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,101 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance at December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,843 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe reduction in OREO was driven by property sales and impairment charges of $10.5 million and $1.1 million, respectively, which more than offset new acquisitions. Six larger-balance properties with a carrying value of $6.7 million in the aggregate were sold during 2015. This includes three larger-balance residential real estate development properties that sold for $3.5 million in total with a net loss of $75 thousand, and three larger-balance commercial real estate properties sold for $3.1 million in total with a net loss of $123 thousand. The Company's had two OREO properties at year-end 2015 with a carrying amount in excess of $2.0 million each: one commercial real estate property of $2.6 million, and one commercial rental real estate property of $2.6 million.\nDeposits\nThe Company's primary source of funding for its lending and investment activities results from its customer deposits, which consist of noninterest and interest bearing demand, savings, and time deposits. A summary of the Company's deposits is presented in the table that follows. The decrease in time deposits is a result of the Company's high liquidity position and from its strategy to lower overall funding costs, mainly by allowing higher-rate certificates of deposit to roll off or reprice at significantly lower interest rates. Many of those balances have been moved into interest or noninterest bearing demand accounts or savings accounts by the customer. As rates have decreased throughout the deposit portfolio, many customers have opted to transfer funds from maturing time deposits or investments from other sources into short-term demand or savings accounts. The Company has not sought out or accepted brokered deposits in the past nor does it have plans to do so in the future.\nA summary of the Company's deposits is as follows for the dates

borrowings include funding sources with an original maturity of one year or less. The Company's short-term borrowings consist of federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, which are generally on an overnight basis. Short-term borrowings primarily represent funds that have been swept out of the deposit accounts of certain qualifying commercial customers into repurchase agreements and accounted for as secured borrowings. A summary of short-term borrowings is as follows:\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amount outstanding at year-end\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34,353 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,590 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,123 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Maximum month-end balance during the year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,474 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,568 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,885 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average outstanding\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,580 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,428 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,440 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average rate during the year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>.16 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>.18 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>.25 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average rate at year-end\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>.24 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>.16 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>.25 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLong-term Borrowings\nLong-term borrowings include funding sources with an original maturity greater than one year. The Company's long-term borrowings are comprised of securities sold under agreements to repurchase, FHLB advances, and subordinated notes payable to unconsolidated trusts. Long-term securities sold under agreements to repurchase primarily represent obligations related to the Company's balance sheet leverage transaction that originated in 2007. In this transaction, the Company borrowed $200 million through multiple fixed rate repurchase agreements and used the proceeds to purchase fixed rate Government National Mortgage Association ( GNMA\u201d) bonds that are pledged as collateral. The Company is required to secure the borrowed funds with GNMA bonds valued at 106% of the outstanding principal balance of the borrowings. Principal payments have reduced the outstanding balance of the obligation to $100 million at year-end 2015, with a weighted average interest rate of 3.95%. These borrowings are callable quarterly and mature in November 2017.\nThe Company has $1.5 million of other long-term repurchase agreements outstanding at year-end 2015 made in the ordinary course of business with commercial customers. These borrowings have a weighted average fixed rate of 0.88% with portions maturing in each subsequent year through 2019.\nFHLB advances to the Company's subsidiary banks are secured by restricted holdings of FHLB stock which participating banks are required to own as well as certain mortgage loans as required by the FHLB. FHLB advances are made pursuant to several different credit programs, which have their own interest rates and range of maturities. Interest rates on FHLB advances are fixed and range between 2.99% and 5.81%, with a weighted average rate of 3.98%. Remaining maturities of FHLB advances extend over multiple time periods through 2020, with a weighted average remaining term of 1.8 years. FHLB advances are generally used to increase the Company's lending activities and to aid the efforts of asset and liability management by utilizing various repayment options offered by the FHLB. Long-term advances from the FHLB totaled $18.8 million and $19.0 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. This represents a decrease of $155 thousand or 0.8% and is attributed to scheduled repayment activity. The Company has not initiated any long-term FHLB borrowings since 2008.\nIn 2005 and 2007, the Company completed a total of three private offerings of trust preferred securities through separate Delaware statutory trusts (the Trusts\u201d) sponsored by the Company in the aggregate amount of $47.5 million. The combined $25.0 million proceeds from the first two trusts ( Trusts I and II\u201d) established in 2005 were used to fund the acquisition of Citizens Bancorp. Proceeds from the third trust ( Trust III\u201d) were used primarily to acquire Company shares through a tender offer during 2007. The Company owns all of the common securities of each of the three Trusts. Subsequent to year-end 2015, the Company terminated Trust II as a result of the early extinguishment of debt issued to the trust. Refer to Note 24 of the Company's 2015 audited consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nThe Trusts used the proceeds from the sale of preferred securities, plus capital of $1.5 million contributed by the Company to establish the trusts, to purchase the Company's subordinated notes in amounts and bearing terms that parallel the amounts and terms of the respective preferred securities. Amounts and general terms related to the Trusts at year-end 2015 are summarized in the table below.\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> Trust I\n</td> <td> Trust II\n</td> <td> Trust III\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subordinated notes payable\n</td> <td> $10,310\n</td> <td> $15,464\n</td> <td> $23,196\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest rate terms\n</td> <td> 3-month LIBOR +150 BP\n</td> <td> 3-month LIBOR +165 BP\n</td> <td> 3-month LIBOR +132 BP\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest rate in effect at year-end\n</td> <td> 2.10%\n</td> <td> 2.26%\n</td> <td> 1.65%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stated maturity date\n</td> <td> September 30, 2035\n</td> <td> September 30, 2035\n</td> <td> November 1, 2037\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe subordinated notes of the Trusts are redeemable in whole or in part, without penalty, at the Company's option and are junior in right of payment of all present and future senior indebtedness of the Company. The weighted average interest rate in effect as of the last determination date in 2015 and 2014 was 1.94% and 1.71%, respectively.\nContractual Obligations\nThe Company's contractual obligations to make future payments as of December 31, 2015 are as follows:\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nContractual Obligations (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> One Year or Less\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> One to Three\nYears\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Three to Five\nYears\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> More Than Five\nYears\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Time deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>325,378 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>206,083 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>98,921 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,551 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,823 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term FHLB debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,806 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>806 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subordinated notes payable\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,970 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,970 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term securities sold under agreements to repurchase\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>101,474 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>716 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100,505 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>253 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unfunded postretirement benefit obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,085 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>410 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>931 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,079 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,665 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,995 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>361 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>423 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>252 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>959 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Employment agreements\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,935 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,249 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,616 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,070 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>506,643 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>208,819 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>220,396 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,011 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>57,417 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLong-term FHLB debt represents FHLB advances pursuant to several different credit programs. Long-term FHLB debt, subordinated notes payable, and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are more fully described under the caption Long-term Borrowings\u201d above and in Note 9 of the Company's 2015 audited consolidated financial statements. Payments for borrowings in the table above do not include interest. Postretirement benefit obligations are determined by actuaries and estimated based on various assumptions with payouts projected over the next ten years. Estimates can vary significantly each year due to changes in significant assumptions. Operating leases include standard business equipment used in the Company's day-to-day business as well as the lease of certain branch sites. Operating lease terms generally range from one to five years, with the ability to extend certain branch site leases at the Company's option. Payments related to leases are based on actual payments specified in the contracts. Employment agreements represent annual minimum base salary amounts payable by the Company to six employees. The Company has employment agreements with its Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and three key officers of its subsidiaries.\nGuarantees\nDuring 2007, the Parent Company entered into a guarantee agreement whereby it agreed to become unconditionally and irrevocably the guarantor of the obligations of three of its subsidiary banks in connection with the $200 million balance sheet leverage transaction. Principal payments by the bank subsidiaries have reduced the outstanding balance of the obligation to $100 million at year-end 2015, which matures in 2017. The borrowings are required to be secured by GNMA bonds valued at 106% of the amount outstanding, although the banks typically maintain an amount in excess of the required minimum. Should any of the subsidiary banks default on its borrowings under the agreement, the GNMA bonds securing the borrowings would be liquidated to satisfy amounts due. If the value of the GNMA bonds fall below the obligation under the contract, the Parent Company is obligated to cover any such shortfall in absence of the subsidiary banks' ability to do so. The Parent Company believes its subsidiary banks are fully capable of fulfilling their obligations under the borrowing arrangement and that the Parent Company will not be required to make any payments under the guarantee agreement.\nEffects of Inflation\nThe majority of the Company's assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. Therefore, the Company differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in nonmonetary assets, such as fixed assets and inventories. However, inflation does have an important impact on the growth of assets in the banking industry and on the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio. Inflation also affects other noninterest expense, which tends to rise during periods of general inflation.\nMarket Risk Management\nMarket risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates. The Company's market risk is comprised primarily of interest rate risk created by its core banking activities of extending loans and receiving deposits. The Company's success is largely dependent upon its ability to manage this risk. Interest rate risk is defined as the exposure of the Company's net interest income to adverse movements in interest rates. Although the Company manages other risks, such as credit and liquidity risk, management considers interest rate risk to be its most significant risk, which could potentially have the largest and a material effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. A sudden and substantial change in interest rates may adversely impact the Company's earnings to the extent that the interest rates earned on assets and paid on liabilities do not change at the same speed, to the same extent, or on the same basis. Other events that could have an adverse impact on the Company's performance include changes in general economic and financial conditions, general movements in market interest rates, and changes in consumer preferences. The Company's primary purpose in managing interest rate risk is to effectively invest the Company's capital and to manage and preserve the value created by its core banking business.\nManagement believes the most significant impact on financial and operating results is the Company's ability to react to changes in interest rates. Management seeks to maintain an essentially balanced position between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against the effects of wide interest rate fluctuations.\nThe Parent Company and each of its subsidiary banks has a Corporate Asset and Liability Management Committee ( ALCO\u201d) which monitors the composition of the balance sheet to ensure comprehensive management of interest rate risk and liquidity. The Parent Company ALCO also provides guidance and support to each ALCO of the Company's subsidiary banks and is responsible for monitoring risks on a company-wide basis. The Parent Company ALCO has established minimum standards in its asset and liability management policy that each subsidiary bank must adopt. However, the subsidiary banks are permitted to deviate from these standards so long as the deviation is no less stringent than that of the Corporate policy.\nThe Company uses a simulation model as a tool to monitor and evaluate interest rate risk exposure. The model is designed to measure the sensitivity of net interest income and net income to changing interest rates over future periods. Forecasting net interest income and its sensitivity to changes in interest rates requires the Company to make assumptions about the volume and characteristics of many attributes, including assumptions relating to the replacement of maturing earning assets and liabilities. Other assumptions include, but are not limited to, projected prepayments, projected new volume, and the predicted relationship between changes in market interest rates and changes in customer account balances. These effects are combined with the Company's estimate of the most likely rate environment to produce a forecast for the next twelve months. The forecasted results are then compared to the effect of a gradual 200 basis point increase and decrease in market interest rates on the Company's net interest income and net income. Because assumptions are inherently uncertain, the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income and net income or the effect of interest rate changes on net interest income and net income. Actual results could differ significantly from simulated results.\nAt December 31, 2015, the model indicated that if rates were to gradually increase by 200 basis points over the next twelve months, then net interest income (TE) and net income would decrease 0.33% and 0.96%, respectively, compared to forecasted results. The model indicated that if rates were to gradually decrease by 200 basis points over the next twelve months, then net interest income (TE) and net income would decrease 1.91% and 5.81%, respectively, compared to forecasted results.\nIn the current low interest rate environment, it is not practical or possible to reduce certain deposit rates by the same magnitude as rates on earning assets. The average rate paid on the Company's deposits is already below 2%. This situation magnifies the model's predicted results when modeling a decrease in interest rates, as earning assets with higher yields have more of an opportunity to reprice at lower rates than lower-rate deposits.\nLIQUIDITY\nLiquidity measures the ability to meet current and future cash flow needs as they become due. For financial institutions, liquidity reflects the capacity to meet loan demand, accommodate possible outflows in deposits, and to react and capitalize on interest rate market opportunities. A financial institution's ability to meet its current financial obligations is dependent upon the structure of its balance sheet, its ability to liquidate assets, and its access to alternative sources of funds. The Company's goal is to meet its near-term funding needs by maintaining a level of liquid funds through its asset/liability management. For the longer term, the liquidity position is managed by balancing the maturity structure of the balance sheet. This process allows for an orderly flow of funds over an extended period of time. The Company's ALCOs, both at the bank subsidiary and consolidated level, meet regularly and monitor the composition of the balance sheet to ensure comprehensive management of interest rate risk and liquidity.\nThe Company's objective as it relates to liquidity is to ensure that its subsidiary banks have funds available to meet deposit withdrawals and credit demands without unduly penalizing profitability. In order to maintain a proper level of liquidity, the subsidiary banks have several sources of funds available on a daily basis. For assets, those sources of funds include liquid assets that are readily marketable or that can be pledged, or which mature in the near future. These assets primarily include cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, investment securities, and cash flow generated by the repayment of principal and interest on loans and investment securities. For liabilities, sources of funds primarily include the subsidiary banks' core deposits, FHLB and other borrowings, and federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and investment securities are generally a predictable source of funds, deposit outflows and mortgage prepayments are influenced significantly by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition in our local markets.\nThe Company uses a liquidity ratio metric to help measure its ability to meet its cash flow needs. This ratio is monitored by ALCO at both the bank and consolidated level. The liquidity ratio is based on current and projected levels of sources and uses of funds. This measure is useful in analyzing cash needs and formulating strategies to achieve desired results. For example, a low liquidity ratio could indicate that the Company's ability to fund loans might become more difficult. A high liquidity ratio could indicate that the Company may have a disproportionate amount of funds in low yielding assets, which is more likely to occur during periods of sluggish loan demand or economic difficulties. The Company's liquidity position, as measured by its liquidity ratio, decreased at year-end 2015 when compared to year-end 2014, but is within its ALCO guidelines. The Company's liquidity ratio remains elevated mainly as a result of its overall net funding position and weak, quality loan demand. The Company continues a cautious lending strategy while continuing efforts to reduce its level of nonperforming assets in a slow growing economic environment.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company had $236 million of additional borrowing capacity under various FHLB, federal funds, and other agreements. However, there is no guarantee that these sources of funds will continue to be available to the Company, or that current borrowings can be refinanced upon maturity, although the Company is not aware of any events or uncertainties that are likely to cause a decrease in the Company's liquidity from these sources.\nLiquidity at the Parent Company level is primarily affected by the receipt of dividends from its subsidiary banks, cash balances maintained, and borrowings from nonaffiliated sources. Payment of dividends by the Company's subsidiary banks is subject to certain regulatory restrictions as set forth in national and state banking laws and regulations. Capital ratios at all four of the Company's subsidiary banks exceed regulatory established well-capitalized\u201d status at December 31, 2015 under the prompt corrective action regulatory framework.\nThe Parent Company's primary uses of cash include the payment of dividends to its preferred and common shareholders, injecting capital into subsidiaries, paying interest expense on borrowings, and payments for general operating expenses. The Company redeemed 20,000 shares, or two-thirds, of its original amount of outstanding preferred stock during 2014 in two separate partial redemptions of 10,000 shares each and redeemed the remaining 10,000 shares of preferred stock during the second quarter of 2015.\nThe Parent Company had cash balances of $36.0 million at year-end 2015, an increase of $3.9 million or 12.1% compared to $32.1 million at year-end 2014. Significant cash receipts of the Parent Company for 2015 include dividend payments from its bank subsidiaries of $14.4 million, a return of capital from nonbank subsidiaries in the amount of $1.4 million, and management fees from subsidiaries of $2.5 million. Significant cash payments by the Parent Company in 2015 include $10.0 million to redeem the final portion of its outstanding preferred stock, $3.0 million for salaries, payroll taxes, and employee benefits, $862 thousand for interest on trust preferred borrowings, and $508 thousand for the payment of dividends on its previously outstanding preferred stock.\nLiquid assets consist of cash and cash equivalents and available for sale investment securities. At December 31, 2015, consolidated liquid assets were $703 million, a decrease of $24.6 million or 3.4% from year-end 2014. The decrease in liquid assets was driven by lower available for sale investment securities of $44.2 million or 7.1%, offset by higher money market mutual funds of $11.0 million and higher interest bearing deposits with other banks in the amount of $7.6 million or 11.3%. Although liquid assets decreased in the comparison, liquid assets remain elevated mainly as a result of the Company's overall net funding position and weak, high-quality loan demand. The overall funding position of the Company changes as loan demand, deposit levels, and other sources and uses of funds fluctuate.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $25.9 million and $29.0 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively. This represents a decrease of $3.1 million or 10.6%, led by a decrease in net mortgage loans sold and a lower net loss on the sale and write downs of OREO. Net cash flow from investing activities was $15.9 million for 2015 and $57.3 million for 2014. This represents a decrease of $41.4 million or 72.3%, driven by loan activity, partially offset by net investment securities. For loans, the Company had net cash outflow representing overall principal advances of $28.2 million in 2015 compared to net principal collections of $56.7 million for 2014. For investment securities, the Company had net cash inflows of $35.8 million for 2015 compared with net cash outflows of $7.0 million for the prior year. Net cash inflows related to investments represent net sale, maturity, and call activity, where proceeds received from the sale, maturity, and calls exceed purchase of investment securities. For 2015, excess cash flows from investment activity were used more to fund new loans, deposit runoff, and the redemption of the final portion of the Company's preferred stock. In 2014, cash inflows were used to fund deposit runoff, debt repayments, and the redemption of a portion of the Company's preferred stock.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $22.2 million for 2015, a decrease of $31.4 million or 58.5% from $53.6 million for 2014. The decrease was driven by preferred stock redemptions, long-term and short-term borrowing activity, and deposit activity. The Company redeemed $10.0 million of its preferred stock outstanding in 2015 and $20.0 million in 2014. The company had net proceeds on long and short-term borrowings of $556 thousand and $5.8 million, respectively, for the current year compared to net repayments of $8.2 million and $533 thousand, respectively, for 2014. Net outflows related to deposits were $18.2 million for 2015, a decrease of $4.9 million compared to $23.1 million for 2014.\nInformation relating to commitments to extend credit is disclosed in Note 15 of the Company's 2015 audited consolidated financial statements. These transactions are entered into in the ordinary course of providing traditional banking services and are considered in managing the Company's liquidity position. The Company does not expect these commitments to significantly affect the liquidity position in future periods. The Company has not entered into any contracts for financial derivative instruments such as futures, swaps, options, or similar instruments.\nCAPITAL RESOURCES\nShareholders' equity was $176 million at year-end 2015, an increase of $2.8 million or 1.6% compared to $173 million at year-end 2014. Net income for the period increased shareholders' equity by $15.0 million, partially offset by the redemption of the remaining portion of the Company's preferred stock in the amount of $10.0 million during the second quarter, and a $2.0 million after-tax decrease in the unrealized gain on available for sale investment securities. The decrease in the unrealized gain on available for sale investment securities is attributed to an increase in market interest rates. Generally, as market interest rates rise, the value of fixed rate investments such as those held by the Company, decreases.\nOn January 9, 2009, the Company issued 30,000 shares of Series A, no par value cumulative perpetual preferred stock. The Company redeemed 20,000 of the preferred shares during 2014. On June 8, 2015, the Company redeemed the final 10,000 shares at the stated liquidation value of $1,000 per share, plus accrued dividends of $58 thousand. There was no additional debt or equity issued by the Company in connection with any of the shares redeemed.\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company's tangible capital ratio was 9.89% and 9.68%, respectively. The tangible capital ratio is defined as tangible equity as a percentage of tangible assets. Tangible common equity to tangible assets, which further excludes outstanding preferred stock, was 9.89% at year-end 2015, up 77 basis points compared to 9.12% at year-end 2014.\nConsistent with the objective of operating a sound financial organization, the Company's goal is to maintain capital ratios well above the regulatory minimum requirements. The Company's capital ratios as of December 31, 2015 and the regulatory minimums were as follows:\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Farmers Capital\nBank Corporation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Regulatory\nMinimum\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-based Capital1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.91 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.50 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tier 1 Risk-based Capital1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.00 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Risk-based Capital1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.89 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.00 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tier 1 Leverage Capital2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.46 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.00 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n1Common Equity Tier 1 ( CET1\u201d) Risk-based, Tier 1 Risk-based, and Total Risk-based Capital ratios are computed by dividing Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1, or Total Capital, as defined by regulation, by a risk-weighted sum of the assets, with the risk weighting determined by general standards established by regulation. The safest assets (e.g., government obligations) are assigned a weighting of 0% with riskier assets receiving higher ratings (e.g., ordinary commercial loans are assigned a weighting of 100%).\n2Tier 1 Leverage ratio is computed by dividing Tier 1 Capital by total quarterly average assets, as defined by regulation.\nIn July 2013, banking regulators issued final rules to bring U.S. banking organizations into compliance with the Basel III capital framework effective in 2015. The Company remains well-capitalized under the new rules, including meeting the effective minimum capital ratios with a fully phased-in capital conservation buffer.

These five categories are: (1) well-capitalized, (2) adequately capitalized, (3) undercapitalized, (4) significantly undercapitalized, and (5) critically undercapitalized. To be well-capitalized, a bank must have a CET1 Risk-based Capital ratio of at least 6.5%, a Tier 1 Risk-based Capital ratio of 8%, a Total Risk-based Capital ratio of at least 10%, and a Tier 1 Leverage ratio of at least 5%. As of December 31, 2015, each of the Company's four subsidiary banks had the following capital ratios for regulatory purposes:\nTable 146: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-based Capital Ratio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Tier 1 Risk-based Capital Ratio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total Risk-based Capital Ratio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Tier 1 Leverage Capital Ratio\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Farmers Bank\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.57 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.57 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.35 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.20 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> United Bank\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.67 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.67 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.68 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.89 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> First Citizens\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.55 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.55 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.17 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.20 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Citizens Northern\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.42 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.42 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.67 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.79 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnited Bank. During January 2014, United Bank entered into a Memorandum of Understanding ( Memorandum\u201d) with the FDIC and Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions ( KDFI\u201d), which replaced regulatory agreements dating back to November 2009 primarily relating to the bank's level of nonperforming assets. This Memorandum was terminated in March 2015. In connection with the termination of the Memorandum, the Board of Directors of United Bank agreed to adopt a resolution which included many of the same provisions as the Memorandum, including the requirement to seek approval from the FDIC and KDFI prior to the payment of dividends to the Parent Company. United Bank has both complied with and satisfied the terms of the resolution. As of January 2016, all regulatory agreements and board resolutions between the FDIC, KDFI, and United Bank have been terminated.\nCitizens Northern. The FDIC and KDFI entered into a Memorandum with Citizens Northern in September 2010. This Memorandum was terminated and replaced in July 2013. The updated Memorandum included provisions that required the bank to maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio at or above 9.0% and to obtain regulatory approval before declaring or paying a dividend to the Parent Company. The Memorandum was terminated in August 2015 following a joint examination by the FDIC and KDFI, which found satisfactory compliance with the terms of the Memorandum and overall improvement in financial condition.\nShare Buy Back Program\nAt various times, the Company's Board of Directors has authorized the purchase of shares of the Company's outstanding common stock. No stated expiration dates have been established under any of the previous authorizations. There are 84,971 shares that may still be purchased under the various authorizations, though no shares have been purchased since 2008.\nShareholder Information\nAs of February 4, 2016, the Company had 2,804 shareholders of record, which includes individual participants in securities positions listings.\nCommon Stock Price\nThe Company's common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC exchange in the Global Select Market tier, with sales prices reported under the symbol: FFKT.

There were no dividends declared on the Company's common stock in 2015 or 2014.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nSee Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d under the caption Recently Issued But Not Yet Effective Accounting Standards,\u201d in the Company's 2015 audited consolidated financial statements for further information about recently issued accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on the Company's financial statements.\n2014 Compared to 2013\nThe Company reported net income of $16.5 million or $1.94 per common share in 2014 compared to $13.4 million or $1.54 per common share for 2013. This represents an increase of $3.0 million or $.40 per common share. The increase in net income is primarily attributed to a decrease in the provision for loan losses of $1.8 million, an increase in noninterest income of $1.2 million or 5.2%, and lower net interest income and noninterest expenses of $539 thousand or 1.0% and $2.3 million or 3.7%, respectively. Income tax expense increased $1.7 million or 37.5%.\nFor 2014, the decrease in net interest income from 2013 was driven by lower interest income of $2.4 million or 3.6%, which more than offset a reduction in interest expense of $1.8 million or 15.4%. Interest income on loans decreased $3.6 million or 6.7%, partially offset by an increase in interest from investment securities of $1.2 million or 9.2%. Interest expense on deposits decreased $1.7 million or 28.2%. Interest income on loans was negatively impacted by both volume declines and a lower average rate earned. The increase in interest income on investment securities was driven by higher volume. Interest expense on deposits decreased primarily due to the repricing of higher-rate time deposits to lower market interest rates and a lower average balance outstanding. Net interest margin was 3.37% for 2014, down three basis points from 3.40% for 2013. Net interest spread was 3.21%, down two basis points compared to 3.23%.\nThe Company recorded a credit to the provision for loan losses in the amount of $4.4 million and $2.6 million for 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increased credit was due to continued overall improvement in the credit quality of the loan portfolio combined with a $67.9 million or 6.8% decline in loans outstanding. Nonperforming loans, impaired loans, early stage delinquencies, and watch list loans all improved during 2014. Historical loss rates, adjusted for current risk factors, also improved as lower charge-off activity replaced the higher levels that spiked upward starting in 2009.\nNonperforming loans decreased $14.6 million or 28.9% in 2014. The allowance for loan losses was $14.0 million at year-end 2014 and $20.6 million at year-end 2013. As a percentage of loans net of unearned income, the allowance for loan losses decreased 56 basis points to 1.50% at year-end 2014 compared to 2.06% a year earlier.\nNoninterest income for 2014 was $23.3 million, an increase of $1.2 million or 5.2% compared to $22.1 million for 2013. The increase was driven mainly by income related to the Company's equity interest in its three tax credit partnerships and trust fees. The Company recorded income of $358 thousand related to these partnerships for 2014 compared with a loss of $304 thousand in the prior year. Trust fees were up $575 thousand or 28.9%, boosted by unusually large nonrecurring estate fees of $412 thousand during the last half of 2014. Income from company-owned life insurance increased $269 thousand or 28.0%, driven by a tax-free death benefit that exceeded the cash surrender value by $276 thousand. Service charges and fees on deposits decreased $395 thousand or 4.8% primarily due to lower overdraft fees of $325 thousand or 6.6%, reflecting a decrease in volume attributed in part to overall trends in consumer behavior. Net gains on the sale of loans decreased $546 thousand or 52.7% due to a 51.0% decline in mortgage loan origination activity.\nTotal noninterest expenses were $59.3 million for 2014, a decrease of $2.3 million or 3.7% compared to $61.6 million for 2013. The decrease in noninterest expenses was made up primarily by lower expenses related to repossessed real estate of $1.7 million or 24.0% and lower deposit insurance expense of $519 thousand or 22.9%. Other noninterest expense and intangible asset amortization decreased $484 thousand or 6.2% and $135 thousand or 25.0%, respectively.\nThe $1.7 million decrease in expenses related to repossessed real estate was driven by lower impairment charges of $2.9 million or 52.4%, partially offset by an increase in the net loss on property sales of $594 thousand and higher development, operating, and maintenance expenses of $617 thousand. Deposit insurance expense decreased $519 thousand mainly from the improved risk ratings used in determining the related insurance premiums. The decrease in other noninterest expense is attributable to ongoing cost saving efforts involving numerous line items, the most significant of which was lower internet banking related expenses of $260 thousand or 31.1%. Amortization of intangible assets declined as a result of actuarial determined reductions related to core deposit and customer relationship intangible assets arising from previous business acquisitions.\nIncome tax expense was $6.1 million for 2014, an increase of $1.7 million or 37.5% compared to $4.4 million for 2013. The effective income tax rates were 27.0% and 24.8% for 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase in income tax expense and the effective tax rate is attributed primarily to higher pretax income, which was driven by a higher proportion of taxable versus tax-exempt sources of revenue.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGlossary of Financial Terms\nAllowance for loan losses\nA valuation allowance to offset credit losses specifically identified in the loan portfolio, as well as management's best estimate of probable incurred losses in the remainder of the portfolio at the balance sheet date. Management estimates the allowance balance required using past loan loss experience, an assessment of the financial condition of individual borrowers, a determination of the value and adequacy of underlying collateral, the condition of the local economy, an analysis of the levels and trends of the loan portfolio, and a review of delinquent and classified loans. Actual losses could differ significantly from the amounts estimated by management.\nDividend payout ratio\nCash dividends paid on common shares, divided by net income.\nBasis points\nEach basis point is equal to one hundredth of one percent. Basis points are calculated by multiplying percentage points times 100. For example: 3.7 percentage points equals 370 basis points.\nInterest rate sensitivity\nThe relationship between interest sensitive earning assets and interest bearing liabilities.\nNet charge-offs\nThe amount of total loans charged off net of recoveries of loans that have been previously charged off.\nNet interest income\nTotal interest income less total interest expense.\nNet interest margin\nTaxable equivalent net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets.\nNet interest spread\nThe difference between the taxable equivalent yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing funds.\nOther real estate owned\nReal estate not used for banking purposes. For example, real estate acquired through foreclosure.\nProvision for loan losses\nThe charge against current income needed to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses.\nReturn on average assets (ROA)\nNet income (loss) divided by average total assets. Measures the relative profitability of the resources utilized by the Company.\nReturn on average equity (ROE)\nNet income (loss) divided by average shareholders' equity. Measures the relative profitability of the shareholders' investment in the Company.\nTax equivalent basis (TE)\nIncome from tax-exempt loans and investment securities has been increased by an amount equivalent to the taxes that would have been paid if this income were taxable at statutory rates. In order to provide comparisons of yields and margins for all earning assets, the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets is increased to make them fully equivalent to other taxable interest income investments.\nWeighted average number of common shares outstanding\nThe number of shares determined by relating (a) the portion of time within a reporting period that common shares have been outstanding to (b) the total time in that period.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following pages present management's discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Farmers Capital Bank Corporation (the Company\u201d or Parent Company\u201d), a bank holding company, and its bank and nonbank subsidiaries. Bank subsidiaries include Farmers Bank & Capital Trust Company ( Farmers Bank\u201d) in Frankfort, KY, United Bank & Trust Company ( United Bank\u201d) in Versailles, KY, First Citizens Bank ( First Citizens\u201d) in Elizabethtown, KY, and Citizens Bank of Northern Kentucky, Inc. ( Citizens Northern\u201d) in Newport, KY. All significant intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation.\nAt year-end 2015, Farmers Bank had two primary subsidiaries, which include EG Properties, Inc., and Farmers Capital Insurance Corporation ( Farmers Insurance\u201d). EG Properties, Inc. is involved in real estate management and liquidation for certain repossessed properties of Farmers Bank. Farmers Insurance is an insurance agency in Frankfort, KY. Leasing One Corporation, a company formed to lease commercial property, was dissolved effective at year-end 2015. United Bank has one direct subsidiary, EGT Properties, Inc. EGT Properties, Inc. is involved in real estate management and liquidation for certain repossessed properties of United Bank. First Citizens has one subsidiary, HBJ Properties, LLC. HBJ Properties, LLC is involved in real estate management and liquidation for certain repossessed properties of First Citizens. Citizens Northern has one direct subsidiary, ENKY Properties, Inc., which is involved in real estate management and liquidation for certain repossessed properties of Citizens Northern.\nThe Company had two active nonbank subsidiaries in 2015, FCB Services, Inc. ( FCB Services\u201d), and FFKT Insurance Services, Inc. ( FFKT Insurance\u201d). FCB Services is a data processing subsidiary located in Frankfort, KY that provides services to the Company's banks as well as unaffiliated entities. FFKT Insurance is a captive property and casualty insurance company insuring primarily deductible exposures and uncovered liability related to properties of the Company. EKT Properties, Inc., which was dissolved effective December 31, 2014, was formed to manage and liquidate certain real estate properties repossessed by the Company. At year-end 2015, the Company had three subsidiaries organized as Delaware statutory trusts that were not consolidated into its financial statements. These trusts were formed for the purpose of issuing trust preferred securities. In January 2016, the Company terminated one of the three trusts as a result of the early extinguishment of debt issued to the trust. For additional information, refer to Note 24 of the Company's 2015 audited consolidated financial statements.\nFor a complete list of the Company's subsidiaries, please refer to the discussion under the heading Organization\u201d included in Part 1, Item 1 of this Form 10-K. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related footnotes that follow.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis report contains forward-looking statements with the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act\u201d) and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act\u201d), under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that involve risks and uncertainties. Statements in this report that are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. In general, forward-looking statements relate to a discussion of future financial results or projections, future economic performance, future operational plans and objectives, and statements regarding the underlying assumptions of such statements. Although management of the Company believes that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements contained herein are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate, and therefore, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements included herein will prove to be accurate.\nVarious risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the Company's forward-looking statements. In addition to the risks described under Part 1, Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d in this report, factors that could cause actual results to differ from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: economic conditions (both generally and more specifically in the markets in which the Company and its subsidiaries operate) and lower interest margins; competition for the Company's customers from other providers of financial services; deposit outflows or reduced demand for financial services and loan products; government legislation, regulation, and changes in monetary and fiscal policies (which changes from time to time and over which the Company has no control); changes in interest rates; changes in prepayment speeds of loans or investment securities; inflation; material unforeseen changes in the liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of the Company's customers; changes in the level of non-performing assets and charge-offs; changes in the number of common shares outstanding; the capability of the Company to successfully enter into a definitive agreement for and close anticipated transactions; unexpected claims or litigation against the Company; expected insurance or other recoveries; technological or operational difficulties; the impact of new accounting pronouncements and changes in policies and practices that may be adopted by regulatory agencies; acts of war or terrorism; the ability of the Parent Company to receive dividends from its subsidiaries; the impact of larger or similar financial institutions encountering difficulties, which may adversely affect the banking industry or the Company; the Company or its subsidiary banks' ability to maintain required capital levels and adequate funding sources and liquidity; and other risks or uncertainties detailed in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of the Company.\nThe Company's forward-looking statements are based on information available at the time such statements are made. The Company expressly disclaims any intent or obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect changes in underlying assumptions or factors, new information, future events, or other changes.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies\nThe Company's audited consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and follow general practices applicable to the banking industry. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. These estimates, assumptions, and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements. Certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. Estimates, assumptions, and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value, when a decline in the value of an asset warrants an impairment write-down or valuation reserve to be established, or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event. Carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility between reporting periods. The fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by third-party sources, when available. When third-party information is not available, valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management primarily through the use of internal cash flow modeling techniques.\nThe most significant accounting policies followed by the Company are presented in Note 1 of the Company's 2015 audited consolidated financial statements. These policies, along with the disclosures presented in other financial statement notes and in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined. Based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods, assumptions, and estimates underlying those amounts, management has identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses and fair value measurements to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments, and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses represents credit losses specifically identified in the loan portfolio, as well as management's estimate of probable incurred credit losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. Determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience, and consideration of current economic trends and conditions, all of which may be susceptible to significant changes. The loan portfolio also represents the largest asset group on the consolidated balance sheets. Additional information related to the allowance for loan losses that describes the methodology and risk factors can be found under the captions Asset Quality\u201d and Nonperforming Assets\u201d in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, as well as Notes 1 and 4 of the Company's 2015 audited consolidated financial statements.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe carrying value of certain financial assets and liabilities of the Company is impacted by the application of fair value measurements, either directly or indirectly. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In certain cases, an asset or liability is measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis, such as investment securities classified as available for sale and money market mutual funds. In other cases, management must rely on estimates or judgments to determine if an asset or liability not measured at fair value warrants an impairment write-down or whether a valuation reserve should be established.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of a financial instrument using a variety of valuation methods. Where financial instruments are actively traded and have quoted market prices, quoted market prices are used for fair value. Active markets are those where transaction volumes are sufficient to provide objective pricing information with reasonably narrow bid/ask spreads and where quoted prices do not vary widely. When the financial instruments are not actively traded, other observable market inputs such as quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics may be used, if available, to determine fair value. Inactive markets are characterized by low transaction volumes, price quotations that vary substantially among market participants, or in which minimal information is released publicly.\nWhen observable market prices do not exist, the Company estimates fair value primarily by using cash flow and other financial modeling methods. The valuation methods may also consider factors such as liquidity and concentration concerns. Other factors such as model assumptions, market dislocations, and unexpected correlations can affect estimates of fair value. Changes in these underlying factors, assumptions, or estimates in any of these areas could materially impact the amount of revenue or loss recorded.\nAdditional information regarding fair value measurements can be found in Notes 1 and 19 of the Company's 2015 audited consolidated financial statements. The following is a summary of the Company's more significant assets that may be affected by fair value measurements, as well as a brief description of the current accounting practices and valuation methodologies employed by the Company:\nAvailable For Sale Investment Securities and Money Market Mutual Funds\nInvestment securities classified as available for sale and money market mutual funds are measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis. These instruments are valued primarily by independent third party pricing services under the market valuation approach that include, but are not limited to, the following inputs:\n \u25cf Mutual funds and equity securities are priced utilizing real-time data feeds from active market exchanges for identical securities; and \n \u25cf Government-sponsored agency debt securities, obligations of states and political subdivisions, mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds, and other similar investment securities are priced with available market information through processes using benchmark yields, matrix pricing, prepayment speeds, cash flows, live trading data, and market spreads sourced from new issues, dealer quotes, and trade prices, among others sources. \nAt December 31, 2015, all of the Company's available for sale investment securities and money market mutual funds were measured using observable market data.\nOther Real Estate Owned\nOther real estate owned ( OREO\u201d) includes properties acquired by the Company through, or in lieu of, actual loan foreclosures and initially carried at fair value less estimated costs to sell. Fair value is generally based on third party appraisals of the property that includes comparable sales data. The carrying value of each OREO property is updated at least annually and more frequently when market conditions significantly impact the value of the property. If the carrying amount exceeds fair value less estimated costs to sell, an impairment loss is recorded through expense. OREO is subsequently accounted for at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs to sell. At December 31, 2015, OREO was $21.8 million compared to $32.0 million at year-end 2014.\nImpaired Loans\nLoans are considered impaired when it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impaired loans are measured at the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, at the loan's observable market price, or at the fair value of the collateral based on recent appraisals if the loan is collateral dependent. If the value of an impaired loan is less than the unpaid balance, the difference is credited to the allowance for loan losses with a corresponding charge to provision for loan losses. Loan losses are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan is confirmed.\nAppraisals used in connection with valuing collateral-dependent loans may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Appraisers take absorption rates into consideration and adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process to identify differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Such adjustments consist mainly of estimated costs to sell that are not included in certain appraisals or to update appraised collateral values as a result of market declines of similar properties for which a newer appraisal is available. These adjustments can be significant. Impaired loans were $37.2 million and $44.0 million at year-end 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nEXECUTIVE LEVEL OVERVIEW\nThe Company offers a variety of financial products and services at its 34 banking locations in 21 communities throughout Central and Northern Kentucky. The Company has four separately chartered commercial banks that operate under a community banking philosophy. This philosophy focuses primarily on understanding the banking needs of those in our local and surrounding communities and providing them with competitively priced products and a high level of personalized service. The most significant products and services the Company offers include consumer and business lending, checking, savings, and other deposit accounts, automated teller machines, electronic bill payments, and providing trust services and other traditional banking products and services. The primary goals of the Company are to continually improve profitability and shareholder value, increase and maintain a strong capital position, provide excellent service to our customers through our community banking structure, and to provide a challenging and rewarding work environment for our employees.\nThe Company generates a significant amount of its revenue, cash flows, and net income from interest income and net interest income. The ability to properly manage net interest income under changing market environments is crucial to the success of the Company. Managing credit risk also has a significant influence on the operating results of the Company. While the overall economy has largely improved since the recessionary period between 2007 and 2009 ( Recession\u201d), the Company continues to face an elevated level of nonperforming assets that built up following the Recession. The Company has focused a significant amount of effort to reduce its nonperforming assets over the last several years which has led to a substantial decline of nearly 60% when compared with its peak of $135 million during 2010. Nonperforming assets are at the lowest level since the first quarter of 2009.\nAs a result of increased business development efforts, the loan portfolio of the Company grew during 2015, the first year-over-year increase since 2008. Although end of period loan balances increased in the comparison, the Company continues its commitment to strong credit underwriting standards, which has at times hindered the opportunity to increase loans. Soft loan demand in the early to middle part of 2015 resulted in a decrease in the average loan balance of $35.2 million or 3.6% compared to a year earlier. Strengthened credit underwriting standards put in place since the Recession have resulted in steady improvement in the overall credit quality of the loan portfolio and a decrease to the allowance for loan losses.\nThe economic and business environment outlook for 2016 overall is positive, although individual indicators are mixed. In 2016, the Company intends to build on its recent loan growth and continue to reduce nonperforming assets. To further increase profitability, the Company will focus on increasing productivity and lowering operating costs. Since redeeming the final portion of its preferred stock during 2015, the Company is now considering additional alternatives as to the best use of its capital going forward to build shareholder value. In January 2016, the Company announced a dividend of $0.07 per common share and the early extinguishment of $15 million of debt. These two events reflect the initiatives of prudent use of capital and increasing shareholder value. The early extinguishment of debt resulted in a $4.1 million or $.36 per common share gain.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe Company reported net income of $15.0 million for 2015 a decrease of $1.5 million or 8.9% compared to $16.5 million for 2014. On a per common share basis, net income was $1.95 and $1.94 for 2015 and 2014, respectively. Per common share net income was positively impacted by the Company's redemption of its outstanding preferred shares, which decreased preferred dividends by $1.5 million in the comparison. The preferred share redemptions took place in three separate transactions of 10,000 shares each beginning in the second quarter of 2014 and concluding in June 2015. Selected income statement amounts and related information is presented in the table below.\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td> (In thousands, except per share data)\nYears Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>61,236 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>64,352 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3,116 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,641 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,153 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,512 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52,595 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54,199 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,604 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for loan losses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,429 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,364 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>935 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest income after provision for loan losses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56,024 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58,563 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,539 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Noninterest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,211 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,273 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,062 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Noninterest expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57,950 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59,278 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,328 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income before income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,285 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,558 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,273 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,293 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,099 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(806 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,992 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,459 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,467 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less preferred stock dividends and discount accretion\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>395 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,927 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,532 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income available to common shareholders\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,597 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,532 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>65 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Basic and diluted net income per common share\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.95 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.94 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>.01 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average common shares outstanding - basic and diluted\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,494 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,483 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Return on average assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>.84 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>.92 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> (8) bp\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Return on average equity\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.61 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.30 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> (69) bp\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nbp - basis points.\nThe more significant components related to the Company's results of operations are included below.\nInterest Income\nInterest income results from interest earned on earning assets, which primarily includes loans and investment securities. Interest income is affected by volume (average balance), the composition of earning assets, and the related rates earned on those assets. Total interest income for 2015 was $61.2 million, a decrease of $3.1 million or 4.8% compared to $64.4 million for 2014. The decrease in interest income was driven by lower interest from loans of $2.0 million or 4.0%, which was negatively impacted primarily by a decline in the average balance and, to a lesser degree, a lower average rate earned. Interest income on investment securities decreased $1.2 million or 8.1%, driven by a lower average rate earned.\nThe decrease in the average balance of loans has been accelerated by early payoffs primarily in the earlier part of 2015. The early payoffs relate to several larger balance credits that were refinanced by competitors with terms below the Company's underwriting standards. In recent years, the Company has focused on strengthening its credit underwriting standards, which has improved the overall credit quality of the loan portfolio. When high quality loan demand is low, available funds are redirected to lower yielding investment securities or cash equivalents or used to manage liquidity. The average interest rates on loans decreased three basis points during 2015, which is reflective of the sluggish economy, competitive factors, and the Company's ongoing strategy to be more selective in pricing both its loans and deposits.\nThe overall interest rate environment at year-end 2015, as measured by the Treasury yield curve, remains at very low levels when compared with historical trends. The yield curve flattened in the year-over-year comparison, particularly when comparing the two and ten-year maturity periods. The yields on shorter-term maturity periods, particularly six-month and two-year, increased more significantly than the yields related to longer periods such as the ten and thirty-year maturities. The six-month and two-year maturities increased 37 and 36 basis points, respectively, while yields on the ten and thirty-year maturities increased 8 and 26 basis points, respectively. At year-end 2015, the short-term federal funds interest rate target range was between 0.25% and 0.50%, which was increased during December 2015 from a target of zero to 0.25%. The Federal Reserve Board ( Federal Reserve\u201d) has indicated that it will continue to assess progress toward its objective of maximum employment and two percent inflation when determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target rate. At December 31, 2015, the national and Kentucky unemployment rates were 5.0% and 5.3%, respectively. At year-end 2015, the national inflation rate was 0.7% based on the Consumer Price Index published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense results from incurring interest on interest bearing liabilities, which are made up of interest bearing deposits, federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and other borrowed funds. Interest expense is affected by volume, composition of interest bearing liabilities, and the related rates paid on those liabilities. Total interest expense was $8.6 million for 2015, a decrease of $1.5 million or 14.9% compared to $10.2 million for 2014. The decrease in interest expense is attributed primarily to lower interest on deposits of $1.3 million or 30.4%. Both rate declines and lower volume contributed to the decrease, with a significant amount of the decrease related to time deposits. The Company has continued to aggressively reprice higher-rate maturing time deposits downward to lower market rates or to allow them to mature without renewal. Interest expense on long-term borrowings decreased $216 thousand or 3.7%, primarily due to a lower average balance of Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB\u201d) borrowings.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income is the most significant component of the Company's operating earnings. Net interest income is the excess of the interest income earned on earning assets over the interest paid for funds to support those assets. The two most common metrics used to analyze net interest income are net interest spread and net interest margin. Net interest spread represents the difference between the taxable equivalent yields on earning assets and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities. Net interest margin represents the percentage of taxable equivalent net interest income to average earning assets. Net interest margin will exceed net interest spread because of the existence of noninterest bearing sources of funds, principally demand deposits and shareholders' equity, which are also available to fund earning assets.\nChanges in net interest income and margin result from the interaction between the volume and composition of earning assets, their related yields, and the associated cost and composition of the interest bearing liabilities. Accordingly, portfolio size, composition, and the related yields earned and the average rates paid have a significant impact on net interest spread and margin. The table following this discussion represents the major components of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities on a tax equivalent basis. To compare the tax-exempt asset yields to taxable yields, amounts in the table are adjusted to pretax equivalents based on the marginal corporate Federal tax rate of 35%.\nTax equivalent net interest income was $54.3 million for 2015, a decrease of $1.6 million or 2.8% compared to $55.8 million for 2014. Net interest margin was 3.29% for 2015, a decrease of eight basis points from 3.37% for the prior year. The decrease in net interest margin was driven by a seven basis point decline in net interest spread, which was 3.14% for 2015 compared to 3.21% for 2014.\nThe Company actively monitors and proactively manages the rate sensitive components of both its assets and liabilities in a continuously changing and difficult market environment. Competition in the Company's market areas continues to be intense, and market interest rates remain very low by historical measures. The Federal Reserve increased the short-term federal funds target rate by a quarter percent in December 2015, the first change to this rate since December 2008, and has indicated that it expects only gradual adjustments in its stance on monetary policy.\nSimilar to the short-term federal funds target rate, the prime interest rate rose a quarter percent in December 2015. The Company uses the prime interest rate as part of its pricing model primarily on variable rate commercial real estate loans. The prime interest rate can have a significant impact on the Company's interest income from loans that reprice based on changes to this rate. The Company's variable interest rate loans contain provisions that limit the amount of increase or decrease in the interest rate during the life of a loan. This will limit the increase or decrease in interest income on loans that have interest rates tied to the prime interest rate. For 2015, the average yield earned on loans was 5.17%, which exceeded the prime interest rate of 3.50% at year-end. Predicting the direction and timing of future interest rates is uncertain.\nFor 2015, the average rate of the Company's two most significant components of net interest income, loans and time deposits, both declined. The average rate earned on the Company's loan portfolio for 2015 declined three basis points to 5.17% and the average rate paid on time deposits decreased 16 basis points to 0.64% compared to 2014. The Company expects its net interest margin to remain relatively flat in the near term based on internal modeling using expectations about future market interest rates, loan volume, the maturity structure of the Company's earning assets and liabilities, and other factors. Future results, however, could be significantly different than expectations.\nDistribution of Assets, Liabilities and Shareholders' Equity: Interest Rates and Interest Differential\nTable 101: <table>

Company recorded a credit to the provision for loan losses in the amount of $3.4 million and $4.4 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of outstanding loans (net of unearned income) was 1.08% at December 31, 2015 compared to 1.50% at year-end 2014. The credit to the provision for loan losses is attributed to continued improvement in the credit quality of the loan portfolio. The decrease in the credit to the provision is mainly driven by growth of $27.3 million in the loan portfolio during 2015 compared to a decline of $67.9 million in loans outstanding during 2014. Further information about improvements in the Company's overall credit quality is included under the captions Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d and Nonperforming Loans\u201d that follows.\nNet charge-offs were $224 thousand and $2.2 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively, down $2.0 million or 90.0% in the comparison.

All other services charges and fees on deposits increased $140 thousand or 4.3% net. \n \u25cf Allotment processing fees are down 13.8% in the comparison due to lower volume. The decrease in volume relates to the U.S. Department of Defense ( DOD\u201d) policy that became effective January 1, 2015, which restricts the types of purchases active service members are able to make using the military allotment system for payment. \n \u25cf The increase in other service charges, commissions, and fees is attributed primarily to higher interchange fees of $169 thousand or 5.7% due to higher debit card transaction volumes. The Company also received a nonrecurring fee of $63 thousand during 2015 related to credit card merchant activity. \n \u25cf The decrease in trust fees was driven by unusually large nonrecurring estate fees of $412 thousand during the last half of 2014, offset by nonrecurring fees of $131 thousand in the current year. Overall, trust assets at year-end 2015 were down $7.5 million or 1.2% from a year ago driven mainly by lower market values of managed assets. \n \u25cf The net loss on investment securities for in the prior year includes $95 thousand attributed to a municipal bond issuer participating in the Build America Bond ( BAB\u201d) program. The issuer exercised its extraordinary redemption privilege, which was triggered by Federal budget sequestration events. Since the carrying value of the bond exceeded the par value due to unamortized premium, the Company recorded a loss on this investment during 2014. The remaining unamortized premium of BAB investments at December 31, 2015 was $16 thousand, with the related carrying amount of the investments totaling $971 thousand. \n \u25cf Net gains on the sale of mortgage loans in the current quarter includes $131 thousand related to two larger-balance commercial mortgage loans with an aggregate balance of $12.3 million. The prior year includes a nonrecurring loss of $92 thousand, made up of a $46 thousand related to a group of loans reclassified from held for sale to held for investment and a group of loans sold for a loss of $46 thousand. The volume of loans sold in 2015 increased $10.9 million or 38.0% compared to 2014. \n \u25cf The decrease in income from company-owned life insurance was driven by a $276 thousand tax-free death benefit that exceeded the cash surrender value during the prior year. \n \u25cf The decrease in other income relates mainly to the Company's equity interest in its tax credit partnerships and to a nonrecurring receipt of $113 thousand during 2014 related to a legal settlement. The Company recorded income of $358 thousand related to these partnerships for 2014 and no income related to the partnerships during the current year. The cumulative share of losses related to the partnerships exceeds the amount invested, resulting in a carrying value of the partnerships of zero. \nNoninterest Expense\nThe components of noninterest expense are as follows for the periods indicated:\nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\nYears Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Salaries and employee benefits\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,008 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,763 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,245 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Occupancy expenses, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,776 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,881 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(105 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.2 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equipment expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,602 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,498 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>104 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Data processing and communication expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,300 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,031 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>269 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Bank franchise tax\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,426 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,421 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of intangibles\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>449 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>405 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deposit insurance expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,536 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,746 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(210 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12.0 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other real estate expenses, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,708 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,318 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,610 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(67.9 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Legal expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>843 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>856 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.5 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,302 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,359 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(57 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(.8 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total noninterest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>57,950 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>59,278 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,328 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.2 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe more significant items impacting noninterest expenses are included below.\n \u25cf Salaries and employee benefits increased due to higher salary and related payroll taxes of $1.3 million or 5.5%, and an increase in benefits expenses of $911 thousand or 17.1%. The increase in salaries is due to both normal employee annual increases combined with discretionary bonuses in 2015 to certain key employees totaling $495 thousand, of which $231 thousand was paid in 2016. The increase in benefits expenses was driven mainly by claims activity related to the Company's self-funded health insurance plan and an increase in the actuary-determined benefit expenses related to postretirement medical costs. Postretirement benefit expenses increased mainly due to changes in actuary assumptions used to value the plan liability and expense, primarily the assumption related to the discount rate. The Company had 501 full time equivalent employees at year-end 2015, down from 510 a year earlier. \n \u25cf Occupancy expenses decreased mainly due to lower maintenance and utilities costs of $66 thousand or 8.9% and $65 thousand or 7.6%, respectively. Maintenance and utilities costs during 2014 were high due to several large expenses related to repairs. \n \u25cf Data processing and communication expense increased 6.7%. The increase is mainly due to higher costs related to technology updates in the normal course of business. \n \u25cf The decrease to deposit insurance expense for 2015 is primarily a result of the improved risk rating by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC\u201d) at the Company's bank subsidiaries. The improved ratings reduced the assessment rate used to determine the amount payable for deposit insurance. \n \u25cf Other real estate expenses decreased as a result of lower impairment charges of $1.5 million or 58.1%, lower development, operating, and maintenance expenses of $1.5 million or 78.1%, and lower net loss on property sales of $588 thousand or 75.8%. The decrease in development, operating, and maintenance expenses were primarily related to increasing the marketability of two real estate construction projects to better position them for sale during the prior year. The two properties were subsequently sold. \nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense was $5.3 million for 2015, a decrease of $806 thousand or 13.2% compared to $6.1 million for 2014. The effective income tax rates were 26.1% and 27.0% for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in income tax expense and the effective tax rate for 2015 is attributed primarily to lower pretax income, which was driven by a higher mix of tax-exempt versus taxable sources of revenue. The effective income tax rates are lower than the U.S. statutory federal rate of 35% primarily as a result of tax-exempt interest income from loans and investment securities, income from life insurance policies, and premium income associated with the Company's captive insurance subsidiary.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nTotal assets of the Company were $1.8 billion at year-end 2015, down $6.7 million or 0.4% compared with year-end 2014. The Company's overall financial condition continued to improve in the current year. The loan portfolio grew $27.3 million or 2.9% to $959 million during 2015, the first year-over-year increase since 2008. Total nonperforming assets were $54.1 million at year-end. While still elevated, nonperforming assets have declined $80.5 million or 59.8% from their peak of $135 million in the first quarter of 2010. Although net interest margin fell eight basis points to 3.29%, loan quality metrics continued to improve throughout the year. Regulatory capital levels remain significantly above the well-capitalized\u201d threshold, even after the redemption of the final portion of the Company's preferred stock in the amount of $10.0 million during the year.\nTemporary Investments\nTemporary investments consist of interest bearing deposits in other banks, federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell, and money market mutual funds. The Company uses these funds in the management of liquidity and interest rate sensitivity or as a short-term holding prior to subsequent movement into other investments with higher yields or for other purposes. At December 31, 2015, temporary investments were $92.1 million, an increase of $18.0 million or 24.2% compared to $74.1 million at year-end 2014.\nInvestment Securities\nThe investment securities portfolio is comprised primarily of residential mortgage-backed securities, tax-exempt securities of states and political subdivisions, and debt securities issued by U.S. government-sponsored agencies. Substantially all of the Company's investment securities are designated as available for sale. Total investment securities had a carrying amount of $586 million at year-end 2015, a decrease of $44.3 million or 7.0% compared to $630 million at year-end 2014. Proceeds received from maturing or called investment securities not needed to fund higher-earning loans are either reinvested in similar investments or used to manage liquidity, such as for deposit outflows or other payment obligations. The Company periodically sells investment securities in response to its overall asset/liability management strategy to lock in gains, increase yield, restructure expected future cash flows, and/or enhance its capital position.\nThe decrease in investment securities was driven by net maturities, calls, and sales of $145 million in the aggregate, which outpaced purchases totaling $110 million. The remainder of the decrease was due to $5.6 million of net premium amortization and a $3.0 million decrease in the market value adjustment related to securities classified as available for sale. The decrease in the value of the available for sale securities portfolio is attributed to a general shift downward in bond prices during the fourth quarter, primarily for the two- and three-year maturity periods. In general, as market interest rates increase, the value of fixed rate investments decrease.\nAt year-end 2015, investment securities included $5.9 million amortized cost amounts of single-issuer trust preferred capital securities of a U.S. based global financial services firm with an estimated fair value of $5.1 million, down from $5.5 million at year-end 2014. The investment continues to perform according to contractual terms and is rated as investment grade by major rating agencies. The issuer of the securities announced in the first quarter of 2015 an increase in per share common dividend payments and authorization of a common equity repurchase plan. The Company does not intend to sell its investment in these securities, nor does the Company believe it is likely that it will be required to sell these securities prior to their anticipated recovery. The Company believes these securities are not impaired due to reasons of credit quality or other factors, but rather the unrealized loss is primarily attributed to continuing uncertainties in both international and domestic economies and market volatility. The Company believes that it will collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of these securities and that the fair values of these securities will recover as they approach their maturity dates.\nThe Company attributes the unrealized losses in other sectors of the investment securities portfolio to changes in market interest rates and volatility, and thus identifies them as temporary. As discussed further above, market interest rates generally increased throughout 2015. Investment securities with an unrealized loss at December 31, 2015 are performing according to their contractual terms, and the Company does not expect to incur a loss on these securities unless they are sold prior to maturity. The Company does not have the intent to sell these securities nor does it believe it is likely that it will be required to sell these securities prior to their anticipated recovery. The Company does not consider any of the securities to be impaired due to reasons of credit quality or other factors. All investment securities in the Company's portfolio are currently performing.\nFunds made available from sold, matured, or called bonds are redirected to fund higher yielding loan growth when available, reinvested to purchase additional investment securities, or otherwise employed to improve the composition of the balance sheet and liquidity. The purchase of nontaxable obligations of states and political subdivisions is one of the primary means of managing the Company's tax position. The impact of the alternative minimum tax related to the Company's ability to acquire tax-free obligations at an attractive yield is routinely monitored. The Company does not have direct exposure to the subprime mortgage market. The Company does not originate subprime mortgages nor has it invested in bonds that are secured by such mortgages.\nThe following table summarizes the carrying values of investment securities on December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013. The investment securities are divided into available for sale and held to maturity securities. Available for sale securities are carried at estimated fair value and held to maturity securities are carried at amortized cost. Corporate debt securities consist primarily of debt issued by a large global financial services firm. Mutual funds and equity securities are attributed to the Company's captive insurance subsidiary.\nTable 118: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Available\nfor Sale\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Held to\nMaturity\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Available\nfor Sale\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Held to\nMaturity\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Available\nfor Sale\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Held to\nMaturity\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Obligations of U.S. government-sponsored entities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>106,906 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>109,448 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>93,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Obligations of states and political subdivisions\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>150,266 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,611 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>135,766 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,728 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>131,970 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>765 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mortgage-backed securities - residential\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>297,861 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>370,489 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>378,077 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mortgage-backed securities - commercial\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,584 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,512 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>689 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate debt securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,840 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,307 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,257 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mutual funds and equity securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>745 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,866 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,077 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>582,202 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,611 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>626,388 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,728 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>612,820 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>765 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table presents an analysis of the contractual maturity and tax equivalent weighted average interest rates of investment securities at December 31, 2015. Available for sale securities are stated at estimated fair value and held to maturity securities are stated at amortized cost. Mortgage-backed securities are included in maturity categories based on their stated maturity dates. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations.

The weighted average tax rates on exempt state and political subdivisions are computed based on the marginal corporate Federal tax rate of 35%.\nLoans\nLoans, net of unearned income, were $959 million at December 31, 2015, an increase of $27.3 million or 2.9% compared to year-end 2014. The loan portfolio grew during the last three quarters of 2015, with three larger-balance commercial real estate loans totaling $26.1 million in the aggregate driving the increase in the fourth quarter. The Company continues a measured and cautious approach to loan originations while working to further reduce its level of nonperforming assets as economic growth remains slow. Generating high quality loans continues to be a challenge, and the increase in outstanding loans occurred despite early payoffs of several larger balance credits. These early payoffs were primarily the result of several larger credits that were refinanced by competitors, many of which were with terms below the Company's underwriting standards. Loan payments include $4.5 million related to nonaccrual loans and $3.9 million related to performing restructured loans.\nFrom time to time the Company may purchase a limited amount of loans originated by otherwise nonaffiliated third parties. The Company performs its own risk assessment and makes the credit decision on each loan prior to purchase. The Company purchased smaller balance commercial loans totaling $8.3 million and $3.8 million in the aggregate during 2015 and 2014, respectively. The average amount of the purchased loans was $115 thousand for 2015 and $80 thousand for 2014.\nThe composition of the loan portfolio is summarized in the table that follows. Based on economic forecasts and other available information, the Company expects continued gradual improvements to the local and regional economy during the coming year. An improving economy, particularly where the labor force participation rates increase, could lead to continued growth in the loan portfolio.\nTable 121: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial, financial, and agricultural\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>89,820 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>85,028 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>92,827 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>87,440 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>93,807 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate mortgage - construction and land development\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>115,516 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>97,045 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>101,352 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>102,454 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>119,989 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate mortgage - residential\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>355,134 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>361,022 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>371,582 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>368,762 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>397,357 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate mortgage - farmland and other commercial enterprises\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>386,386 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>375,277 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>418,147 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>425,477 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>432,438 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Installment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,419 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,413 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,092 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,247 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,365 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lease financing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>158 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>883 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,615 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,152 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>959,275 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>931,943 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>999,883 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,004,995 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,072,108 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn an average basis, loans represented 56.6% of earning assets for 2015, a decrease of 183 basis points compared to 58.5% for 2014. As loan demand changes, available funds are reallocated between temporary investments or investment securities, which typically involve a decrease in credit risk and result in lower yields. The Company does not have direct exposure to the subprime mortgage market. The Company does not originate subprime mortgages nor has it invested in bonds that are secured by such mortgages. Subprime mortgage lending is defined by the Company generally as lending to a borrower that would not qualify for a mortgage loan at prevailing market rates or whereby the underwriting decision is based on limited or no documentation of the ability to repay.\nThe following table presents the amount of commercial, financial, and agricultural loans and loans secured by real estate outstanding at December 31, 2015 which, based on remaining scheduled repayments of principal, are due in the periods indicated.\nLoan Maturities\nTable 122: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Within One Year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> After One But Within Five Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> After Five Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial, financial, and agricultural\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,408 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41,084 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,328 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>89,820 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate mortgage - construction and land development\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,685 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45,061 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,770 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>115,516 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate mortgage - residential\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,232 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>83,048 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>250,854 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>355,134 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate mortgage - farmland and other commercial enterprises\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,275 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>170,236 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>185,875 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>386,386 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>106,600 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>339,429 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>500,827 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>946,856 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table below presents the amount of commercial, financial, and agricultural loans and loans secured by real estate outstanding at December 31, 2015 that are due after one year, classified according to sensitivity to changes in interest rates.\nInterest Sensitivity\nTable 123: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fixed\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Variable\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Rate\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Due after one but within five years\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>291,550 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47,879 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Due after five years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>136,036 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>364,791 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>427,586 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>412,670 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAsset Quality\nThe Company's loan portfolio is subject to varying degrees of credit risk. Credit risk is mitigated by diversification within the portfolio, limiting exposure to any single customer or industry, rigorous lending policies and underwriting criteria, and collateral requirements. The Company maintains policies and procedures to ensure that the granting of credit is done in a sound and consistent manner. This includes policies on a company-wide basis that require certain minimum standards to be maintained by its subsidiary banks. However, the policies also permit the subsidiary companies authority to adopt standards that are no less stringent than those included in the company-wide policies. Credit decisions are made at the subsidiary bank level under guidelines established by policy. The Company's internal audit department performs loan reviews at each subsidiary bank during the year. This review evaluates loan administration, credit quality, documentation, compliance with Company loan standards, and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a consolidated and subsidiary basis.\nThe provision for loan losses represents charges or credits made to earnings to maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level considered adequate to provide for probable incurred credit losses at the balance sheet date. The allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance increased by the provision for loan losses and decreased by net charge-offs. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance.\nThe allowance for loan losses and related provision for loan losses generally fluctuate relative to the level of nonperforming and impaired loans, but other factors impact the amount of the allowance. The Company estimates the adequacy of the allowance using a risk-rated methodology based on the Company's past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral securing loans, composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions, and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates that may be susceptible to change.\nThe allowance for loan losses consists of specific and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired. The general component covers non-impaired loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current risk factors. Allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans, but the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in management's judgment, should be charged off. Actual loan losses could differ significantly from the amounts estimated by management.\nThe Company's risk-rated methodology includes segregating non-impaired watch list and past due loans from the general portfolio and allocating a loss percentage to these loans depending on their status. For example, watch list loans, which may be identified by the internal loan review risk-rating process or by regulatory examiner classification, are assigned a certain loss percentage while loans past due 30 days or more are assigned a separate loss percentage. Each of these loss rates considers past experience as well as current factors. The remainder of the general loan portfolio is segregated into portfolio segments having similar risk characteristics identified as follows: real estate loans, commercial loans, and consumer loans. Each of these portfolio segments is assigned a loss percentage based on their respective sixteen quarter rolling historical loss rates, adjusted for qualitative risk factors.\nThe qualitative risk factors used in the methodology are consistent with the guidance in the most recent Interagency Policy Statement on the Allowance for Loan Losses issued. Each factor is supported by a detailed analysis performed at each subsidiary bank and is both measureable and supportable. Some factors include a minimum allocation in some instances where loss levels are extremely low and it is determined to be prudent from a safety and soundness perspective. Qualitative risk factors that are used in the methodology include the following for each loan portfolio segment:\nTable 124: <table> <tr> <td> \u25cfDelinquency trends\n</td> <td> \u25cfManagement experience risk\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u25cfTrends in net charge-offs\n</td> <td> \u25cfConcentration of credit risk\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u25cfTrends in loan volume\n</td> <td> \u25cfEconomic conditions risk\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u25cfLending philosophy risk\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nA loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Loans for which the terms have been modified resulting in a concession, and for which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties, are considered troubled debt restructurings and classified as impaired. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower's prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed.\nWhile the overall economy experienced further improvement in 2015, the Company continued its steady progress in reducing its level of nonperforming assets. The Recession resulted in an accumulation of nonperforming assets, and significant deterioration in the Company's credit quality and collateral values, primarily in residential real estate lending. Credit quality has improved significantly over the last few years, as loan underwriting standards have been strengthened and nonperforming asset levels have declined nearly 60% from the peak that occurred in 2010. Although overall economic growth remains slow, the key economic measures have largely recovered from the Recession. In Kentucky, housing starts continue to gradually increase and foreclosure rates are at the lowest rate since 2007. At year-end 2015, the national and Kentucky unemployment rate was 5.0% and 5.3%, respectively. Unemployment rates have improved significantly from a year ago, but labor force participation rates remain near 30-year lows.\nWith the continued improvement in the credit quality of the loan portfolio, the level of nonperforming assets are at the lowest level since the first quarter of 2009. Nonperforming loans were $32.2 million at year-end, a decrease of $3.7 million for the year and $75.7 million or 70.1% since peaking at $108 million in the first quarter of 2010. The Company includes accruing restructured loans as a component of its nonperforming loans. Such loans were $23.8 million at year-end 2015 and account for 74.0% of nonperforming loans. Of the $23.8 million in accruing restructured loans, $22.2 million consist of three larger-balance credit relationships secured by various types of real estate collateral. Nonaccrual loans were $8.4 million at year-end 2015, down $3.1 million or 27.2% for the year. Nonperforming assets as a percent of total assets fell eight basis points to 3.0%. High levels of nonperforming assets generally result in loan charge-offs, provisions for loan losses, and impairment charges on repossessed real estate. The Company works with its loan customers on an individual case-by-case basis in order to maximize loan repayments on its challenged credits and typically does not restructure those that are past due.\nImpaired loans are those in which the Company does not expect to receive full payment under the contractual terms. Impaired loans are measured at the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, at the loan's observable market price, or at the fair value of the collateral taking into consideration estimated costs to sell if the loan is collateral dependent. Collateral values are updated in accordance with policy guidelines by obtaining independent third party appraisals and monitoring sales activity of similar properties in our market area.\nAt year-end 2015, the Company had $2.9 million in specific reserves allocated to impaired loans. Of this total, $1.2 million or 41.1% is attributed to a group of loans to a single creditor totaling $7.3 million secured by a combination of a real estate development and residential real estate properties. This group of collateral dependent loans is classified as performing restructured loans at year-end 2015.\nThe Company recorded a credit to the provision for loan losses of $3.4 million in 2015, or $935 thousand lower than the $4.4 million recorded in 2014. The decreased credit is due to loan portfolio growth of $27.3 million or 2.9% during 2015 compared to a decline of $67.9 million or 6.8% during 2014. Historical loss rates, adjusted for current risk factors, have improved due to lower recent charge-off activity that has replaced higher levels that had been included in the early part of the Company's look-back period used in its allowance for loan losses methodology. The decrease in historical loss rates and charge-off activity is due primarily to stabilizing real estate values, which serves as collateral for nearly 90% of the Company's loan portfolio. The rapid declines in real estate values experienced beginning in 2008 and continuing through 2011 have leveled off significantly, and the allowance for loan losses reflects this improvement. The Company has also implemented stronger credit underwriting standards in recent years, which has improved overall credit quality measures.\nWhile historical loss rates may continue improving in the near term due to elevated charge-offs falling out of the look-back period, this improvement may not necessarily correlate to a lower provision for loan losses. Other qualitative factors, such as changes in loan volume, the overall makeup of the portfolio, economic conditions, and other risk factors applied to historical loss rates may offset to some degree the impact of decreases to the historical loss rates. Certain credit quality measures are summarized in the table that follows for the periods indicated. Several of these measures are at the best level in the last three years.\nTable 125: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Three-year\nHigh1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Three-year\nLow1\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Nonperforming loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,211 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,937 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50,537 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54,605 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,211 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Nonaccrual loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,380 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,508 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,828 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,994 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,201 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans past due 30-89 days and still accruing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>588 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,352 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,460 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,831 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>588 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans graded substandard or below\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44,220 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52,313 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75,688 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>87,973 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43,669 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impaired loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,182 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43,955 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58,339 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,182 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans, net of unearned income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>959,275 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>931,943 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>999,883 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,017,977 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>927,389 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n1Based on quarter-end balances over the previous three years.\nNet charge-offs were $224 thousand for 2015, a decrease of $2.0 million or 90.0% compared to 2014. Net charge-offs were 0.02% of average loans outstanding for 2015 compared to 0.23% for the prior year. Net charge-offs for the current and prior year are each well below the $14.2 million peak which occurred in the early part of the post-recession period of 2009. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of outstanding loans was 1.08% and 1.50% at year-end 2015 and 2014, respectively. As a percentage of nonperforming loans, the allowance for loan losses was 32.0% and 38.9% at year-end 2015 and 2014, respectively. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonaccrual loans was 123% and 121% at year-end 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nThe relatively low amount of the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans is due mainly to the makeup of nonperforming loans, where performing restructured loans represent 74.0% of total nonperforming loans outstanding at year-end 2015. The allowance attributed to credits that are restructured with lower interest rates generally represents the difference in the present value of future cash flows calculated at the loan's original effective interest rate and the new lower rate. This typically results in a reserve for loan losses that is less severe than for other loans that are collateral dependent. The allowance specifically allocated to impaired loans was $2.9 million or 7.9% of such loans at year-end 2015 compared with $3.4 million or 7.7% a year earlier.\nThe table below summarizes the loan loss experience for the past five years.\nAllowance For Loan Losses\nTable 126: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Years Ended December 31, (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance of allowance for loan losses at beginning of year\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,968 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,577 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,445 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,264 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,784 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans charged off:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial, financial, and agricultural\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,630 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>257 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>216 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,113 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate mortgage -

Nonperforming loans include nonaccrual loans, performing restructured loans, and loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest. Nonaccrual loans are considered to be an indicator of potential losses. The accrual of interest on loans is discontinued when it is determined that the collection of interest or principal is doubtful, or when a default of interest or principal has existed for 90 days or more, unless such loan is well secured and in the process of collection. Restructured loans occur when a lender, because of economic or legal reasons related to a borrower's financial difficulty, grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. Restructured loans typically include a reduction of the stated interest rate or an extension of the maturity date. The Company gives careful consideration to identifying which of its challenged credits merit a restructuring of terms that it believes will result in maximum loan repayments and mitigate possible losses. Cash flow projections are carefully scrutinized prior to restructuring any credits; past due credits are typically not granted concessions.\nNonperforming assets were $54.1 million at year-end 2015, a decrease of $13.9 million or 20.4% compared to $67.9 million at year-end 2014. Such assets have been reduced to the lowest level since peaking at $135 million in the first quarter of 2010. Nonperforming assets increased sharply during 2009 mainly as a result of prolonged weaknesses in the overall economy.\nNonperforming assets by category are presented in the table below for the dates indicated.\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans accounted for on nonaccrual basis\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,380 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,508 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,838 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,408 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>59,755 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>444 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>103 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restructured loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,831 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,429 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,255 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,349 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,125 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total nonperforming loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,211 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,937 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50,537 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53,860 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78,881 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other real estate owned\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,843 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,960 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,826 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52,562 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,157 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other foreclosed assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total nonperforming assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54,054 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>67,949 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>88,363 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>106,422 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>117,074 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ratio of total nonperforming loans to total loans (net of unearned income)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ratio of total nonperforming assets to total assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdditional details related to nonperforming loans were as follows at year-end 2015 and 2014:\nNonperforming Loans\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Nonaccrual Loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial, financial, and agriculture\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>52 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>88 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate mortgage -

From time to time the Company may modify a customer's loan, but such modifications may or may not meet the criteria for classification as a restructured troubled debt. Modifications that do not meet the criteria of a troubled debt include:\n \u25cf repricing a loan to a current market rate of interest to a borrower with good credit and adequate collateral value in order to retain the customer; \n \u25cf changing the payment frequency from monthly to quarterly, semi-annually, or annually where the loan is performing, the borrower has good credit and adequate collateral value, and the Company believes valid reasons exist for the change; or \n \u25cf extending the interest only payment period of a performing loan where the borrower has good credit and adequate collateral value in instances where a project may still be in a phase of development or leasing-up, and where the Company believes completion will occur in the near future, or such extension is otherwise in the Company's best interest. \nAs modifications are made, management evaluates whether the modification meets the criteria to be classified as a troubled debt. These criteria include two components:\n 1. The bank makes a concession on the loan terms that it would not otherwise consider, and \n 2. The borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. \nThe Company's loan policy provides guidance to its lending personnel regarding restructured loans to ensure those that are troubled debt are properly identified. Additional attention is given to restructured loans through the oversight of the Chief Credit Officer at the Parent Company to ensure that modifications meeting criteria for restructured loans are identified and properly reported.\nThe table below sets forth on an aggregate basis at December 31, 2015, the types of non-troubled debt restructurings by loan type, number of loans, average loan balance and modification type:\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> # of Loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\nLoan Type\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Average Loan Balance\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Range of Loan Balances\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\nModification Type\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td> Real estate mortgage - construction and land development\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>344 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$24 </td> <td>- </td> <td>$1,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> lowered interest rate to market rate to retain loan\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> Real estate mortgage - construction and land development\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>372 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>372 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> extended maturity due to delayed construction\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>123 </td> <td> </td> <td> Real estate mortgage - residential\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>135 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td>- </td> <td>2,153 </td> <td> </td> <td> lowered interest rate to market rate to retain loan\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> Real estate mortgage - residential\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> moved payment date from the beginning to the middle of the month\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>40 </td> <td> </td> <td> Real estate mortgage - farmland and other commercial enterprises\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>527 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>- </td> <td>4,139 </td> <td> </td> <td> lowered interest rate to market rate to retain loan\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td> Commercial\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>- </td> <td>77 </td> <td> </td> <td> lowered interest rate to market rate to retain loan\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td> Commercial\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44 </td> <td>- </td> <td>67 </td> <td> </td> <td> one consolidation of debt; one converted to amortizing payments\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td> Consumer\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>- </td> <td>195 </td> <td> </td> <td> lowered interest rate to market rate to retain loan\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> Consumer\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> changed amortization period\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn each of the modifications identified in the table above, management determined the loan was not in troubled condition due to the financial condition of the borrower and related collateral.\nThe Company has not engaged in loan splitting. Loan splitting is a practice that may occur in work-out situations whereby a loan is divided into two parts - a performing part and a nonperforming part. This benefits a lender by potentially replacing one impaired loan by one smaller good loan and one smaller bad loan. Overall charge-offs and reserve amounts are potentially reduced and the effects of adverse loan classifications may be diminished.\nThe Company's comprehensive risk-grading and loan review program includes a review of loans to assess risk and assign a grade to those loans, a review of delinquencies, and an assessment of loans for needed charge-offs or placement on nonaccrual status. The Company had loans in the amount of $54.2 million and $64.7 million at year-end 2015 and year-end 2014, respectively, which were performing but considered potential problem loans and are not included in the nonperforming loan totals in the tables above. These loans, however, are considered in establishing an appropriate allowance for loan losses. The balance outstanding for potential problem credits is mainly a result of lingering weaknesses in the overall economy that continue to strain some of the Company's customers. Potential problem loans include a variety of borrowers and are secured primarily by various types of real estate including commercial, construction properties, and residential real estate developments. The $10.5 million or 16.2% decrease during the year in the level of potential problem loans is attributed primarily to an overall improvement in credit quality similar to that of the overall portfolio. At December 31, 2015, the five largest potential problem credits were $12.3 million in the aggregate compared to $13.9 million at year-end 2014.\nPotential problem loans are identified on the Company's watch list and consist of loans that require close monitoring by management. Credits may be considered as a potential problem loan for reasons that are temporary or correctable, such as for a deficiency in loan documentation or absence of current financial statements of the borrower. Potential problem loans may also include credits where adverse circumstances are identified that may affect the borrower's ability to comply with the contractual terms of the loan. Other factors which might indicate the existence of a potential problem loan include the delinquency of a scheduled loan payment, deterioration in a borrower's financial condition identified in a review of periodic financial statements, a decrease in the value of the collateral securing the loan, or a change in the economic environment in which the borrower operates. Certain loans on the Company's watch list are also considered impaired and specific allowances related to these loans are established in accordance with the appropriate accounting guidance.\nOther real estate owned includes real estate properties acquired by the Company through, or in lieu of, actual loan foreclosures. At year-end 2015, OREO was $21.8 million, a decrease of $10.1 million or 31.7% compared to $32.0 million at year-end 2014. OREO has declined $30.7 million or 58.4% from its peak of $52.6 million, which occurred at year-end 2012.\nOREO activity for 2015 was as follows:\nTable 137: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance at December 31, 2014\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,960 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transfers from loans and other increases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,514 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Proceeds from sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10,342 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on sales, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(188 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Write downs and other decreases, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,101 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance at December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,843 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe reduction in OREO was driven by property sales and impairment charges of $10.5 million and $1.1 million, respectively, which more than offset new acquisitions. Six larger-balance properties with a carrying value of $6.7 million in the aggregate were sold during 2015. This includes three larger-balance residential real estate development properties that sold for $3.5 million in total with a net loss of $75 thousand, and three larger-balance commercial real estate properties sold for $3.1 million in total with a net loss of $123 thousand. The Company's had two OREO properties at year-end 2015 with a carrying amount in excess of $2.0 million each: one commercial real estate property of $2.6 million, and one commercial rental real estate property of $2.6 million.\nDeposits\nThe Company's primary source of funding for its lending and investment activities results from its customer deposits, which consist of noninterest and interest bearing demand, savings, and time deposits. A summary of the Company's deposits is presented in the table that follows. The decrease in time deposits is a result of the Company's high liquidity position and from its strategy to lower overall funding costs, mainly by allowing higher-rate certificates of deposit to roll off or reprice at significantly lower interest rates. Many of those balances have been moved into interest or noninterest bearing demand accounts or savings accounts by the customer. As rates have decreased throughout the deposit portfolio, many customers have opted to transfer funds from maturing time deposits or investments from other sources into short-term demand or savings accounts. The Company has not sought out or accepted brokered deposits in the past nor does it have plans to do so in the future.\nA summary of the Company's deposits is as follows for the dates

borrowings include funding sources with an original maturity of one year or less. The Company's short-term borrowings consist of federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, which are generally on an overnight basis. Short-term borrowings primarily represent funds that have been swept out of the deposit accounts of certain qualifying commercial customers into repurchase agreements and accounted for as secured borrowings. A summary of short-term borrowings is as follows:\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amount outstanding at year-end\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34,353 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,590 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,123 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Maximum month-end balance during the year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,474 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,568 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,885 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average outstanding\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,580 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,428 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,440 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average rate during the year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>.16 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>.18 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>.25 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average rate at year-end\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>.24 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>.16 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>.25 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLong-term Borrowings\nLong-term borrowings include funding sources with an original maturity greater than one year. The Company's long-term borrowings are comprised of securities sold under agreements to repurchase, FHLB advances, and subordinated notes payable to unconsolidated trusts. Long-term securities sold under agreements to repurchase primarily represent obligations related to the Company's balance sheet leverage transaction that originated in 2007. In this transaction, the Company borrowed $200 million through multiple fixed rate repurchase agreements and used the proceeds to purchase fixed rate Government National Mortgage Association ( GNMA\u201d) bonds that are pledged as collateral. The Company is required to secure the borrowed funds with GNMA bonds valued at 106% of the outstanding principal balance of the borrowings. Principal payments have reduced the outstanding balance of the obligation to $100 million at year-end 2015, with a weighted average interest rate of 3.95%. These borrowings are callable quarterly and mature in November 2017.\nThe Company has $1.5 million of other long-term repurchase agreements outstanding at year-end 2015 made in the ordinary course of business with commercial customers. These borrowings have a weighted average fixed rate of 0.88% with portions maturing in each subsequent year through 2019.\nFHLB advances to the Company's subsidiary banks are secured by restricted holdings of FHLB stock which participating banks are required to own as well as certain mortgage loans as required by the FHLB. FHLB advances are made pursuant to several different credit programs, which have their own interest rates and range of maturities. Interest rates on FHLB advances are fixed and range between 2.99% and 5.81%, with a weighted average rate of 3.98%. Remaining maturities of FHLB advances extend over multiple time periods through 2020, with a weighted average remaining term of 1.8 years. FHLB advances are generally used to increase the Company's lending activities and to aid the efforts of asset and liability management by utilizing various repayment options offered by the FHLB. Long-term advances from the FHLB totaled $18.8 million and $19.0 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. This represents a decrease of $155 thousand or 0.8% and is attributed to scheduled repayment activity. The Company has not initiated any long-term FHLB borrowings since 2008.\nIn 2005 and 2007, the Company completed a total of three private offerings of trust preferred securities through separate Delaware statutory trusts (the Trusts\u201d) sponsored by the Company in the aggregate amount of $47.5 million. The combined $25.0 million proceeds from the first two trusts ( Trusts I and II\u201d) established in 2005 were used to fund the acquisition of Citizens Bancorp. Proceeds from the third trust ( Trust III\u201d) were used primarily to acquire Company shares through a tender offer during 2007. The Company owns all of the common securities of each of the three Trusts. Subsequent to year-end 2015, the Company terminated Trust II as a result of the early extinguishment of debt issued to the trust. Refer to Note 24 of the Company's 2015 audited consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nThe Trusts used the proceeds from the sale of preferred securities, plus capital of $1.5 million contributed by the Company to establish the trusts, to purchase the Company's subordinated notes in amounts and bearing terms that parallel the amounts and terms of the respective preferred securities. Amounts and general terms related to the Trusts at year-end 2015 are summarized in the table below.\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> Trust I\n</td> <td> Trust II\n</td> <td> Trust III\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subordinated notes payable\n</td> <td> $10,310\n</td> <td> $15,464\n</td> <td> $23,196\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest rate terms\n</td> <td> 3-month LIBOR +150 BP\n</td> <td> 3-month LIBOR +165 BP\n</td> <td> 3-month LIBOR +132 BP\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest rate in effect at year-end\n</td> <td> 2.10%\n</td> <td> 2.26%\n</td> <td> 1.65%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stated maturity date\n</td> <td> September 30, 2035\n</td> <td> September 30, 2035\n</td> <td> November 1, 2037\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe subordinated notes of the Trusts are redeemable in whole or in part, without penalty, at the Company's option and are junior in right of payment of all present and future senior indebtedness of the Company. The weighted average interest rate in effect as of the last determination date in 2015 and 2014 was 1.94% and 1.71%, respectively.\nContractual Obligations\nThe Company's contractual obligations to make future payments as of December 31, 2015 are as follows:\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nContractual Obligations (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> One Year or Less\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> One to Three\nYears\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Three to Five\nYears\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> More Than Five\nYears\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Time deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>325,378 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>206,083 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>98,921 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,551 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,823 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term FHLB debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,806 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>806 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subordinated notes payable\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,970 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,970 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term securities sold under agreements to repurchase\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>101,474 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>716 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100,505 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>253 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unfunded postretirement benefit obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,085 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>410 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>931 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,079 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,665 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,995 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>361 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>423 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>252 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>959 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Employment agreements\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,935 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,249 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,616 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,070 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>506,643 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>208,819 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>220,396 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,011 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>57,417 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLong-term FHLB debt represents FHLB advances pursuant to several different credit programs. Long-term FHLB debt, subordinated notes payable, and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are more fully described under the caption Long-term Borrowings\u201d above and in Note 9 of the Company's 2015 audited consolidated financial statements. Payments for borrowings in the table above do not include interest. Postretirement benefit obligations are determined by actuaries and estimated based on various assumptions with payouts projected over the next ten years. Estimates can vary significantly each year due to changes in significant assumptions. Operating leases include standard business equipment used in the Company's day-to-day business as well as the lease of certain branch sites. Operating lease terms generally range from one to five years, with the ability to extend certain branch site leases at the Company's option. Payments related to leases are based on actual payments specified in the contracts. Employment agreements represent annual minimum base salary amounts payable by the Company to six employees. The Company has employment agreements with its Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and three key officers of its subsidiaries.\nGuarantees\nDuring 2007, the Parent Company entered into a guarantee agreement whereby it agreed to become unconditionally and irrevocably the guarantor of the obligations of three of its subsidiary banks in connection with the $200 million balance sheet leverage transaction. Principal payments by the bank subsidiaries have reduced the outstanding balance of the obligation to $100 million at year-end 2015, which matures in 2017. The borrowings are required to be secured by GNMA bonds valued at 106% of the amount outstanding, although the banks typically maintain an amount in excess of the required minimum. Should any of the subsidiary banks default on its borrowings under the agreement, the GNMA bonds securing the borrowings would be liquidated to satisfy amounts due. If the value of the GNMA bonds fall below the obligation under the contract, the Parent Company is obligated to cover any such shortfall in absence of the subsidiary banks' ability to do so. The Parent Company believes its subsidiary banks are fully capable of fulfilling their obligations under the borrowing arrangement and that the Parent Company will not be required to make any payments under the guarantee agreement.\nEffects of Inflation\nThe majority of the Company's assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. Therefore, the Company differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in nonmonetary assets, such as fixed assets and inventories. However, inflation does have an important impact on the growth of assets in the banking industry and on the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio. Inflation also affects other noninterest expense, which tends to rise during periods of general inflation.\nMarket Risk Management\nMarket risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates. The Company's market risk is comprised primarily of interest rate risk created by its core banking activities of extending loans and receiving deposits. The Company's success is largely dependent upon its ability to manage this risk. Interest rate risk is defined as the exposure of the Company's net interest income to adverse movements in interest rates. Although the Company manages other risks, such as credit and liquidity risk, management considers interest rate risk to be its most significant risk, which could potentially have the largest and a material effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. A sudden and substantial change in interest rates may adversely impact the Company's earnings to the extent that the interest rates earned on assets and paid on liabilities do not change at the same speed, to the same extent, or on the same basis. Other events that could have an adverse impact on the Company's performance include changes in general economic and financial conditions, general movements in market interest rates, and changes in consumer preferences. The Company's primary purpose in managing interest rate risk is to effectively invest the Company's capital and to manage and preserve the value created by its core banking business.\nManagement believes the most significant impact on financial and operating results is the Company's ability to react to changes in interest rates. Management seeks to maintain an essentially balanced position between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against the effects of wide interest rate fluctuations.\nThe Parent Company and each of its subsidiary banks has a Corporate Asset and Liability Management Committee ( ALCO\u201d) which monitors the composition of the balance sheet to ensure comprehensive management of interest rate risk and liquidity. The Parent Company ALCO also provides guidance and support to each ALCO of the Company's subsidiary banks and is responsible for monitoring risks on a company-wide basis. The Parent Company ALCO has established minimum standards in its asset and liability management policy that each subsidiary bank must adopt. However, the subsidiary banks are permitted to deviate from these standards so long as the deviation is no less stringent than that of the Corporate policy.\nThe Company uses a simulation model as a tool to monitor and evaluate interest rate risk exposure. The model is designed to measure the sensitivity of net interest income and net income to changing interest rates over future periods. Forecasting net interest income and its sensitivity to changes in interest rates requires the Company to make assumptions about the volume and characteristics of many attributes, including assumptions relating to the replacement of maturing earning assets and liabilities. Other assumptions include, but are not limited to, projected prepayments, projected new volume, and the predicted relationship between changes in market interest rates and changes in customer account balances. These effects are combined with the Company's estimate of the most likely rate environment to produce a forecast for the next twelve months. The forecasted results are then compared to the effect of a gradual 200 basis point increase and decrease in market interest rates on the Company's net interest income and net income. Because assumptions are inherently uncertain, the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income and net income or the effect of interest rate changes on net interest income and net income. Actual results could differ significantly from simulated results.\nAt December 31, 2015, the model indicated that if rates were to gradually increase by 200 basis points over the next twelve months, then net interest income (TE) and net income would decrease 0.33% and 0.96%, respectively, compared to forecasted results. The model indicated that if rates were to gradually decrease by 200 basis points over the next twelve months, then net interest income (TE) and net income would decrease 1.91% and 5.81%, respectively, compared to forecasted results.\nIn the current low interest rate environment, it is not practical or possible to reduce certain deposit rates by the same magnitude as rates on earning assets. The average rate paid on the Company's deposits is already below 2%. This situation magnifies the model's predicted results when modeling a decrease in interest rates, as earning assets with higher yields have more of an opportunity to reprice at lower rates than lower-rate deposits.\nLIQUIDITY\nLiquidity measures the ability to meet current and future cash flow needs as they become due. For financial institutions, liquidity reflects the capacity to meet loan demand, accommodate possible outflows in deposits, and to react and capitalize on interest rate market opportunities. A financial institution's ability to meet its current financial obligations is dependent upon the structure of its balance sheet, its ability to liquidate assets, and its access to alternative sources of funds. The Company's goal is to meet its near-term funding needs by maintaining a level of liquid funds through its asset/liability management. For the longer term, the liquidity position is managed by balancing the maturity structure of the balance sheet. This process allows for an orderly flow of funds over an extended period of time. The Company's ALCOs, both at the bank subsidiary and consolidated level, meet regularly and monitor the composition of the balance sheet to ensure comprehensive management of interest rate risk and liquidity.\nThe Company's objective as it relates to liquidity is to ensure that its subsidiary banks have funds available to meet deposit withdrawals and credit demands without unduly penalizing profitability. In order to maintain a proper level of liquidity, the subsidiary banks have several sources of funds available on a daily basis. For assets, those sources of funds include liquid assets that are readily marketable or that can be pledged, or which mature in the near future. These assets primarily include cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, investment securities, and cash flow generated by the repayment of principal and interest on loans and investment securities. For liabilities, sources of funds primarily include the subsidiary banks' core deposits, FHLB and other borrowings, and federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and investment securities are generally a predictable source of funds, deposit outflows and mortgage prepayments are influenced significantly by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition in our local markets.\nThe Company uses a liquidity ratio metric to help measure its ability to meet its cash flow needs. This ratio is monitored by ALCO at both the bank and consolidated level. The liquidity ratio is based on current and projected levels of sources and uses of funds. This measure is useful in analyzing cash needs and formulating strategies to achieve desired results. For example, a low liquidity ratio could indicate that the Company's ability to fund loans might become more difficult. A high liquidity ratio could indicate that the Company may have a disproportionate amount of funds in low yielding assets, which is more likely to occur during periods of sluggish loan demand or economic difficulties. The Company's liquidity position, as measured by its liquidity ratio, decreased at year-end 2015 when compared to year-end 2014, but is within its ALCO guidelines. The Company's liquidity ratio remains elevated mainly as a result of its overall net funding position and weak, quality loan demand. The Company continues a cautious lending strategy while continuing efforts to reduce its level of nonperforming assets in a slow growing economic environment.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company had $236 million of additional borrowing capacity under various FHLB, federal funds, and other agreements. However, there is no guarantee that these sources of funds will continue to be available to the Company, or that current borrowings can be refinanced upon maturity, although the Company is not aware of any events or uncertainties that are likely to cause a decrease in the Company's liquidity from these sources.\nLiquidity at the Parent Company level is primarily affected by the receipt of dividends from its subsidiary banks, cash balances maintained, and borrowings from nonaffiliated sources. Payment of dividends by the Company's subsidiary banks is subject to certain regulatory restrictions as set forth in national and state banking laws and regulations. Capital ratios at all four of the Company's subsidiary banks exceed regulatory established well-capitalized\u201d status at December 31, 2015 under the prompt corrective action regulatory framework.\nThe Parent Company's primary uses of cash include the payment of dividends to its preferred and common shareholders, injecting capital into subsidiaries, paying interest expense on borrowings, and payments for general operating expenses. The Company redeemed 20,000 shares, or two-thirds, of its original amount of outstanding preferred stock during 2014 in two separate partial redemptions of 10,000 shares each and redeemed the remaining 10,000 shares of preferred stock during the second quarter of 2015.\nThe Parent Company had cash balances of $36.0 million at year-end 2015, an increase of $3.9 million or 12.1% compared to $32.1 million at year-end 2014. Significant cash receipts of the Parent Company for 2015 include dividend payments from its bank subsidiaries of $14.4 million, a return of capital from nonbank subsidiaries in the amount of $1.4 million, and management fees from subsidiaries of $2.5 million. Significant cash payments by the Parent Company in 2015 include $10.0 million to redeem the final portion of its outstanding preferred stock, $3.0 million for salaries, payroll taxes, and employee benefits, $862 thousand for interest on trust preferred borrowings, and $508 thousand for the payment of dividends on its previously outstanding preferred stock.\nLiquid assets consist of cash and cash equivalents and available for sale investment securities. At December 31, 2015, consolidated liquid assets were $703 million, a decrease of $24.6 million or 3.4% from year-end 2014. The decrease in liquid assets was driven by lower available for sale investment securities of $44.2 million or 7.1%, offset by higher money market mutual funds of $11.0 million and higher interest bearing deposits with other banks in the amount of $7.6 million or 11.3%. Although liquid assets decreased in the comparison, liquid assets remain elevated mainly as a result of the Company's overall net funding position and weak, high-quality loan demand. The overall funding position of the Company changes as loan demand, deposit levels, and other sources and uses of funds fluctuate.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $25.9 million and $29.0 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively. This represents a decrease of $3.1 million or 10.6%, led by a decrease in net mortgage loans sold and a lower net loss on the sale and write downs of OREO. Net cash flow from investing activities was $15.9 million for 2015 and $57.3 million for 2014. This represents a decrease of $41.4 million or 72.3%, driven by loan activity, partially offset by net investment securities. For loans, the Company had net cash outflow representing overall principal advances of $28.2 million in 2015 compared to net principal collections of $56.7 million for 2014. For investment securities, the Company had net cash inflows of $35.8 million for 2015 compared with net cash outflows of $7.0 million for the prior year. Net cash inflows related to investments represent net sale, maturity, and call activity, where proceeds received from the sale, maturity, and calls exceed purchase of investment securities. For 2015, excess cash flows from investment activity were used more to fund new loans, deposit runoff, and the redemption of the final portion of the Company's preferred stock. In 2014, cash inflows were used to fund deposit runoff, debt repayments, and the redemption of a portion of the Company's preferred stock.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $22.2 million for 2015, a decrease of $31.4 million or 58.5% from $53.6 million for 2014. The decrease was driven by preferred stock redemptions, long-term and short-term borrowing activity, and deposit activity. The Company redeemed $10.0 million of its preferred stock outstanding in 2015 and $20.0 million in 2014. The company had net proceeds on long and short-term borrowings of $556 thousand and $5.8 million, respectively, for the current year compared to net repayments of $8.2 million and $533 thousand, respectively, for 2014. Net outflows related to deposits were $18.2 million for 2015, a decrease of $4.9 million compared to $23.1 million for 2014.\nInformation relating to commitments to extend credit is disclosed in Note 15 of the Company's 2015 audited consolidated financial statements. These transactions are entered into in the ordinary course of providing traditional banking services and are considered in managing the Company's liquidity position. The Company does not expect these commitments to significantly affect the liquidity position in future periods. The Company has not entered into any contracts for financial derivative instruments such as futures, swaps, options, or similar instruments.\nCAPITAL RESOURCES\nShareholders' equity was $176 million at year-end 2015, an increase of $2.8 million or 1.6% compared to $173 million at year-end 2014. Net income for the period increased shareholders' equity by $15.0 million, partially offset by the redemption of the remaining portion of the Company's preferred stock in the amount of $10.0 million during the second quarter, and a $2.0 million after-tax decrease in the unrealized gain on available for sale investment securities. The decrease in the unrealized gain on available for sale investment securities is attributed to an increase in market interest rates. Generally, as market interest rates rise, the value of fixed rate investments such as those held by the Company, decreases.\nOn January 9, 2009, the Company issued 30,000 shares of Series A, no par value cumulative perpetual preferred stock. The Company redeemed 20,000 of the preferred shares during 2014. On June 8, 2015, the Company redeemed the final 10,000 shares at the stated liquidation value of $1,000 per share, plus accrued dividends of $58 thousand. There was no additional debt or equity issued by the Company in connection with any of the shares redeemed.\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company's tangible capital ratio was 9.89% and 9.68%, respectively. The tangible capital ratio is defined as tangible equity as a percentage of tangible assets. Tangible common equity to tangible assets, which further excludes outstanding preferred stock, was 9.89% at year-end 2015, up 77 basis points compared to 9.12% at year-end 2014.\nConsistent with the objective of operating a sound financial organization, the Company's goal is to maintain capital ratios well above the regulatory minimum requirements. The Company's capital ratios as of December 31, 2015 and the regulatory minimums were as follows:\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Farmers Capital\nBank Corporation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Regulatory\nMinimum\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-based Capital1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.91 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.50 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tier 1 Risk-based Capital1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.00 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Risk-based Capital1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.89 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.00 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tier 1 Leverage Capital2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.46 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.00 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n1Common Equity Tier 1 ( CET1\u201d) Risk-based, Tier 1 Risk-based, and Total Risk-based Capital ratios are computed by dividing Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1, or Total Capital, as defined by regulation, by a risk-weighted sum of the assets, with the risk weighting determined by general standards established by regulation. The safest assets (e.g., government obligations) are assigned a weighting of 0% with riskier assets receiving higher ratings (e.g., ordinary commercial loans are assigned a weighting of 100%).\n2Tier 1 Leverage ratio is computed by dividing Tier 1 Capital by total quarterly average assets, as defined by regulation.\nIn July 2013, banking regulators issued final rules to bring U.S. banking organizations into compliance with the Basel III capital framework effective in 2015. The Company remains well-capitalized under the new rules, including meeting the effective minimum capital ratios with a fully phased-in capital conservation buffer.

These five categories are: (1) well-capitalized, (2) adequately capitalized, (3) undercapitalized, (4) significantly undercapitalized, and (5) critically undercapitalized. To be well-capitalized, a bank must have a CET1 Risk-based Capital ratio of at least 6.5%, a Tier 1 Risk-based Capital ratio of 8%, a Total Risk-based Capital ratio of at least 10%, and a Tier 1 Leverage ratio of at least 5%. As of December 31, 2015, each of the Company's four subsidiary banks had the following capital ratios for regulatory purposes:\nTable 146: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-based Capital Ratio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Tier 1 Risk-based Capital Ratio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total Risk-based Capital Ratio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Tier 1 Leverage Capital Ratio\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Farmers Bank\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.57 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.57 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.35 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.20 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> United Bank\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.67 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.67 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.68 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.89 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> First Citizens\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.55 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.55 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.17 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.20 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Citizens Northern\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.42 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.42 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.67 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.79 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnited Bank. During January 2014, United Bank entered into a Memorandum of Understanding ( Memorandum\u201d) with the FDIC and Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions ( KDFI\u201d), which replaced regulatory agreements dating back to November 2009 primarily relating to the bank's level of nonperforming assets. This Memorandum was terminated in March 2015. In connection with the termination of the Memorandum, the Board of Directors of United Bank agreed to adopt a resolution which included many of the same provisions as the Memorandum, including the requirement to seek approval from the FDIC and KDFI prior to the payment of dividends to the Parent Company. United Bank has both complied with and satisfied the terms of the resolution. As of January 2016, all regulatory agreements and board resolutions between the FDIC, KDFI, and United Bank have been terminated.\nCitizens Northern. The FDIC and KDFI entered into a Memorandum with Citizens Northern in September 2010. This Memorandum was terminated and replaced in July 2013. The updated Memorandum included provisions that required the bank to maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio at or above 9.0% and to obtain regulatory approval before declaring or paying a dividend to the Parent Company. The Memorandum was terminated in August 2015 following a joint examination by the FDIC and KDFI, which found satisfactory compliance with the terms of the Memorandum and overall improvement in financial condition.\nShare Buy Back Program\nAt various times, the Company's Board of Directors has authorized the purchase of shares of the Company's outstanding common stock. No stated expiration dates have been established under any of the previous authorizations. There are 84,971 shares that may still be purchased under the various authorizations, though no shares have been purchased since 2008.\nShareholder Information\nAs of February 4, 2016, the Company had 2,804 shareholders of record, which includes individual participants in securities positions listings.\nCommon Stock Price\nThe Company's common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC exchange in the Global Select Market tier, with sales prices reported under the symbol: FFKT.

There were no dividends declared on the Company's common stock in 2015 or 2014.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nSee Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d under the caption Recently Issued But Not Yet Effective Accounting Standards,\u201d in the Company's 2015 audited consolidated financial statements for further information about recently issued accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on the Company's financial statements.\n2014 Compared to 2013\nThe Company reported net income of $16.5 million or $1.94 per common share in 2014 compared to $13.4 million or $1.54 per common share for 2013. This represents an increase of $3.0 million or $.40 per common share. The increase in net income is primarily attributed to a decrease in the provision for loan losses of $1.8 million, an increase in noninterest income of $1.2 million or 5.2%, and lower net interest income and noninterest expenses of $539 thousand or 1.0% and $2.3 million or 3.7%, respectively. Income tax expense increased $1.7 million or 37.5%.\nFor 2014, the decrease in net interest income from 2013 was driven by lower interest income of $2.4 million or 3.6%, which more than offset a reduction in interest expense of $1.8 million or 15.4%. Interest income on loans decreased $3.6 million or 6.7%, partially offset by an increase in interest from investment securities of $1.2 million or 9.2%. Interest expense on deposits decreased $1.7 million or 28.2%. Interest income on loans was negatively impacted by both volume declines and a lower average rate earned. The increase in interest income on investment securities was driven by higher volume. Interest expense on deposits decreased primarily due to the repricing of higher-rate time deposits to lower market interest rates and a lower average balance outstanding. Net interest margin was 3.37% for 2014, down three basis points from 3.40% for 2013. Net interest spread was 3.21%, down two basis points compared to 3.23%.\nThe Company recorded a credit to the provision for loan losses in the amount of $4.4 million and $2.6 million for 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increased credit was due to continued overall improvement in the credit quality of the loan portfolio combined with a $67.9 million or 6.8% decline in loans outstanding. Nonperforming loans, impaired loans, early stage delinquencies, and watch list loans all improved during 2014. Historical loss rates, adjusted for current risk factors, also improved as lower charge-off activity replaced the higher levels that spiked upward starting in 2009.\nNonperforming loans decreased $14.6 million or 28.9% in 2014. The allowance for loan losses was $14.0 million at year-end 2014 and $20.6 million at year-end 2013. As a percentage of loans net of unearned income, the allowance for loan losses decreased 56 basis points to 1.50% at year-end 2014 compared to 2.06% a year earlier.\nNoninterest income for 2014 was $23.3 million, an increase of $1.2 million or 5.2% compared to $22.1 million for 2013. The increase was driven mainly by income related to the Company's equity interest in its three tax credit partnerships and trust fees. The Company recorded income of $358 thousand related to these partnerships for 2014 compared with a loss of $304 thousand in the prior year. Trust fees were up $575 thousand or 28.9%, boosted by unusually large nonrecurring estate fees of $412 thousand during the last half of 2014. Income from company-owned life insurance increased $269 thousand or 28.0%, driven by a tax-free death benefit that exceeded the cash surrender value by $276 thousand. Service charges and fees on deposits decreased $395 thousand or 4.8% primarily due to lower overdraft fees of $325 thousand or 6.6%, reflecting a decrease in volume attributed in part to overall trends in consumer behavior. Net gains on the sale of loans decreased $546 thousand or 52.7% due to a 51.0% decline in mortgage loan origination activity.\nTotal noninterest expenses were $59.3 million for 2014, a decrease of $2.3 million or 3.7% compared to $61.6 million for 2013. The decrease in noninterest expenses was made up primarily by lower expenses related to repossessed real estate of $1.7 million or 24.0% and lower deposit insurance expense of $519 thousand or 22.9%. Other noninterest expense and intangible asset amortization decreased $484 thousand or 6.2% and $135 thousand or 25.0%, respectively.\nThe $1.7 million decrease in expenses related to repossessed real estate was driven by lower impairment charges of $2.9 million or 52.4%, partially offset by an increase in the net loss on property sales of $594 thousand and higher development, operating, and maintenance expenses of $617 thousand. Deposit insurance expense decreased $519 thousand mainly from the improved risk ratings used in determining the related insurance premiums. The decrease in other noninterest expense is attributable to ongoing cost saving efforts involving numerous line items, the most significant of which was lower internet banking related expenses of $260 thousand or 31.1%. Amortization of intangible assets declined as a result of actuarial determined reductions related to core deposit and customer relationship intangible assets arising from previous business acquisitions.\nIncome tax expense was $6.1 million for 2014, an increase of $1.7 million or 37.5% compared to $4.4 million for 2013. The effective income tax rates were 27.0% and 24.8% for 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase in income tax expense and the effective tax rate is attributed primarily to higher pretax income, which was driven by a higher proportion of taxable versus tax-exempt sources of revenue.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGlossary of Financial Terms\nAllowance for loan losses\nA valuation allowance to offset credit losses specifically identified in the loan portfolio, as well as management's best estimate of probable incurred losses in the remainder of the portfolio at the balance sheet date. Management estimates the allowance balance required using past loan loss experience, an assessment of the financial condition of individual borrowers, a determination of the value and adequacy of underlying collateral, the condition of the local economy, an analysis of the levels and trends of the loan portfolio, and a review of delinquent and classified loans. Actual losses could differ significantly from the amounts estimated by management.\nDividend payout ratio\nCash dividends paid on common shares, divided by net income.\nBasis points\nEach basis point is equal to one hundredth of one percent. Basis points are calculated by multiplying percentage points times 100. For example: 3.7 percentage points equals 370 basis points.\nInterest rate sensitivity\nThe relationship between interest sensitive earning assets and interest bearing liabilities.\nNet charge-offs\nThe amount of total loans charged off net of recoveries of loans that have been previously charged off.\nNet interest income\nTotal interest income less total interest expense.\nNet interest margin\nTaxable equivalent net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets.\nNet interest spread\nThe difference between the taxable equivalent yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing funds.\nOther real estate owned\nReal estate not used for banking purposes. For example, real estate acquired through foreclosure.\nProvision for loan losses\nThe charge against current income needed to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses.\nReturn on average assets (ROA)\nNet income (loss) divided by average total assets. Measures the relative profitability of the resources utilized by the Company.\nReturn on average equity (ROE)\nNet income (loss) divided by average shareholders' equity. Measures the relative profitability of the shareholders' investment in the Company.\nTax equivalent basis (TE)\nIncome from tax-exempt loans and investment securities has been increased by an amount equivalent to the taxes that would have been paid if this income were taxable at statutory rates. In order to provide comparisons of yields and margins for all earning assets, the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets is increased to make them fully equivalent to other taxable interest income investments.\nWeighted average number of common shares outstanding\nThe number of shares determined by relating (a) the portion of time within a reporting period that common shares have been outstanding to (b) the total time in that period.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following pages present management's discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Farmers Capital Bank Corporation (the Company\u201d or Parent Company\u201d), a bank holding company, and its bank and nonbank subsidiaries. Bank subsidiaries include Farmers Bank & Capital Trust Company ( Farmers Bank\u201d) in Frankfort, KY, United Bank & Trust Company ( United Bank\u201d) in Versailles, KY, First Citizens Bank ( First Citizens\u201d) in Elizabethtown, KY, and Citizens Bank of Northern Kentucky, Inc. ( Citizens Northern\u201d) in Newport, KY. All significant intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation.\nAt year-end 2015, Farmers Bank had two primary subsidiaries, which include EG Properties, Inc., and Farmers Capital Insurance Corporation ( Farmers Insurance\u201d). EG Properties, Inc. is involved in real estate management and liquidation for certain repossessed properties of Farmers Bank. Farmers Insurance is an insurance agency in Frankfort, KY. Leasing One Corporation, a company formed to lease commercial property, was dissolved effective at year-end 2015. United Bank has one direct subsidiary, EGT Properties, Inc. EGT Properties, Inc. is involved in real estate management and liquidation for certain repossessed properties of United Bank. First Citizens has one subsidiary, HBJ Properties, LLC. HBJ Properties, LLC is involved in real estate management and liquidation for certain repossessed properties of First Citizens. Citizens Northern has one direct subsidiary, ENKY Properties, Inc., which is involved in real estate management and liquidation for certain repossessed properties of Citizens Northern.\nThe Company had two active nonbank subsidiaries in 2015, FCB Services, Inc. ( FCB Services\u201d), and FFKT Insurance Services, Inc. ( FFKT Insurance\u201d). FCB Services is a data processing subsidiary located in Frankfort, KY that provides services to the Company's banks as well as unaffiliated entities. FFKT Insurance is a captive property and casualty insurance company insuring primarily deductible exposures and uncovered liability related to properties of the Company. EKT Properties, Inc., which was dissolved effective December 31, 2014, was formed to manage and liquidate certain real estate properties repossessed by the Company. At year-end 2015, the Company had three subsidiaries organized as Delaware statutory trusts that were not consolidated into its financial statements. These trusts were formed for the purpose of issuing trust preferred securities. In January 2016, the Company terminated one of the three trusts as a result of the early extinguishment of debt issued to the trust. For additional information, refer to Note 24 of the Company's 2015 audited consolidated financial statements.\nFor a complete list of the Company's subsidiaries, please refer to the discussion under the heading Organization\u201d included in Part 1, Item 1 of this Form 10-K. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related footnotes that follow.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis report contains forward-looking statements with the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act\u201d) and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act\u201d), under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that involve risks and uncertainties. Statements in this report that are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. In general, forward-looking statements relate to a discussion of future financial results or projections, future economic performance, future operational plans and objectives, and statements regarding the underlying assumptions of such statements. Although management of the Company believes that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements contained herein are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate, and therefore, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements included herein will prove to be accurate.\nVarious risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the Company's forward-looking statements. In addition to the risks described under Part 1, Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d in this report, factors that could cause actual results to differ from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: economic conditions (both generally and more specifically in the markets in which the Company and its subsidiaries operate) and lower interest margins; competition for the Company's customers from other providers of financial services; deposit outflows or reduced demand for financial services and loan products; government legislation, regulation, and changes in monetary and fiscal policies (which changes from time to time and over which the Company has no control); changes in interest rates; changes in prepayment speeds of loans or investment securities; inflation; material unforeseen changes in the liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of the Company's customers; changes in the level of non-performing assets and charge-offs; changes in the number of common shares outstanding; the capability of the Company to successfully enter into a definitive agreement for and close anticipated transactions; unexpected claims or litigation against the Company; expected insurance or other recoveries; technological or operational difficulties; the impact of new accounting pronouncements and changes in policies and practices that may be adopted by regulatory agencies; acts of war or terrorism; the ability of the Parent Company to receive dividends from its subsidiaries; the impact of larger or similar financial institutions encountering difficulties, which may adversely affect the banking industry or the Company; the Company or its subsidiary banks' ability to maintain required capital levels and adequate funding sources and liquidity; and other risks or uncertainties detailed in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of the Company.\nThe Company's forward-looking statements are based on information available at the time such statements are made. The Company expressly disclaims any intent or obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect changes in underlying assumptions or factors, new information, future events, or other changes.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies\nThe Company's audited consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and follow general practices applicable to the banking industry. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. These estimates, assumptions, and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements. Certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. Estimates, assumptions, and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value, when a decline in the value of an asset warrants an impairment write-down or valuation reserve to be established, or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event. Carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility between reporting periods. The fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by third-party sources, when available. When third-party information is not available, valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management primarily through the use of internal cash flow modeling techniques.\nThe most significant accounting policies followed by the Company are presented in Note 1 of the Company's 2015 audited consolidated financial statements. These policies, along with the disclosures presented in other financial statement notes and in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined. Based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods, assumptions, and estimates underlying those amounts, management has identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses and fair value measurements to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments, and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses represents credit losses specifically identified in the loan portfolio, as well as management's estimate of probable incurred credit losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. Determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience, and consideration of current economic trends and conditions, all of which may be susceptible to significant changes. The loan portfolio also represents the largest asset group on the consolidated balance sheets. Additional information related to the allowance for loan losses that describes the methodology and risk factors can be found under the captions Asset Quality\u201d and Nonperforming Assets\u201d in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, as well as Notes 1 and 4 of the Company's 2015 audited consolidated financial statements.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe carrying value of certain financial assets and liabilities of the Company is impacted by the application of fair value measurements, either directly or indirectly. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In certain cases, an asset or liability is measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis, such as investment securities classified as available for sale and money market mutual funds. In other cases, management must rely on estimates or judgments to determine if an asset or liability not measured at fair value warrants an impairment write-down or whether a valuation reserve should be established.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of a financial instrument using a variety of valuation methods. Where financial instruments are actively traded and have quoted market prices, quoted market prices are used for fair value. Active markets are those where transaction volumes are sufficient to provide objective pricing information with reasonably narrow bid/ask spreads and where quoted prices do not vary widely. When the financial instruments are not actively traded, other observable market inputs such as quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics may be used, if available, to determine fair value. Inactive markets are characterized by low transaction volumes, price quotations that vary substantially among market participants, or in which minimal information is released publicly.\nWhen observable market prices do not exist, the Company estimates fair value primarily by using cash flow and other financial modeling methods. The valuation methods may also consider factors such as liquidity and concentration concerns. Other factors such as model assumptions, market dislocations, and unexpected correlations can affect estimates of fair value. Changes in these underlying factors, assumptions, or estimates in any of these areas could materially impact the amount of revenue or loss recorded.\nAdditional information regarding fair value measurements can be found in Notes 1 and 19 of the Company's 2015 audited consolidated financial statements. The following is a summary of the Company's more significant assets that may be affected by fair value measurements, as well as a brief description of the current accounting practices and valuation methodologies employed by the Company:\nAvailable For Sale Investment Securities and Money Market Mutual Funds\nInvestment securities classified as available for sale and money market mutual funds are measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis. These instruments are valued primarily by independent third party pricing services under the market valuation approach that include, but are not limited to, the following inputs:\n \u25cf Mutual funds and equity securities are priced utilizing real-time data feeds from active market exchanges for identical securities; and \n \u25cf Government-sponsored agency debt securities, obligations of states and political subdivisions, mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds, and other similar investment securities are priced with available market information through processes using benchmark yields, matrix pricing, prepayment speeds, cash flows, live trading data, and market spreads sourced from new issues, dealer quotes, and trade prices, among others sources. \nAt December 31, 2015, all of the Company's available for sale investment securities and money market mutual funds were measured using observable market data.\nOther Real Estate Owned\nOther real estate owned ( OREO\u201d) includes properties acquired by the Company through, or in lieu of, actual loan foreclosures and initially carried at fair value less estimated costs to sell. Fair value is generally based on third party appraisals of the property that includes comparable sales data. The carrying value of each OREO property is updated at least annually and more frequently when market conditions significantly impact the value of the property. If the carrying amount exceeds fair value less estimated costs to sell, an impairment loss is recorded through expense. OREO is subsequently accounted for at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs to sell. At December 31, 2015, OREO was $21.8 million compared to $32.0 million at year-end 2014.\nImpaired Loans\nLoans are considered impaired when it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impaired loans are measured at the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, at the loan's observable market price, or at the fair value of the collateral based on recent appraisals if the loan is collateral dependent. If the value of an impaired loan is less than the unpaid balance, the difference is credited to the allowance for loan losses with a corresponding charge to provision for loan losses. Loan losses are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan is confirmed.\nAppraisals used in connection with valuing collateral-dependent loans may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Appraisers take absorption rates into consideration and adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process to identify differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Such adjustments consist mainly of estimated costs to sell that are not included in certain appraisals or to update appraised collateral values as a result of market declines of similar properties for which a newer appraisal is available. These adjustments can be significant. Impaired loans were $37.2 million and $44.0 million at year-end 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nEXECUTIVE LEVEL OVERVIEW\nThe Company offers a variety of financial products and services at its 34 banking locations in 21 communities throughout Central and Northern Kentucky. The Company has four separately chartered commercial banks that operate under a community banking philosophy. This philosophy focuses primarily on understanding the banking needs of those in our local and surrounding communities and providing them with competitively priced products and a high level of personalized service. The most significant products and services the Company offers include consumer and business lending, checking, savings, and other deposit accounts, automated teller machines, electronic bill payments, and providing trust services and other traditional banking products and services. The primary goals of the Company are to continually improve profitability and shareholder value, increase and maintain a strong capital position, provide excellent service to our customers through our community banking structure, and to provide a challenging and rewarding work environment for our employees.\nThe Company generates a significant amount of its revenue, cash flows, and net income from interest income and net interest income. The ability to properly manage net interest income under changing market environments is crucial to the success of the Company. Managing credit risk also has a significant influence on the operating results of the Company. While the overall economy has largely improved since the recessionary period between 2007 and 2009 ( Recession\u201d), the Company continues to face an elevated level of nonperforming assets that built up following the Recession. The Company has focused a significant amount of effort to reduce its nonperforming assets over the last several years which has led to a substantial decline of nearly 60% when compared with its peak of $135 million during 2010. Nonperforming assets are at the lowest level since the first quarter of 2009.\nAs a result of increased business development efforts, the loan portfolio of the Company grew during 2015, the first year-over-year increase since 2008. Although end of period loan balances increased in the comparison, the Company continues its commitment to strong credit underwriting standards, which has at times hindered the opportunity to increase loans. Soft loan demand in the early to middle part of 2015 resulted in a decrease in the average loan balance of $35.2 million or 3.6% compared to a year earlier. Strengthened credit underwriting standards put in place since the Recession have resulted in steady improvement in the overall credit quality of the loan portfolio and a decrease to the allowance for loan losses.\nThe economic and business environment outlook for 2016 overall is positive, although individual indicators are mixed. In 2016, the Company intends to build on its recent loan growth and continue to reduce nonperforming assets. To further increase profitability, the Company will focus on increasing productivity and lowering operating costs. Since redeeming the final portion of its preferred stock during 2015, the Company is now considering additional alternatives as to the best use of its capital going forward to build shareholder value. In January 2016, the Company announced a dividend of $0.07 per common share and the early extinguishment of $15 million of debt. These two events reflect the initiatives of prudent use of capital and increasing shareholder value. The early extinguishment of debt resulted in a $4.1 million or $.36 per common share gain.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe Company reported net income of $15.0 million for 2015 a decrease of $1.5 million or 8.9% compared to $16.5 million for 2014. On a per common share basis, net income was $1.95 and $1.94 for 2015 and 2014, respectively. Per common share net income was positively impacted by the Company's redemption of its outstanding preferred shares, which decreased preferred dividends by $1.5 million in the comparison. The preferred share redemptions took place in three separate transactions of 10,000 shares each beginning in the second quarter of 2014 and concluding in June 2015. Selected income statement amounts and related information is presented in the table below.\n\nbp - basis points.\nThe more significant components related to the Company's results of operations are included below.\nInterest Income\nInterest income results from interest earned on earning assets, which primarily includes loans and investment securities. Interest income is affected by volume (average balance), the composition of earning assets, and the related rates earned on those assets. Total interest income for 2015 was $61.2 million, a decrease of $3.1 million or 4.8% compared to $64.4 million for 2014. The decrease in interest income was driven by lower interest from loans of $2.0 million or 4.0%, which was negatively impacted primarily by a decline in the average balance and, to a lesser degree, a lower average rate earned. Interest income on investment securities decreased $1.2 million or 8.1%, driven by a lower average rate earned.\nThe decrease in the average balance of loans has been accelerated by early payoffs primarily in the earlier part of 2015. The early payoffs relate to several larger balance credits that were refinanced by competitors with terms below the Company's underwriting standards. In recent years, the Company has focused on strengthening its credit underwriting standards, which has improved the overall credit quality of the loan portfolio. When high quality loan demand is low, available funds are redirected to lower yielding investment securities or cash equivalents or used to manage liquidity. The average interest rates on loans decreased three basis points during 2015, which is reflective of the sluggish economy, competitive factors, and the Company's ongoing strategy to be more selective in pricing both its loans and deposits.\nThe overall interest rate environment at year-end 2015, as measured by the Treasury yield curve, remains at very low levels when compared with historical trends. The yield curve flattened in the year-over-year comparison, particularly when comparing the two and ten-year maturity periods. The yields on shorter-term maturity periods, particularly six-month and two-year, increased more significantly than the yields related to longer periods such as the ten and thirty-year maturities. The six-month and two-year maturities increased 37 and 36 basis points, respectively, while yields on the ten and thirty-year maturities increased 8 and 26 basis points, respectively. At year-end 2015, the short-term federal funds interest rate target range was between 0.25% and 0.50%, which was increased during December 2015 from a target of zero to 0.25%. The Federal Reserve Board ( Federal Reserve\u201d) has indicated that it will continue to assess progress toward its objective of maximum employment and two percent inflation when determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target rate. At December 31, 2015, the national and Kentucky unemployment rates were 5.0% and 5.3%, respectively. At year-end 2015, the national inflation rate was 0.7% based on the Consumer Price Index published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense results from incurring interest on interest bearing liabilities, which are made up of interest bearing deposits, federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and other borrowed funds. Interest expense is affected by volume, composition of interest bearing liabilities, and the related rates paid on those liabilities. Total interest expense was $8.6 million for 2015, a decrease of $1.5 million or 14.9% compared to $10.2 million for 2014. The decrease in interest expense is attributed primarily to lower interest on deposits of $1.3 million or 30.4%. Both rate declines and lower volume contributed to the decrease, with a significant amount of the decrease related to time deposits. The Company has continued to aggressively reprice higher-rate maturing time deposits downward to lower market rates or to allow them to mature without renewal. Interest expense on long-term borrowings decreased $216 thousand or 3.7%, primarily due to a lower average balance of Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB\u201d) borrowings.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income is the most significant component of the Company's operating earnings. Net interest income is the excess of the interest income earned on earning assets over the interest paid for funds to support those assets. The two most common metrics used to analyze net interest income are net interest spread and net interest margin. Net interest spread represents the difference between the taxable equivalent yields on earning assets and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities. Net interest margin represents the percentage of taxable equivalent net interest income to average earning assets. Net interest margin will exceed net interest spread because of the existence of noninterest bearing sources of funds, principally demand deposits and shareholders' equity, which are also available to fund earning assets.\nChanges in net interest income and margin result from the interaction between the volume and composition of earning assets, their related yields, and the associated cost and composition of the interest bearing liabilities. Accordingly, portfolio size, composition, and the related yields earned and the average rates paid have a significant impact on net interest spread and margin. The table following this discussion represents the major components of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities on a tax equivalent basis. To compare the tax-exempt asset yields to taxable yields, amounts in the table are adjusted to pretax equivalents based on the marginal corporate Federal tax rate of 35%.\nTax equivalent net interest income was $54.3 million for 2015, a decrease of $1.6 million or 2.8% compared to $55.8 million for 2014. Net interest margin was 3.29% for 2015, a decrease of eight basis points from 3.37% for the prior year. The decrease in net interest margin was driven by a seven basis point decline in net interest spread, which was 3.14% for 2015 compared to 3.21% for 2014.\nThe Company actively monitors and proactively manages the rate sensitive components of both its assets and liabilities in a continuously changing and difficult market environment. Competition in the Company's market areas continues to be intense, and market interest rates remain very low by historical measures. The Federal Reserve increased the short-term federal funds target rate by a quarter percent in December 2015, the first change to this rate since December 2008, and has indicated that it expects only gradual adjustments in its stance on monetary policy.\nSimilar to the short-term federal funds target rate, the prime interest rate rose a quarter percent in December 2015. The Company uses the prime interest rate as part of its pricing model primarily on variable rate commercial real estate loans. The prime interest rate can have a significant impact on the Company's interest income from loans that reprice based on changes to this rate. The Company's variable interest rate loans contain provisions that limit the amount of increase or decrease in the interest rate during the life of a loan. This will limit the increase or decrease in interest income on loans that have interest rates tied to the prime interest rate. For 2015, the average yield earned on loans was 5.17%, which exceeded the prime interest rate of 3.50% at year-end. Predicting the direction and timing of future interest rates is uncertain.\nFor 2015, the average rate of the Company's two most significant components of net interest income, loans and time deposits, both declined. The average rate earned on the Company's loan portfolio for 2015 declined three basis points to 5.17% and the average rate paid on time deposits decreased 16 basis points to 0.64% compared to 2014. The Company expects its net interest margin to remain relatively flat in the near term based on internal modeling using expectations about future market interest rates, loan volume, the maturity structure of the Company's earning assets and liabilities, and other factors. Future results, however, could be significantly different than expectations.\nDistribution of Assets, Liabilities and Shareholders' Equity: Interest Rates and Interest Differential\n\n1Average yields on securities available for sale have been calculated based on amortized cost.\n2Income and yield stated at a fully tax equivalent basis using the marginal corporate Federal tax rate of 35%.\n3Loan balances include principal balances on nonaccrual loans.\n4Loan fees included in interest income amounted to $1.3 million for 2015, 2014, and 2013.\nThe following table is an analysis of the change in net interest income.\nAnalysis of Changes in Net Interest Income (tax equivalent basis)\n\n1The changes which are not solely due to rate or volume are allocated on a percentage basis using the absolute values of rate and volume variances as a basis for allocation.\n2Income stated at fully tax equivalent basis using the marginal corporate Federal tax rate of 35%.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe Company recorded a credit to the provision for loan losses in the amount of $3.4 million and $4.4 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of outstanding loans (net of unearned income) was 1.08% at December 31, 2015 compared to 1.50% at year-end 2014. The credit to the provision for loan losses is attributed to continued improvement in the credit quality of the loan portfolio. The decrease in the credit to the provision is mainly driven by growth of $27.3 million in the loan portfolio during 2015 compared to a decline of $67.9 million in loans outstanding during 2014. Further information about improvements in the Company's overall credit quality is included under the captions Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d and Nonperforming Loans\u201d that follows.\nNet charge-offs were $224 thousand and $2.2 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively, down $2.0 million or 90.0% in the comparison. Net charge-offs were 0.02% of average loans outstanding for 2015 compared to 0.23% for the prior year.\nNoninterest Income\nThe components of noninterest income are as follows for the periods indicated:\n\nNM - not meaningful.\nThe more significant items impacting noninterest income are included below.\n \u25cf Service charges and fees on deposits decreased primarily due to lower overdraft fees of $351 thousand or 7.7%, reflecting a decrease in volume attributed in part to overall trends in consumer behavior. All other services charges and fees on deposits increased $140 thousand or 4.3% net. \n \u25cf Allotment processing fees are down 13.8% in the comparison due to lower volume. The decrease in volume relates to the U.S. Department of Defense ( DOD\u201d) policy that became effective January 1, 2015, which restricts the types of purchases active service members are able to make using the military allotment system for payment. \n \u25cf The increase in other service charges, commissions, and fees is attributed primarily to higher interchange fees of $169 thousand or 5.7% due to higher debit card transaction volumes. The Company also received a nonrecurring fee of $63 thousand during 2015 related to credit card merchant activity. \n \u25cf The decrease in trust fees was driven by unusually large nonrecurring estate fees of $412 thousand during the last half of 2014, offset by nonrecurring fees of $131 thousand in the current year. Overall, trust assets at year-end 2015 were down $7.5 million or 1.2% from a year ago driven mainly by lower market values of managed assets. \n \u25cf The net loss on investment securities for in the prior year includes $95 thousand attributed to a municipal bond issuer participating in the Build America Bond ( BAB\u201d) program. The issuer exercised its extraordinary redemption privilege, which was triggered by Federal budget sequestration events. Since the carrying value of the bond exceeded the par value due to unamortized premium, the Company recorded a loss on this investment during 2014. The remaining unamortized premium of BAB investments at December 31, 2015 was $16 thousand, with the related carrying amount of the investments totaling $971 thousand. \n \u25cf Net gains on the sale of mortgage loans in the current quarter includes $131 thousand related to two larger-balance commercial mortgage loans with an aggregate balance of $12.3 million. The prior year includes a nonrecurring loss of $92 thousand, made up of a $46 thousand related to a group of loans reclassified from held for sale to held for investment and a group of loans sold for a loss of $46 thousand. The volume of loans sold in 2015 increased $10.9 million or 38.0% compared to 2014. \n \u25cf The decrease in income from company-owned life insurance was driven by a $276 thousand tax-free death benefit that exceeded the cash surrender value during the prior year. \n \u25cf The decrease in other income relates mainly to the Company's equity interest in its tax credit partnerships and to a nonrecurring receipt of $113 thousand during 2014 related to a legal settlement. The Company recorded income of $358 thousand related to these partnerships for 2014 and no income related to the partnerships during the current year. The cumulative share of losses related to the partnerships exceeds the amount invested, resulting in a carrying value of the partnerships of zero. \nNoninterest Expense\nThe components of noninterest expense are as follows for the periods indicated:\n\nThe more significant items impacting noninterest expenses are included below.\n \u25cf Salaries and employee benefits increased due to higher salary and related payroll taxes of $1.3 million or 5.5%, and an increase in benefits expenses of $911 thousand or 17.1%. The increase in salaries is due to both normal employee annual increases combined with discretionary bonuses in 2015 to certain key employees totaling $495 thousand, of which $231 thousand was paid in 2016. The increase in benefits expenses was driven mainly by claims activity related to the Company's self-funded health insurance plan and an increase in the actuary-determined benefit expenses related to postretirement medical costs. Postretirement benefit expenses increased mainly due to changes in actuary assumptions used to value the plan liability and expense, primarily the assumption related to the discount rate. The Company had 501 full time equivalent employees at year-end 2015, down from 510 a year earlier. \n \u25cf Occupancy expenses decreased mainly due to lower maintenance and utilities costs of $66 thousand or 8.9% and $65 thousand or 7.6%, respectively. Maintenance and utilities costs during 2014 were high due to several large expenses related to repairs. \n \u25cf Data processing and communication expense increased 6.7%. The increase is mainly due to higher costs related to technology updates in the normal course of business. \n \u25cf The decrease to deposit insurance expense for 2015 is primarily a result of the improved risk rating by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC\u201d) at the Company's bank subsidiaries. The improved ratings reduced the assessment rate used to determine the amount payable for deposit insurance. \n \u25cf Other real estate expenses decreased as a result of lower impairment charges of $1.5 million or 58.1%, lower development, operating, and maintenance expenses of $1.5 million or 78.1%, and lower net loss on property sales of $588 thousand or 75.8%. The decrease in development, operating, and maintenance expenses were primarily related to increasing the marketability of two real estate construction projects to better position them for sale during the prior year. The two properties were subsequently sold. \nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense was $5.3 million for 2015, a decrease of $806 thousand or 13.2% compared to $6.1 million for 2014. The effective income tax rates were 26.1% and 27.0% for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in income tax expense and the effective tax rate for 2015 is attributed primarily to lower pretax income, which was driven by a higher mix of tax-exempt versus taxable sources of revenue. The effective income tax rates are lower than the U.S. statutory federal rate of 35% primarily as a result of tax-exempt interest income from loans and investment securities, income from life insurance policies, and premium income associated with the Company's captive insurance subsidiary.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nTotal assets of the Company were $1.8 billion at year-end 2015, down $6.7 million or 0.4% compared with year-end 2014. The Company's overall financial condition continued to improve in the current year. The loan portfolio grew $27.3 million or 2.9% to $959 million during 2015, the first year-over-year increase since 2008. Total nonperforming assets were $54.1 million at year-end. While still elevated, nonperforming assets have declined $80.5 million or 59.8% from their peak of $135 million in the first quarter of 2010. Although net interest margin fell eight basis points to 3.29%, loan quality metrics continued to improve throughout the year. Regulatory capital levels remain significantly above the well-capitalized\u201d threshold, even after the redemption of the final portion of the Company's preferred stock in the amount of $10.0 million during the year.\nTemporary Investments\nTemporary investments consist of interest bearing deposits in other banks, federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell, and money market mutual funds. The Company uses these funds in the management of liquidity and interest rate sensitivity or as a short-term holding prior to subsequent movement into other investments with higher yields or for other purposes. At December 31, 2015, temporary investments were $92.1 million, an increase of $18.0 million or 24.2% compared to $74.1 million at year-end 2014.\nInvestment Securities\nThe investment securities portfolio is comprised primarily of residential mortgage-backed securities, tax-exempt securities of states and political subdivisions, and debt securities issued by U.S. government-sponsored agencies. Substantially all of the Company's investment securities are designated as available for sale. Total investment securities had a carrying amount of $586 million at year-end 2015, a decrease of $44.3 million or 7.0% compared to $630 million at year-end 2014. Proceeds received from maturing or called investment securities not needed to fund higher-earning loans are either reinvested in similar investments or used to manage liquidity, such as for deposit outflows or other payment obligations. The Company periodically sells investment securities in response to its overall asset/liability management strategy to lock in gains, increase yield, restructure expected future cash flows, and/or enhance its capital position.\nThe decrease in investment securities was driven by net maturities, calls, and sales of $145 million in the aggregate, which outpaced purchases totaling $110 million. The remainder of the decrease was due to $5.6 million of net premium amortization and a $3.0 million decrease in the market value adjustment related to securities classified as available for sale. The decrease in the value of the available for sale securities portfolio is attributed to a general shift downward in bond prices during the fourth quarter, primarily for the two- and three-year maturity periods. In general, as market interest rates increase, the value of fixed rate investments decrease.\nAt year-end 2015, investment securities included $5.9 million amortized cost amounts of single-issuer trust preferred capital securities of a U.S. based global financial services firm with an estimated fair value of $5.1 million, down from $5.5 million at year-end 2014. The investment continues to perform according to contractual terms and is rated as investment grade by major rating agencies. The issuer of the securities announced in the first quarter of 2015 an increase in per share common dividend payments and authorization of a common equity repurchase plan. The Company does not intend to sell its investment in these securities, nor does the Company believe it is likely that it will be required to sell these securities prior to their anticipated recovery. The Company believes these securities are not impaired due to reasons of credit quality or other factors, but rather the unrealized loss is primarily attributed to continuing uncertainties in both international and domestic economies and market volatility. The Company believes that it will collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of these securities and that the fair values of these securities will recover as they approach their maturity dates.\nThe Company attributes the unrealized losses in other sectors of the investment securities portfolio to changes in market interest rates and volatility, and thus identifies them as temporary. As discussed further above, market interest rates generally increased throughout 2015. Investment securities with an unrealized loss at December 31, 2015 are performing according to their contractual terms, and the Company does not expect to incur a loss on these securities unless they are sold prior to maturity. The Company does not have the intent to sell these securities nor does it believe it is likely that it will be required to sell these securities prior to their anticipated recovery. The Company does not consider any of the securities to be impaired due to reasons of credit quality or other factors. All investment securities in the Company's portfolio are currently performing.\nFunds made available from sold, matured, or called bonds are redirected to fund higher yielding loan growth when available, reinvested to purchase additional investment securities, or otherwise employed to improve the composition of the balance sheet and liquidity. The purchase of nontaxable obligations of states and political subdivisions is one of the primary means of managing the Company's tax position. The impact of the alternative minimum tax related to the Company's ability to acquire tax-free obligations at an attractive yield is routinely monitored. The Company does not have direct exposure to the subprime mortgage market. The Company does not originate subprime mortgages nor has it invested in bonds that are secured by such mortgages.\nThe following table summarizes the carrying values of investment securities on December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013. The investment securities are divided into available for sale and held to maturity securities. Available for sale securities are carried at estimated fair value and held to maturity securities are carried at amortized cost. Corporate debt securities consist primarily of debt issued by a large global financial services firm. Mutual funds and equity securities are attributed to the Company's captive insurance subsidiary.\n\nThe following table presents an analysis of the contractual maturity and tax equivalent weighted average interest rates of investment securities at December 31, 2015. Available for sale securities are stated at estimated fair value and held to maturity securities are stated at amortized cost. Mortgage-backed securities are included in maturity categories based on their stated maturity dates. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations. Mutual funds and equity securities have no stated maturity date and are not included in the maturity schedule that follows.\nAvailable for Sale\n\nHeld to Maturity\n\nThe calculation of the weighted average interest rates for each category is based on the weighted average amortized cost of the securities. The weighted average tax rates on exempt state and political subdivisions are computed based on the marginal corporate Federal tax rate of 35%.\nLoans\nLoans, net of unearned income, were $959 million at December 31, 2015, an increase of $27.3 million or 2.9% compared to year-end 2014. The loan portfolio grew during the last three quarters of 2015, with three larger-balance commercial real estate loans totaling $26.1 million in the aggregate driving the increase in the fourth quarter. The Company continues a measured and cautious approach to loan originations while working to further reduce its level of nonperforming assets as economic growth remains slow. Generating high quality loans continues to be a challenge, and the increase in outstanding loans occurred despite early payoffs of several larger balance credits. These early payoffs were primarily the result of several larger credits that were refinanced by competitors, many of which were with terms below the Company's underwriting standards. Loan payments include $4.5 million related to nonaccrual loans and $3.9 million related to performing restructured loans.\nFrom time to time the Company may purchase a limited amount of loans originated by otherwise nonaffiliated third parties. The Company performs its own risk assessment and makes the credit decision on each loan prior to purchase. The Company purchased smaller balance commercial loans totaling $8.3 million and $3.8 million in the aggregate during 2015 and 2014, respectively. The average amount of the purchased loans was $115 thousand for 2015 and $80 thousand for 2014.\nThe composition of the loan portfolio is summarized in the table that follows. Based on economic forecasts and other available information, the Company expects continued gradual improvements to the local and regional economy during the coming year. An improving economy, particularly where the labor force participation rates increase, could lead to continued growth in the loan portfolio.\n\nOn an average basis, loans represented 56.6% of earning assets for 2015, a decrease of 183 basis points compared to 58.5% for 2014. As loan demand changes, available funds are reallocated between temporary investments or investment securities, which typically involve a decrease in credit risk and result in lower yields. The Company does not have direct exposure to the subprime mortgage market. The Company does not originate subprime mortgages nor has it invested in bonds that are secured by such mortgages. Subprime mortgage lending is defined by the Company generally as lending to a borrower that would not qualify for a mortgage loan at prevailing market rates or whereby the underwriting decision is based on limited or no documentation of the ability to repay.\nThe following table presents the amount of commercial, financial, and agricultural loans and loans secured by real estate outstanding at December 31, 2015 which, based on remaining scheduled repayments of principal, are due in the periods indicated.\nLoan Maturities\n\nThe table below presents the amount of commercial, financial, and agricultural loans and loans secured by real estate outstanding at December 31, 2015 that are due after one year, classified according to sensitivity to changes in interest rates.\nInterest Sensitivity\n\nAsset Quality\nThe Company's loan portfolio is subject to varying degrees of credit risk. Credit risk is mitigated by diversification within the portfolio, limiting exposure to any single customer or industry, rigorous lending policies and underwriting criteria, and collateral requirements. The Company maintains policies and procedures to ensure that the granting of credit is done in a sound and consistent manner. This includes policies on a company-wide basis that require certain minimum standards to be maintained by its subsidiary banks. However, the policies also permit the subsidiary companies authority to adopt standards that are no less stringent than those included in the company-wide policies. Credit decisions are made at the subsidiary bank level under guidelines established by policy. The Company's internal audit department performs loan reviews at each subsidiary bank during the year. This review evaluates loan administration, credit quality, documentation, compliance with Company loan standards, and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a consolidated and subsidiary basis.\nThe provision for loan losses represents charges or credits made to earnings to maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level considered adequate to provide for probable incurred credit losses at the balance sheet date. The allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance increased by the provision for loan losses and decreased by net charge-offs. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance.\nThe allowance for loan losses and related provision for loan losses generally fluctuate relative to the level of nonperforming and impaired loans, but other factors impact the amount of the allowance. The Company estimates the adequacy of the allowance using a risk-rated methodology based on the Company's past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral securing loans, composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions, and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates that may be susceptible to change.\nThe allowance for loan losses consists of specific and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired. The general component covers non-impaired loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current risk factors. Allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans, but the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in management's judgment, should be charged off. Actual loan losses could differ significantly from the amounts estimated by management.\nThe Company's risk-rated methodology includes segregating non-impaired watch list and past due loans from the general portfolio and allocating a loss percentage to these loans depending on their status. For example, watch list loans, which may be identified by the internal loan review risk-rating process or by regulatory examiner classification, are assigned a certain loss percentage while loans past due 30 days or more are assigned a separate loss percentage. Each of these loss rates considers past experience as well as current factors. The remainder of the general loan portfolio is segregated into portfolio segments having similar risk characteristics identified as follows: real estate loans, commercial loans, and consumer loans. Each of these portfolio segments is assigned a loss percentage based on their respective sixteen quarter rolling historical loss rates, adjusted for qualitative risk factors.\nThe qualitative risk factors used in the methodology are consistent with the guidance in the most recent Interagency Policy Statement on the Allowance for Loan Losses issued. Each factor is supported by a detailed analysis performed at each subsidiary bank and is both measureable and supportable. Some factors include a minimum allocation in some instances where loss levels are extremely low and it is determined to be prudent from a safety and soundness perspective. Qualitative risk factors that are used in the methodology include the following for each loan portfolio segment:\n\nA loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Loans for which the terms have been modified resulting in a concession, and for which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties, are considered troubled debt restructurings and classified as impaired. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower's prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed.\nWhile the overall economy experienced further improvement in 2015, the Company continued its steady progress in reducing its level of nonperforming assets. The Recession resulted in an accumulation of nonperforming assets, and significant deterioration in the Company's credit quality and collateral values, primarily in residential real estate lending. Credit quality has improved significantly over the last few years, as loan underwriting standards have been strengthened and nonperforming asset levels have declined nearly 60% from the peak that occurred in 2010. Although overall economic growth remains slow, the key economic measures have largely recovered from the Recession. In Kentucky, housing starts continue to gradually increase and foreclosure rates are at the lowest rate since 2007. At year-end 2015, the national and Kentucky unemployment rate was 5.0% and 5.3%, respectively. Unemployment rates have improved significantly from a year ago, but labor force participation rates remain near 30-year lows.\nWith the continued improvement in the credit quality of the loan portfolio, the level of nonperforming assets are at the lowest level since the first quarter of 2009. Nonperforming loans were $32.2 million at year-end, a decrease of $3.7 million for the year and $75.7 million or 70.1% since peaking at $108 million in the first quarter of 2010. The Company includes accruing restructured loans as a component of its nonperforming loans. Such loans were $23.8 million at year-end 2015 and account for 74.0% of nonperforming loans. Of the $23.8 million in accruing restructured loans, $22.2 million consist of three larger-balance credit relationships secured by various types of real estate collateral. Nonaccrual loans were $8.4 million at year-end 2015, down $3.1 million or 27.2% for the year. Nonperforming assets as a percent of total assets fell eight basis points to 3.0%. High levels of nonperforming assets generally result in loan charge-offs, provisions for loan losses, and impairment charges on repossessed real estate. The Company works with its loan customers on an individual case-by-case basis in order to maximize loan repayments on its challenged credits and typically does not restructure those that are past due.\nImpaired loans are those in which the Company does not expect to receive full payment under the contractual terms. Impaired loans are measured at the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, at the loan's observable market price, or at the fair value of the collateral taking into consideration estimated costs to sell if the loan is collateral dependent. Collateral values are updated in accordance with policy guidelines by obtaining independent third party appraisals and monitoring sales activity of similar properties in our market area.\nAt year-end 2015, the Company had $2.9 million in specific reserves allocated to impaired loans. Of this total, $1.2 million or 41.1% is attributed to a group of loans to a single creditor totaling $7.3 million secured by a combination of a real estate development and residential real estate properties. This group of collateral dependent loans is classified as performing restructured loans at year-end 2015.\nThe Company recorded a credit to the provision for loan losses of $3.4 million in 2015, or $935 thousand lower than the $4.4 million recorded in 2014. The decreased credit is due to loan portfolio growth of $27.3 million or 2.9% during 2015 compared to a decline of $67.9 million or 6.8% during 2014. Historical loss rates, adjusted for current risk factors, have improved due to lower recent charge-off activity that has replaced higher levels that had been included in the early part of the Company's look-back period used in its allowance for loan losses methodology. The decrease in historical loss rates and charge-off activity is due primarily to stabilizing real estate values, which serves as collateral for nearly 90% of the Company's loan portfolio. The rapid declines in real estate values experienced beginning in 2008 and continuing through 2011 have leveled off significantly, and the allowance for loan losses reflects this improvement. The Company has also implemented stronger credit underwriting standards in recent years, which has improved overall credit quality measures.\nWhile historical loss rates may continue improving in the near term due to elevated charge-offs falling out of the look-back period, this improvement may not necessarily correlate to a lower provision for loan losses. Other qualitative factors, such as changes in loan volume, the overall makeup of the portfolio, economic conditions, and other risk factors applied to historical loss rates may offset to some degree the impact of decreases to the historical loss rates. Certain credit quality measures are summarized in the table that follows for the periods indicated. Several of these measures are at the best level in the last three years.\n\n1Based on quarter-end balances over the previous three years.\nNet charge-offs were $224 thousand for 2015, a decrease of $2.0 million or 90.0% compared to 2014. Net charge-offs were 0.02% of average loans outstanding for 2015 compared to 0.23% for the prior year. Net charge-offs for the current and prior year are each well below the $14.2 million peak which occurred in the early part of the post-recession period of 2009. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of outstanding loans was 1.08% and 1.50% at year-end 2015 and 2014, respectively. As a percentage of nonperforming loans, the allowance for loan losses was 32.0% and 38.9% at year-end 2015 and 2014, respectively. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonaccrual loans was 123% and 121% at year-end 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nThe relatively low amount of the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans is due mainly to the makeup of nonperforming loans, where performing restructured loans represent 74.0% of total nonperforming loans outstanding at year-end 2015. The allowance attributed to credits that are restructured with lower interest rates generally represents the difference in the present value of future cash flows calculated at the loan's original effective interest rate and the new lower rate. This typically results in a reserve for loan losses that is less severe than for other loans that are collateral dependent. The allowance specifically allocated to impaired loans was $2.9 million or 7.9% of such loans at year-end 2015 compared with $3.4 million or 7.7% a year earlier.\nThe table below summarizes the loan loss experience for the past five years.\nAllowance For Loan Losses\n\nThe following table presents an estimate of the allocation of the allowance for loan losses by type for the dates indicated. Although specific allocations exist, the entire allowance is available to absorb losses in any particular category.\n\nAdditional information concerning the Company's asset quality is presented under the caption Nonperforming Assets\u201d which follows and Investment Securities\u201d beginning on page 49.\nNonperforming Assets\nThe Company's nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans, OREO, and other foreclosed assets. Nonperforming loans include nonaccrual loans, performing restructured loans, and loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest. Nonaccrual loans are considered to be an indicator of potential losses. The accrual of interest on loans is discontinued when it is determined that the collection of interest or principal is doubtful, or when a default of interest or principal has existed for 90 days or more, unless such loan is well secured and in the process of collection. Restructured loans occur when a lender, because of economic or legal reasons related to a borrower's financial difficulty, grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. Restructured loans typically include a reduction of the stated interest rate or an extension of the maturity date. The Company gives careful consideration to identifying which of its challenged credits merit a restructuring of terms that it believes will result in maximum loan repayments and mitigate possible losses. Cash flow projections are carefully scrutinized prior to restructuring any credits; past due credits are typically not granted concessions.\nNonperforming assets were $54.1 million at year-end 2015, a decrease of $13.9 million or 20.4% compared to $67.9 million at year-end 2014. Such assets have been reduced to the lowest level since peaking at $135 million in the first quarter of 2010. Nonperforming assets increased sharply during 2009 mainly as a result of prolonged weaknesses in the overall economy.\nNonperforming assets by category are presented in the table below for the dates indicated.\n\nAdditional details related to nonperforming loans were as follows at year-end 2015 and 2014:\nNonperforming Loans\n\nNonperforming loan activity during 2015 was as follows:\n\nThe Company gives careful consideration to identifying which of its challenged credits merit a restructuring of terms that it believes will result in maximum loan repayments and mitigate possible losses. From time to time the Company may modify a customer's loan, but such modifications may or may not meet the criteria for classification as a restructured troubled debt. Modifications that do not meet the criteria of a troubled debt include:\n \u25cf repricing a loan to a current market rate of interest to a borrower with good credit and adequate collateral value in order to retain the customer; \n \u25cf changing the payment frequency from monthly to quarterly, semi-annually, or annually where the loan is performing, the borrower has good credit and adequate collateral value, and the Company believes valid reasons exist for the change; or \n \u25cf extending the interest only payment period of a performing loan where the borrower has good credit and adequate collateral value in instances where a project may still be in a phase of development or leasing-up, and where the Company believes completion will occur in the near future, or such extension is otherwise in the Company's best interest. \nAs modifications are made, management evaluates whether the modification meets the criteria to be classified as a troubled debt. These criteria include two components:\n 1. The bank makes a concession on the loan terms that it would not otherwise consider, and \n 2. The borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. \nThe Company's loan policy provides guidance to its lending personnel regarding restructured loans to ensure those that are troubled debt are properly identified. Additional attention is given to restructured loans through the oversight of the Chief Credit Officer at the Parent Company to ensure that modifications meeting criteria for restructured loans are identified and properly reported.\nThe table below sets forth on an aggregate basis at December 31, 2015, the types of non-troubled debt restructurings by loan type, number of loans, average loan balance and modification type:\n\nIn each of the modifications identified in the table above, management determined the loan was not in troubled condition due to the financial condition of the borrower and related collateral.\nThe Company has not engaged in loan splitting. Loan splitting is a practice that may occur in work-out situations whereby a loan is divided into two parts - a performing part and a nonperforming part. This benefits a lender by potentially replacing one impaired loan by one smaller good loan and one smaller bad loan. Overall charge-offs and reserve amounts are potentially reduced and the effects of adverse loan classifications may be diminished.\nThe Company's comprehensive risk-grading and loan review program includes a review of loans to assess risk and assign a grade to those loans, a review of delinquencies, and an assessment of loans for needed charge-offs or placement on nonaccrual status. The Company had loans in the amount of $54.2 million and $64.7 million at year-end 2015 and year-end 2014, respectively, which were performing but considered potential problem loans and are not included in the nonperforming loan totals in the tables above. These loans, however, are considered in establishing an appropriate allowance for loan losses. The balance outstanding for potential problem credits is mainly a result of lingering weaknesses in the overall economy that continue to strain some of the Company's customers. Potential problem loans include a variety of borrowers and are secured primarily by various types of real estate including commercial, construction properties, and residential real estate developments. The $10.5 million or 16.2% decrease during the year in the level of potential problem loans is attributed primarily to an overall improvement in credit quality similar to that of the overall portfolio. At December 31, 2015, the five largest potential problem credits were $12.3 million in the aggregate compared to $13.9 million at year-end 2014.\nPotential problem loans are identified on the Company's watch list and consist of loans that require close monitoring by management. Credits may be considered as a potential problem loan for reasons that are temporary or correctable, such as for a deficiency in loan documentation or absence of current financial statements of the borrower. Potential problem loans may also include credits where adverse circumstances are identified that may affect the borrower's ability to comply with the contractual terms of the loan. Other factors which might indicate the existence of a potential problem loan include the delinquency of a scheduled loan payment, deterioration in a borrower's financial condition identified in a review of periodic financial statements, a decrease in the value of the collateral securing the loan, or a change in the economic environment in which the borrower operates. Certain loans on the Company's watch list are also considered impaired and specific allowances related to these loans are established in accordance with the appropriate accounting guidance.\nOther real estate owned includes real estate properties acquired by the Company through, or in lieu of, actual loan foreclosures. At year-end 2015, OREO was $21.8 million, a decrease of $10.1 million or 31.7% compared to $32.0 million at year-end 2014. OREO has declined $30.7 million or 58.4% from its peak of $52.6 million, which occurred at year-end 2012.\nOREO activity for 2015 was as follows:\n\nThe reduction in OREO was driven by property sales and impairment charges of $10.5 million and $1.1 million, respectively, which more than offset new acquisitions. Six larger-balance properties with a carrying value of $6.7 million in the aggregate were sold during 2015. This includes three larger-balance residential real estate development properties that sold for $3.5 million in total with a net loss of $75 thousand, and three larger-balance commercial real estate properties sold for $3.1 million in total with a net loss of $123 thousand. The Company's had two OREO properties at year-end 2015 with a carrying amount in excess of $2.0 million each: one commercial real estate property of $2.6 million, and one commercial rental real estate property of $2.6 million.\nDeposits\nThe Company's primary source of funding for its lending and investment activities results from its customer deposits, which consist of noninterest and interest bearing demand, savings, and time deposits. A summary of the Company's deposits is presented in the table that follows. The decrease in time deposits is a result of the Company's high liquidity position and from its strategy to lower overall funding costs, mainly by allowing higher-rate certificates of deposit to roll off or reprice at significantly lower interest rates. Many of those balances have been moved into interest or noninterest bearing demand accounts or savings accounts by the customer. As rates have decreased throughout the deposit portfolio, many customers have opted to transfer funds from maturing time deposits or investments from other sources into short-term demand or savings accounts. The Company has not sought out or accepted brokered deposits in the past nor does it have plans to do so in the future.\nA summary of the Company's deposits is as follows for the dates indicated:\n\nA summary of average balances for deposits by type and the related weighted average rates paid is as follows for the periods presented:\n\nMaturities of time deposits of $100,000 or more outstanding at December 31, 2015 are summarized as follows:\n\nShort-term Borrowings\nShort-term borrowings include funding sources with an original maturity of one year or less. The Company's short-term borrowings consist of federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, which are generally on an overnight basis. Short-term borrowings primarily represent funds that have been swept out of the deposit accounts of certain qualifying commercial customers into repurchase agreements and accounted for as secured borrowings. A summary of short-term borrowings is as follows:\n\nLong-term Borrowings\nLong-term borrowings include funding sources with an original maturity greater than one year. The Company's long-term borrowings are comprised of securities sold under agreements to repurchase, FHLB advances, and subordinated notes payable to unconsolidated trusts. Long-term securities sold under agreements to repurchase primarily represent obligations related to the Company's balance sheet leverage transaction that originated in 2007. In this transaction, the Company borrowed $200 million through multiple fixed rate repurchase agreements and used the proceeds to purchase fixed rate Government National Mortgage Association ( GNMA\u201d) bonds that are pledged as collateral. The Company is required to secure the borrowed funds with GNMA bonds valued at 106% of the outstanding principal balance of the borrowings. Principal payments have reduced the outstanding balance of the obligation to $100 million at year-end 2015, with a weighted average interest rate of 3.95%. These borrowings are callable quarterly and mature in November 2017.\nThe Company has $1.5 million of other long-term repurchase agreements outstanding at year-end 2015 made in the ordinary course of business with commercial customers. These borrowings have a weighted average fixed rate of 0.88% with portions maturing in each subsequent year through 2019.\nFHLB advances to the Company's subsidiary banks are secured by restricted holdings of FHLB stock which participating banks are required to own as well as certain mortgage loans as required by the FHLB. FHLB advances are made pursuant to several different credit programs, which have their own interest rates and range of maturities. Interest rates on FHLB advances are fixed and range between 2.99% and 5.81%, with a weighted average rate of 3.98%. Remaining maturities of FHLB advances extend over multiple time periods through 2020, with a weighted average remaining term of 1.8 years. FHLB advances are generally used to increase the Company's lending activities and to aid the efforts of asset and liability management by utilizing various repayment options offered by the FHLB. Long-term advances from the FHLB totaled $18.8 million and $19.0 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. This represents a decrease of $155 thousand or 0.8% and is attributed to scheduled repayment activity. The Company has not initiated any long-term FHLB borrowings since 2008.\nIn 2005 and 2007, the Company completed a total of three private offerings of trust preferred securities through separate Delaware statutory trusts (the Trusts\u201d) sponsored by the Company in the aggregate amount of $47.5 million. The combined $25.0 million proceeds from the first two trusts ( Trusts I and II\u201d) established in 2005 were used to fund the acquisition of Citizens Bancorp. Proceeds from the third trust ( Trust III\u201d) were used primarily to acquire Company shares through a tender offer during 2007. The Company owns all of the common securities of each of the three Trusts. Subsequent to year-end 2015, the Company terminated Trust II as a result of the early extinguishment of debt issued to the trust. Refer to Note 24 of the Company's 2015 audited consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nThe Trusts used the proceeds from the sale of preferred securities, plus capital of $1.5 million contributed by the Company to establish the trusts, to purchase the Company's subordinated notes in amounts and bearing terms that parallel the amounts and terms of the respective preferred securities. Amounts and general terms related to the Trusts at year-end 2015 are summarized in the table below.\n\nThe subordinated notes of the Trusts are redeemable in whole or in part, without penalty, at the Company's option and are junior in right of payment of all present and future senior indebtedness of the Company. The weighted average interest rate in effect as of the last determination date in 2015 and 2014 was 1.94% and 1.71%, respectively.\nContractual Obligations\nThe Company's contractual obligations to make future payments as of December 31, 2015 are as follows:\n\nLong-term FHLB debt represents FHLB advances pursuant to several different credit programs. Long-term FHLB debt, subordinated notes payable, and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are more fully described under the caption Long-term Borrowings\u201d above and in Note 9 of the Company's 2015 audited consolidated financial statements. Payments for borrowings in the table above do not include interest. Postretirement benefit obligations are determined by actuaries and estimated based on various assumptions with payouts projected over the next ten years. Estimates can vary significantly each year due to changes in significant assumptions. Operating leases include standard business equipment used in the Company's day-to-day business as well as the lease of certain branch sites. Operating lease terms generally range from one to five years, with the ability to extend certain branch site leases at the Company's option. Payments related to leases are based on actual payments specified in the contracts. Employment agreements represent annual minimum base salary amounts payable by the Company to six employees. The Company has employment agreements with its Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and three key officers of its subsidiaries.\nGuarantees\nDuring 2007, the Parent Company entered into a guarantee agreement whereby it agreed to become unconditionally and irrevocably the guarantor of the obligations of three of its subsidiary banks in connection with the $200 million balance sheet leverage transaction. Principal payments by the bank subsidiaries have reduced the outstanding balance of the obligation to $100 million at year-end 2015, which matures in 2017. The borrowings are required to be secured by GNMA bonds valued at 106% of the amount outstanding, although the banks typically maintain an amount in excess of the required minimum. Should any of the subsidiary banks default on its borrowings under the agreement, the GNMA bonds securing the borrowings would be liquidated to satisfy amounts due. If the value of the GNMA bonds fall below the obligation under the contract, the Parent Company is obligated to cover any such shortfall in absence of the subsidiary banks' ability to do so. The Parent Company believes its subsidiary banks are fully capable of fulfilling their obligations under the borrowing arrangement and that the Parent Company will not be required to make any payments under the guarantee agreement.\nEffects of Inflation\nThe majority of the Company's assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. Therefore, the Company differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in nonmonetary assets, such as fixed assets and inventories. However, inflation does have an important impact on the growth of assets in the banking industry and on the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio. Inflation also affects other noninterest expense, which tends to rise during periods of general inflation.\nMarket Risk Management\nMarket risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates. The Company's market risk is comprised primarily of interest rate risk created by its core banking activities of extending loans and receiving deposits. The Company's success is largely dependent upon its ability to manage this risk. Interest rate risk is defined as the exposure of the Company's net interest income to adverse movements in interest rates. Although the Company manages other risks, such as credit and liquidity risk, management considers interest rate risk to be its most significant risk, which could potentially have the largest and a material effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. A sudden and substantial change in interest rates may adversely impact the Company's earnings to the extent that the interest rates earned on assets and paid on liabilities do not change at the same speed, to the same extent, or on the same basis. Other events that could have an adverse impact on the Company's performance include changes in general economic and financial conditions, general movements in market interest rates, and changes in consumer preferences. The Company's primary purpose in managing interest rate risk is to effectively invest the Company's capital and to manage and preserve the value created by its core banking business.\nManagement believes the most significant impact on financial and operating results is the Company's ability to react to changes in interest rates. Management seeks to maintain an essentially balanced position between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against the effects of wide interest rate fluctuations.\nThe Parent Company and each of its subsidiary banks has a Corporate Asset and Liability Management Committee ( ALCO\u201d) which monitors the composition of the balance sheet to ensure comprehensive management of interest rate risk and liquidity. The Parent Company ALCO also provides guidance and support to each ALCO of the Company's subsidiary banks and is responsible for monitoring risks on a company-wide basis. The Parent Company ALCO has established minimum standards in its asset and liability management policy that each subsidiary bank must adopt. However, the subsidiary banks are permitted to deviate from these standards so long as the deviation is no less stringent than that of the Corporate policy.\nThe Company uses a simulation model as a tool to monitor and evaluate interest rate risk exposure. The model is designed to measure the sensitivity of net interest income and net income to changing interest rates over future periods. Forecasting net interest income and its sensitivity to changes in interest rates requires the Company to make assumptions about the volume and characteristics of many attributes, including assumptions relating to the replacement of maturing earning assets and liabilities. Other assumptions include, but are not limited to, projected prepayments, projected new volume, and the predicted relationship between changes in market interest rates and changes in customer account balances. These effects are combined with the Company's estimate of the most likely rate environment to produce a forecast for the next twelve months. The forecasted results are then compared to the effect of a gradual 200 basis point increase and decrease in market interest rates on the Company's net interest income and net income. Because assumptions are inherently uncertain, the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income and net income or the effect of interest rate changes on net interest income and net income. Actual results could differ significantly from simulated results.\nAt December 31, 2015, the model indicated that if rates were to gradually increase by 200 basis points over the next twelve months, then net interest income (TE) and net income would decrease 0.33% and 0.96%, respectively, compared to forecasted results. The model indicated that if rates were to gradually decrease by 200 basis points over the next twelve months, then net interest income (TE) and net income would decrease 1.91% and 5.81%, respectively, compared to forecasted results.\nIn the current low interest rate environment, it is not practical or possible to reduce certain deposit rates by the same magnitude as rates on earning assets. The average rate paid on the Company's deposits is already below 2%. This situation magnifies the model's predicted results when modeling a decrease in interest rates, as earning assets with higher yields have more of an opportunity to reprice at lower rates than lower-rate deposits.\nLIQUIDITY\nLiquidity measures the ability to meet current and future cash flow needs as they become due. For financial institutions, liquidity reflects the capacity to meet loan demand, accommodate possible outflows in deposits, and to react and capitalize on interest rate market opportunities. A financial institution's ability to meet its current financial obligations is dependent upon the structure of its balance sheet, its ability to liquidate assets, and its access to alternative sources of funds. The Company's goal is to meet its near-term funding needs by maintaining a level of liquid funds through its asset/liability management. For the longer term, the liquidity position is managed by balancing the maturity structure of the balance sheet. This process allows for an orderly flow of funds over an extended period of time. The Company's ALCOs, both at the bank subsidiary and consolidated level, meet regularly and monitor the composition of the balance sheet to ensure comprehensive management of interest rate risk and liquidity.\nThe Company's objective as it relates to liquidity is to ensure that its subsidiary banks have funds available to meet deposit withdrawals and credit demands without unduly penalizing profitability. In order to maintain a proper level of liquidity, the subsidiary banks have several sources of funds available on a daily basis. For assets, those sources of funds include liquid assets that are readily marketable or that can be pledged, or which mature in the near future. These assets primarily include cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, investment securities, and cash flow generated by the repayment of principal and interest on loans and investment securities. For liabilities, sources of funds primarily include the subsidiary banks' core deposits, FHLB and other borrowings, and federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and investment securities are generally a predictable source of funds, deposit outflows and mortgage prepayments are influenced significantly by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition in our local markets.\nThe Company uses a liquidity ratio metric to help measure its ability to meet its cash flow needs. This ratio is monitored by ALCO at both the bank and consolidated level. The liquidity ratio is based on current and projected levels of sources and uses of funds. This measure is useful in analyzing cash needs and formulating strategies to achieve desired results. For example, a low liquidity ratio could indicate that the Company's ability to fund loans might become more difficult. A high liquidity ratio could indicate that the Company may have a disproportionate amount of funds in low yielding assets, which is more likely to occur during periods of sluggish loan demand or economic difficulties. The Company's liquidity position, as measured by its liquidity ratio, decreased at year-end 2015 when compared to year-end 2014, but is within its ALCO guidelines. The Company's liquidity ratio remains elevated mainly as a result of its overall net funding position and weak, quality loan demand. The Company continues a cautious lending strategy while continuing efforts to reduce its level of nonperforming assets in a slow growing economic environment.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company had $236 million of additional borrowing capacity under various FHLB, federal funds, and other agreements. However, there is no guarantee that these sources of funds will continue to be available to the Company, or that current borrowings can be refinanced upon maturity, although the Company is not aware of any events or uncertainties that are likely to cause a decrease in the Company's liquidity from these sources.\nLiquidity at the Parent Company level is primarily affected by the receipt of dividends from its subsidiary banks, cash balances maintained, and borrowings from nonaffiliated sources. Payment of dividends by the Company's subsidiary banks is subject to certain regulatory restrictions as set forth in national and state banking laws and regulations. Capital ratios at all four of the Company's subsidiary banks exceed regulatory established well-capitalized\u201d status at December 31, 2015 under the prompt corrective action regulatory framework.\nThe Parent Company's primary uses of cash include the payment of dividends to its preferred and common shareholders, injecting capital into subsidiaries, paying interest expense on borrowings, and payments for general operating expenses. The Company redeemed 20,000 shares, or two-thirds, of its original amount of outstanding preferred stock during 2014 in two separate partial redemptions of 10,000 shares each and redeemed the remaining 10,000 shares of preferred stock during the second quarter of 2015.\nThe Parent Company had cash balances of $36.0 million at year-end 2015, an increase of $3.9 million or 12.1% compared to $32.1 million at year-end 2014. Significant cash receipts of the Parent Company for 2015 include dividend payments from its bank subsidiaries of $14.4 million, a return of capital from nonbank subsidiaries in the amount of $1.4 million, and management fees from subsidiaries of $2.5 million. Significant cash payments by the Parent Company in 2015 include $10.0 million to redeem the final portion of its outstanding preferred stock, $3.0 million for salaries, payroll taxes, and employee benefits, $862 thousand for interest on trust preferred borrowings, and $508 thousand for the payment of dividends on its previously outstanding preferred stock.\nLiquid assets consist of cash and cash equivalents and available for sale investment securities. At December 31, 2015, consolidated liquid assets were $703 million, a decrease of $24.6 million or 3.4% from year-end 2014. The decrease in liquid assets was driven by lower available for sale investment securities of $44.2 million or 7.1%, offset by higher money market mutual funds of $11.0 million and higher interest bearing deposits with other banks in the amount of $7.6 million or 11.3%. Although liquid assets decreased in the comparison, liquid assets remain elevated mainly as a result of the Company's overall net funding position and weak, high-quality loan demand. The overall funding position of the Company changes as loan demand, deposit levels, and other sources and uses of funds fluctuate.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $25.9 million and $29.0 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively. This represents a decrease of $3.1 million or 10.6%, led by a decrease in net mortgage loans sold and a lower net loss on the sale and write downs of OREO. Net cash flow from investing activities was $15.9 million for 2015 and $57.3 million for 2014. This represents a decrease of $41.4 million or 72.3%, driven by loan activity, partially offset by net investment securities. For loans, the Company had net cash outflow representing overall principal advances of $28.2 million in 2015 compared to net principal collections of $56.7 million for 2014. For investment securities, the Company had net cash inflows of $35.8 million for 2015 compared with net cash outflows of $7.0 million for the prior year. Net cash inflows related to investments represent net sale, maturity, and call activity, where proceeds received from the sale, maturity, and calls exceed purchase of investment securities. For 2015, excess cash flows from investment activity were used more to fund new loans, deposit runoff, and the redemption of the final portion of the Company's preferred stock. In 2014, cash inflows were used to fund deposit runoff, debt repayments, and the redemption of a portion of the Company's preferred stock.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $22.2 million for 2015, a decrease of $31.4 million or 58.5% from $53.6 million for 2014. The decrease was driven by preferred stock redemptions, long-term and short-term borrowing activity, and deposit activity. The Company redeemed $10.0 million of its preferred stock outstanding in 2015 and $20.0 million in 2014. The company had net proceeds on long and short-term borrowings of $556 thousand and $5.8 million, respectively, for the current year compared to net repayments of $8.2 million and $533 thousand, respectively, for 2014. Net outflows related to deposits were $18.2 million for 2015, a decrease of $4.9 million compared to $23.1 million for 2014.\nInformation relating to commitments to extend credit is disclosed in Note 15 of the Company's 2015 audited consolidated financial statements. These transactions are entered into in the ordinary course of providing traditional banking services and are considered in managing the Company's liquidity position. The Company does not expect these commitments to significantly affect the liquidity position in future periods. The Company has not entered into any contracts for financial derivative instruments such as futures, swaps, options, or similar instruments.\nCAPITAL RESOURCES\nShareholders' equity was $176 million at year-end 2015, an increase of $2.8 million or 1.6% compared to $173 million at year-end 2014. Net income for the period increased shareholders' equity by $15.0 million, partially offset by the redemption of the remaining portion of the Company's preferred stock in the amount of $10.0 million during the second quarter, and a $2.0 million after-tax decrease in the unrealized gain on available for sale investment securities. The decrease in the unrealized gain on available for sale investment securities is attributed to an increase in market interest rates. Generally, as market interest rates rise, the value of fixed rate investments such as those held by the Company, decreases.\nOn January 9, 2009, the Company issued 30,000 shares of Series A, no par value cumulative perpetual preferred stock. The Company redeemed 20,000 of the preferred shares during 2014. On June 8, 2015, the Company redeemed the final 10,000 shares at the stated liquidation value of $1,000 per share, plus accrued dividends of $58 thousand. There was no additional debt or equity issued by the Company in connection with any of the shares redeemed.\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company's tangible capital ratio was 9.89% and 9.68%, respectively. The tangible capital ratio is defined as tangible equity as a percentage of tangible assets. Tangible common equity to tangible assets, which further excludes outstanding preferred stock, was 9.89% at year-end 2015, up 77 basis points compared to 9.12% at year-end 2014.\nConsistent with the objective of operating a sound financial organization, the Company's goal is to maintain capital ratios well above the regulatory minimum requirements. The Company's capital ratios as of December 31, 2015 and the regulatory minimums were as follows:\n\n1Common Equity Tier 1 ( CET1\u201d) Risk-based, Tier 1 Risk-based, and Total Risk-based Capital ratios are computed by dividing Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1, or Total Capital, as defined by regulation, by a risk-weighted sum of the assets, with the risk weighting determined by general standards established by regulation. The safest assets (e.g., government obligations) are assigned a weighting of 0% with riskier assets receiving higher ratings (e.g., ordinary commercial loans are assigned a weighting of 100%).\n2Tier 1 Leverage ratio is computed by dividing Tier 1 Capital by total quarterly average assets, as defined by regulation.\nIn July 2013, banking regulators issued final rules to bring U.S. banking organizations into compliance with the Basel III capital framework effective in 2015. The Company remains well-capitalized under the new rules, including meeting the effective minimum capital ratios with a fully phased-in capital conservation buffer. For further information, see discussion in Part I, Item 1 under the caption Capital\u201d beginning on page 15 of this Form 10-K.\nThe table below represents an analysis of dividend payout ratios and equity to asset ratios for the previous five years.\n\nSubsidiary Banks\nThe Company's subsidiary banks are subject to capital-based regulatory requirements which place banks in one of five categories based upon their capital levels and other supervisory criteria. These five categories are: (1) well-capitalized, (2) adequately capitalized, (3) undercapitalized, (4) significantly undercapitalized, and (5) critically undercapitalized. To be well-capitalized, a bank must have a CET1 Risk-based Capital ratio of at least 6.5%, a Tier 1 Risk-based Capital ratio of 8%, a Total Risk-based Capital ratio of at least 10%, and a Tier 1 Leverage ratio of at least 5%. As of December 31, 2015, each of the Company's four subsidiary banks had the following capital ratios for regulatory purposes:\n\nUnited Bank. During January 2014, United Bank entered into a Memorandum of Understanding ( Memorandum\u201d) with the FDIC and Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions ( KDFI\u201d), which replaced regulatory agreements dating back to November 2009 primarily relating to the bank's level of nonperforming assets. This Memorandum was terminated in March 2015. In connection with the termination of the Memorandum, the Board of Directors of United Bank agreed to adopt a resolution which included many of the same provisions as the Memorandum, including the requirement to seek approval from the FDIC and KDFI prior to the payment of dividends to the Parent Company. United Bank has both complied with and satisfied the terms of the resolution. As of January 2016, all regulatory agreements and board resolutions between the FDIC, KDFI, and United Bank have been terminated.\nCitizens Northern. The FDIC and KDFI entered into a Memorandum with Citizens Northern in September 2010. This Memorandum was terminated and replaced in July 2013. The updated Memorandum included provisions that required the bank to maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio at or above 9.0% and to obtain regulatory approval before declaring or paying a dividend to the Parent Company. The Memorandum was terminated in August 2015 following a joint examination by the FDIC and KDFI, which found satisfactory compliance with the terms of the Memorandum and overall improvement in financial condition.\nShare Buy Back Program\nAt various times, the Company's Board of Directors has authorized the purchase of shares of the Company's outstanding common stock. No stated expiration dates have been established under any of the previous authorizations. There are 84,971 shares that may still be purchased under the various authorizations, though no shares have been purchased since 2008.\nShareholder Information\nAs of February 4, 2016, the Company had 2,804 shareholders of record, which includes individual participants in securities positions listings.\nCommon Stock Price\nThe Company's common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC exchange in the Global Select Market tier, with sales prices reported under the symbol: FFKT. The table below lists the high and low sales prices of the Company's common stock for 2015 and 2014.\n\nThe closing price per share of the Company's common stock on December 31, 2015, the last trading day of the Company's fiscal year, was $27.11. There were no dividends declared on the Company's common stock in 2015 or 2014.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nSee Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d under the caption Recently Issued But Not Yet Effective Accounting Standards,\u201d in the Company's 2015 audited consolidated financial statements for further information about recently issued accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on the Company's financial statements.\n2014 Compared to 2013\nThe Company reported net income of $16.5 million or $1.94 per common share in 2014 compared to $13.4 million or $1.54 per common share for 2013. This represents an increase of $3.0 million or $.40 per common share. The increase in net income is primarily attributed to a decrease in the provision for loan losses of $1.8 million, an increase in noninterest income of $1.2 million or 5.2%, and lower net interest income and noninterest expenses of $539 thousand or 1.0% and $2.3 million or 3.7%, respectively. Income tax expense increased $1.7 million or 37.5%.\nFor 2014, the decrease in net interest income from 2013 was driven by lower interest income of $2.4 million or 3.6%, which more than offset a reduction in interest expense of $1.8 million or 15.4%. Interest income on loans decreased $3.6 million or 6.7%, partially offset by an increase in interest from investment securities of $1.2 million or 9.2%. Interest expense on deposits decreased $1.7 million or 28.2%. Interest income on loans was negatively impacted by both volume declines and a lower average rate earned. The increase in interest income on investment securities was driven by higher volume. Interest expense on deposits decreased primarily due to the repricing of higher-rate time deposits to lower market interest rates and a lower average balance outstanding. Net interest margin was 3.37% for 2014, down three basis points from 3.40% for 2013. Net interest spread was 3.21%, down two basis points compared to 3.23%.\nThe Company recorded a credit to the provision for loan losses in the amount of $4.4 million and $2.6 million for 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increased credit was due to continued overall improvement in the credit quality of the loan portfolio combined with a $67.9 million or 6.8% decline in loans outstanding. Nonperforming loans, impaired loans, early stage delinquencies, and watch list loans all improved during 2014. Historical loss rates, adjusted for current risk factors, also improved as lower charge-off activity replaced the higher levels that spiked upward starting in 2009.\nNonperforming loans decreased $14.6 million or 28.9% in 2014. The allowance for loan losses was $14.0 million at year-end 2014 and $20.6 million at year-end 2013. As a percentage of loans net of unearned income, the allowance for loan losses decreased 56 basis points to 1.50% at year-end 2014 compared to 2.06% a year earlier.\nNoninterest income for 2014 was $23.3 million, an increase of $1.2 million or 5.2% compared to $22.1 million for 2013. The increase was driven mainly by income related to the Company's equity interest in its three tax credit partnerships and trust fees. The Company recorded income of $358 thousand related to these partnerships for 2014 compared with a loss of $304 thousand in the prior year. Trust fees were up $575 thousand or 28.9%, boosted by unusually large nonrecurring estate fees of $412 thousand during the last half of 2014. Income from company-owned life insurance increased $269 thousand or 28.0%, driven by a tax-free death benefit that exceeded the cash surrender value by $276 thousand. Service charges and fees on deposits decreased $395 thousand or 4.8% primarily due to lower overdraft fees of $325 thousand or 6.6%, reflecting a decrease in volume attributed in part to overall trends in consumer behavior. Net gains on the sale of loans decreased $546 thousand or 52.7% due to a 51.0% decline in mortgage loan origination activity.\nTotal noninterest expenses were $59.3 million for 2014, a decrease of $2.3 million or 3.7% compared to $61.6 million for 2013. The decrease in noninterest expenses was made up primarily by lower expenses related to repossessed real estate of $1.7 million or 24.0% and lower deposit insurance expense of $519 thousand or 22.9%. Other noninterest expense and intangible asset amortization decreased $484 thousand or 6.2% and $135 thousand or 25.0%, respectively.\nThe $1.7 million decrease in expenses related to repossessed real estate was driven by lower impairment charges of $2.9 million or 52.4%, partially offset by an increase in the net loss on property sales of $594 thousand and higher development, operating, and maintenance expenses of $617 thousand. Deposit insurance expense decreased $519 thousand mainly from the improved risk ratings used in determining the related insurance premiums. The decrease in other noninterest expense is attributable to ongoing cost saving efforts involving numerous line items, the most significant of which was lower internet banking related expenses of $260 thousand or 31.1%. Amortization of intangible assets declined as a result of actuarial determined reductions related to core deposit and customer relationship intangible assets arising from previous business acquisitions.\nIncome tax expense was $6.1 million for 2014, an increase of $1.7 million or 37.5% compared to $4.4 million for 2013. The effective income tax rates were 27.0% and 24.8% for 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase in income tax expense and the effective tax rate is attributed primarily to higher pretax income, which was driven by a higher proportion of taxable versus tax-exempt sources of revenue.", "item_7_tables": "Table 100: <table> <tr> <td> (In thousands, except per share data)\nYears Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td>

(MD&A) for Farmers Capital Bank Corporation (FCBC) covers the company's consolidated financial condition and its operational results for the year ending December 31, 2015. FCBC is a bank holding company with several subsidiaries including four banks located in Central and Northern Kentucky, and other nonbank subsidiaries related to data processing and insurance services.\n\nFinancial highlights include:\n\n- Loan portfolio grew by $27.3 million (2.9%) from the previous year.\n- Nonperforming assets dropped to $54.1 million, the lowest level since the first quarter of 2009.\n- A credit of $3.4 million was recorded for loan losses.\n- Net income was reported at $15.0 million for 2015, down from $16.5 million in 2014.\n- Decline in the net interest income due to reduced interest from loans and lower interest rates on investment securities.\n- Noninterest income reached $22.2 million with a slight decrease from the previous year, partly due to lower overdraft fees and other service charges.\n- Noninterest expenses decreased, particularly due to lower real estate-related expenses and lower deposit insurance expense.\n- Income tax expense was $5.3 million, with an effective tax rate of 26.1%.\n\nRegarding assets and liquidity, FCBC had:\n\n- Liquid assets of $703 million by the year-end, a decrease from the previous year.\n- $236 million in additional borrowing capacity available under various agreements.\n\nCapital resources saw a rise in shareholders' equity to $176 million from $173 million in the previous year due to net income and despite the redemption of preferred stock and decrease in other comprehensive income. The capital ratios of the company, including Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 Risk-based, Total Risk-based, and Tier 1 Leverage ratios, remained well above the regulatory minimum requirements.\n\nThe company has several contractual obligations including time deposits, long-term debt, operating leases, and employment agreements, which are managed within its liquidity framework. FCBC maintained well-capitalized status under revised Basel III capital framework effective in 2015.\n\nFCBC's stock is traded on NASDAQ under the symbol \"FFKT\". There was no common stock dividend declared in 2015 and 2014, and no shares were bought back during the same period.\n\nIn 2014, compared to 2013, the company saw increased net income attributed to a diminished provision for loan losses, a rise in noninterest income, and a slight decrease in net interest income and noninterest expenses. There were reductions in expenses related to repossessed real estate and deposit insurance expense, while income tax expense increased mainly due to a rise in pretax income.\n\nThe MD&A includes details about recently issued accounting standards that may impact future financial statements, such as Basel III compliance and other relevant standards. The company appears poised for gradual improvement, managing its credit risk and asset quality while maintaining sufficient liquidity and capital resources.\n\n(Note: This condensed summary does not cover all details and includes estimates and projections.
