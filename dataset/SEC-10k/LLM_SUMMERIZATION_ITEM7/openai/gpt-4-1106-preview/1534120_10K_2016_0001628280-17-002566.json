Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company that is developing innovative drug candidates to make a difference in the lives of patients with neurological and psychiatric disorders. We have a portfolio of clinical and preclinical compounds that we believe are best in class due to their unique mechanism of action and where human proof of concept has been established for the compound or the target. At December 31, 2016, we had $5.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and $4.3 million in current liabilities. Accordingly, we do not have sufficient funds to finance our continuing operations beyond the short term. We must secure additional financing to further advance any of our product candidates, including our planned initiation of a Phase 2/3 clinical trial with CERC-501 as an adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder, or MDD, in the next year, and our plan to commence Phase 1 development of CERC-611 in 2017. Other than three third-party sponsored trials of CERC-501, we do not have any ongoing clinical trials of our product candidates and we do not currently have the capital to undertake any such trials. We are continuing preclinical development of our preclinical product candidate, CERC-611, but we would require additional funding to advance it into clinical trials.\nCERC-501 is a potent and selective kappa opioid receptor, or KOR, antagonist being developed as an adjunctive treatment of MDD. KORs are believed to play key roles in modulating stress, mood and addictive behaviors, which form the basis of co-occurring disorders. We plan to initiate a Phase 2/3 clinical study in inadequately treated subjects with MDD currently on antidepressants in the next year, subject to the availability of additional funding. Currently, three externally funded clinical trials are being conducted to evaluate the use of CERC-501 in treating depressive symptoms, stress-related smoking relapse and cocaine addiction. One trial is being conducted under the auspices of the National Institute of Mental Health, the second trial is a collaboration between Cerecor and Yale University with funding from the National Institutes of Health and the third trial is being conducted at Rockefeller University Hospital with funding from a private foundation.\nCERC-301 is an oral, NR2B specific N-methyl-D-aspartate, or NMDA, receptor antagonist being developed as an adjunctive treatment of MDD. CERC-301 belongs to a class of compounds known as antagonists, or inhibitors, of the NMDA receptor, a receptor subtype of the glutamate neurotransmitter system that is responsible for controlling neurological adaptation. We believe CERC-301 has the potential to produce a significant reduction in depression symptoms in a matter of days, as compared to weeks or months with conventional therapies, because it specifically blocks the NMDA receptor subunit 2B, or NR2B. We believe this mechanism of action may provide rapid and significant antidepressant activity without the adverse side effect profile of non-selective NMDA receptor antagonists, such as ketamine. We are currently evaluating potential next steps for this program.\nCERC-611 is a potent and selective transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins, or TARP, \u03b3-8-dependent \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor antagonist, which we plan to develop as an adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures, with or without secondarily generalized seizures, in patients with epilepsy. We intend to file an investigational new drug application with the FDA and thereafter commence Phase 1 development in 2017, subject to the availability of additional funding.\nCERC-406 is our lead preclinical candidate from our proprietary platform of compounds that inhibit catechol-O-methyltransferase, or COMT, within the brain, which we refer to as our COMTi platform. We intend to develop CERC-406 for the treatment of residual cognitive impairment symptoms in patients with MDD, subject to the availability of additional funding.\nFurther development of our product candidates will not be possible unless we secure additional funding. Our strategy is to seek funding for our operations from further offerings of equity and debt securities, non-dilutive financing arrangements such as federal grants, collaboration agreements or out-licensing arrangements, and to explore strategic alternatives such as an acquisition, merger, or business combination. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or transactions on favorable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements or\ntransactions in the short term, we will have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development and/or commercialization of one or more of our product candidates or cease our operations altogether.\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in 2011 and commenced operations in the second quarter of 2011. Since inception, our operations have included organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital and developing our product candidates. We have no products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales to date, and we continue to incur significant research, development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. We have incurred losses in each period since our inception. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $70.0 million. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue the development and clinical trials of, and seek marketing approval for, our product candidates. Our recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date that our financial statements were issued, and our ability to continue as a going concern will require us to obtain additional financing to fund our operations.\nWe have financed our operations primarily through a public offering, private placements of our common stock and convertible preferred stock, and the issuance of debt. Our ability to become and remain profitable depends on our ability to generate product revenue. We do not expect to generate any product revenue unless, and until, we obtain marketing approval for, and commercialize, any of our product candidates. There can be no assurance as to whether or when we will achieve profitability.\nRecent Developments\nThe Aspire Capital Transaction\nOn September 8, 2016, we entered into a common stock purchase agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, with Aspire Capital Fund, LLC, or Aspire Capital, pursuant to which Aspire Capital committed to purchase up to an aggregate of $15.0 million of shares of our common stock over the 30-month term of the Purchase Agreement. Upon execution of the Purchase Agreement, we issued and sold to Aspire Capital 250,000 shares of common stock at a price per share of $4.00, for gross proceeds of $1.0 million. Additionally, as consideration for Aspire Capital entering into the Purchase Agreement, we issued 175,000 shares of common stock as a commitment fee. The net proceeds of the Aspire Capital transaction, after offering expenses, were approximately $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, we had sold 763,998 shares of common stock to Aspire Capital. Subsequent to December 31, 2016, we sold an additional 965,165 shares of common stock to Aspire Capital under the terms of the Purchase Agreement for gross proceeds of approximately $789,000. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we may not issue additional shares of common stock to Aspire Capital under the Purchase Agreement unless shareholder approval to issue additional shares is obtained.\nThe Maxim Group Equity Distribution Agreement\nOn January 27, 2017, we entered into an equity distribution agreement, or the Equity Distribution Agreement, with Maxim Group LLC, or Maxim, as sales agent, pursuant to which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock through Maxim from time to time. We have no obligation to sell any of the shares, and may at any time suspend offers under the Equity Distribution Agreement.\nAs of the date of this filing, we had sold 345,653 shares of our common stock through Maxim under the Equity Distribution Agreement for gross proceeds of $287,000. Immediately after we file this Annual Report on Form 10-K we expect that the amount of additional securities we will be able to sell under the registration statement on Form S-3 will be approximately $3.3 million.\nEngagement of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey to Assist with Review of Strategic Alternatives\nOn February 7, 2017, we announced the engagement of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., or SunTrust, as our exclusive financial advisor to assist with our ongoing process to explore and review a range of strategic alternatives focused on maximizing stockholder value. Potential strategic alternatives that may be explored or evaluated as part of this process include an acquisition, merger, business combination or other strategic transaction. We have not made a decision to pursue any specific transaction or other strategic alternative, and there can be no assurance that this ongoing process will result in any such transaction.\nComponents of Operating Results\nRevenue\nTo date, we have derived all of our revenue from research grants from the National Institutes of Health. We have not generated any revenue from commercial product sales to date. We will not generate any commercial revenue, if ever, until one of our product candidates receives marketing approval and we successfully commercialize such product candidate.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOur research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred acquiring, developing, testing and seeking marketing approval for our product candidates. These costs include both external costs, which are study-specific costs, and internal research and development costs, which are not directly allocated to our product candidates.\nExternal costs include:\nTable 309: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>expenses incurred under agreements with third-party contract research organizations, or CROs, and investigative sites that conduct our clinical trials, preclinical studies and regulatory activities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 310: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>payments made to contract manufacturers for drug substance and acquiring, developing and manufacturing clinical trial materials; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 311: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>payments related to acquisitions of our product candidates and preclinical platform and milestone payments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInternal costs include:\nTable 312: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>personnel-related expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 313: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>consulting costs related to our internal research and development programs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 314: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>allocated facilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include rent and utilities, as well as other supplies; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 315: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>product liability insurance.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. We record costs for some development activities, such as clinical trials, based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as subject enrollment, clinical site activations or information provided to us by our vendors.\nWe track external costs by discovery program and subsequently by product candidate once a product candidate has been selected for development. Product candidates in later stage clinical development generally have higher research and development expenses than those in earlier stages of development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of the clinical trials.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had eight full-time employees who were primarily engaged in research and development. We expect our research and development expenses to decrease significantly in 2017, unless the necessary capital is raised to fund the further development of our product candidates.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of professional fees, patent costs and salaries, benefits and related costs for executive and other personnel, including stock-based compensation and travel expenses. Other general and administrative expenses include facility-related costs, communication expenses and professional fees for legal, including patent-related expenses, consulting, tax and accounting services, insurance, depreciation and general corporate expenses. We expect our general and administrative expenses to decrease in 2017.\nChange in Fair Value of Warrant Liability, Unit Purchase Option Liability and Investor Rights Obligation\nIn connection with the issuance of our term debt facility in August 2014, we issued warrants to purchase 625,208 shares of Series B convertible preferred stock. Upon the closing of our initial public offering, or IPO, in October 2015 these warrants became warrants to purchase 22,328 shares of common stock, in accordance with their terms. These warrants represent a freestanding financial instrument that is indexed to an obligation, which we refer to as the Warrant Liability. These\nwarrants are classified as a liability at fair value. This liability is remeasured at each balance sheet date and the change in fair value is recorded within our statement of operations.\nAs part of our IPO, the underwriter received a unit purchase option, or UPO, to purchase up to 40,000 units, whereby a unit is comprised of one share of our common stock, one Class A warrant to purchase one share of our common stock and one Class B warrant to purchase one-half share of our common stock. The UPO is classified as a liability at its respective fair value. This liability is remeasured at each balance sheet date and the change in fair value is recorded within our statement of operations.\nOur obligation to issue additional shares of our Series B preferred stock as part of the Series B preferred stock offering was accounted for as a freestanding financial instrument, which we referred to as the Investor Rights Obligation. The Investor Rights Obligation expired upon the closing of our IPO in accordance with its terms, and the related liability was reduced to zero at that time.\nInterest Expense, net\nNet interest expense is primarily related to interest payments pursuant to the terms of our term debt facility entered into in August 2014, as well as the amortization of the debt discounts and premiums and deferred financing fees in connection with such term debt facility.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period. In accordance with GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those related to clinical and preclinical trial expenses and stock-based compensation. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to the audited financial statements appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results. We have reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors.\nGrant Revenue Recognition\nWe recognize grant revenue when there is (i) reasonable assurance of compliance with the conditions of the grant and (ii) reasonable assurance that the grant will be received. We recognize revenue under grants in earnings on a systemic basis in the period the related expenditures for which the grants are intended to compensate are incurred.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. We rely heavily on third parties to conduct preclinical and clinical trials, as well as for the manufacture of our clinical trial supplies. Costs for certain development activities, such as clinical trials, are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as subject enrollment, clinical site activations or information provided to us by our vendors with respect to their actual costs incurred. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual arrangements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and are reflected in the financial statements as prepaid or accrued research and development expense, as the case may be.\nIncome Taxes\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $52.2 million of federal and Maryland state net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards that will begin to expire in 2031. As of December 31, 2016, we had $1.8 million and $57,000 of federal and Maryland State research and development credits, respectively, that will begin to expire in 2018. The NOL and research and development credit carryforwards are subject to review and possible adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service and state tax authorities. NOL and tax credit carryforwards may become subject to an annual limitation in the event of certain cumulative\nchanges in the ownership interest of significant shareholders over a three-year period in excess of 50%, as defined under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, as well as similar state tax provisions. This could limit the amount of NOLs that we can utilize annually to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities. We have not analyzed the historical or potential impact of our equity financings on beneficial ownership and therefore no determination has been made whether the NOL carryforwards are subject to any Internal Revenue Code Section 382 limitation. To the extent there is a limitation, there would be a reduction in the deferred tax asset with an offsetting reduction in the valuation allowance. Subsequent ownership changes may further affect the limitation in future years. All of our tax years are currently open to examination by each tax jurisdiction in which we are subject to taxation.\nEstimated Fair Value of Warrants, Unit Purchase Option and Investor Rights Obligation\nWarrants for shares that are contingently redeemable are accounted for as freestanding financial instruments. These warrants are classified as liabilities on our balance sheet and are recorded at their estimated fair value. At the end of each reporting period, changes in the estimated fair value during the period are recorded as a component of other income (expense), net. We will continue to adjust these liabilities for changes in fair value until the earlier of the expiration or the exercise of the warrants. We estimate the fair value of these warrants using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The significant assumptions used in preparing the option-pricing model for valuing the warrants as of December 31, 2016, included (i) volatility of 100%, (ii) risk free interest rate of 1.65%, (iii) strike price ($8.40), (iv) fair value of common stock ($0.88), and (v) expected life of 3.8 years. Significant decreases in our stock price volatility will significantly decrease the overall valuation of the warrants, while significant increases in our stock price volatility will significantly increase the overall valuation.\nAs part of our IPO we offered our underwriters the UPO to purchase up to an additional 40,000 units. The UPO is accounted for as a freestanding financial instrument and is recorded a liability on our balance sheet at its estimated fair value. At the end of each reporting period, the change in the estimated fair value during the period is recorded as component of other income (expense), net. We will continue to adjust this liability for changes in fair value until the earlier of expiration or the exercise of the UPO. We estimate the fair value of the UPO using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model within a Monte Carlo simulation model framework. The significant assumptions used in preparing the simulation model for valuing the UPO as of December 31, 2016, include (i) volatility range of 65% to 90%, (ii) risk free interest rate range of 0.44% to 1.64%, (iii) unit strike price ($7.48), (iv) underwriters' Class A warrant strike price ($5.23), (v) underwriters' Class B warrant strike price ($4.49), (vi) fair value of underlying equity ($0.88), and (vii) optimal exercise point of immediately prior to the expiration of the underwriters' Class B warrants, which occurs on April 20, 2017. Significant decreases in our stock price and our stock price volatility will significantly decrease the overall valuation of the UPO, while significant increases in our stock price and our stock price volatility will significantly increase the overall valuation.\nOur obligation to issue additional shares of our common stock arising from the 2014 Series B preferred stock offering, or the Investor Rights Obligation, was accounted for as a freestanding financial instrument. This obligation was classified as a liability on our balance sheet and was recorded at its estimated fair value. At the end of each reporting period, the change in the estimated fair value during the period was recorded as a component of other income (expense), net on the statement of operations. The Investor Rights Obligation expired upon the closing of our IPO in October 2015 in accordance with its terms, and the related liability was reduced to zero at that time.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure stock-based awards granted to our employees and nonemployee directors at fair value on the date of grant and recognize the corresponding compensation expense of those awards, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. Generally, we issue stock options and restricted stock with only service-based vesting conditions and record the expense for these awards using the straight-line method.\nWe measure stock-based awards granted to nonemployee consultants at the fair value of the award on the date at which the related service is complete. Expense is recognized over the period during which services are rendered by such nonemployee consultants until completed. At the end of each financial reporting period prior to the completion of the service, the fair value of these awards is re-measured using the then-current fair market value of our common stock and updated assumptions in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.\nThe fair value of each stock option grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. We estimate our expected volatility based on the historical volatility of our publicly traded peer companies and expect to continue to do so until such time as we have adequate historical data regarding the volatility of our traded stock price. Due to the lack of sufficient historical data for the term of our options, the expected term of our options granted to employees and non-employee directors has been estimated as the arithmetic average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option, while the\nexpected term of our options granted to consultants and nonemployees has been determined based on the contractual term of the options. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the United States Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nThe assumptions we used to determine the fair value of stock options granted to employees and nonemployee directors are as follows:\nTable 316: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.01\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.93\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.64\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.97\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.85\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.97\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected term of options (in years)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected stock price volatility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected annual dividend yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe estimates involved in the valuations include inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates when valuing our stock options, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different. We recognize compensation expense for only the portion of awards that are expected to vest. In developing a forfeiture rate estimate for pre-vesting forfeitures, we have considered our historical experience of actual forfeitures. If our future actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, our stock-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period.\nDetermination of the Fair Market Value of Common Stock\nWe considered numerous objective and subjective factors in the assessment of fair value of its common stock for grants made prior to the date our common stock began trading separately on the NASDAQ Capital Market, which was November 13, 2015 and includes all grants made from inception through November 9, 2015. The factors considered included the price for our convertible preferred stock that was sold to investors and the rights, preferences and privileges of our convertible preferred stock and common stock, the trading price of our units between the IPO date and November 13, 2015, our financial condition and results of operations during the relevant periods, including the status of the development of our product candidates, and the status of strategic initiatives. These estimates involve a significant level of judgment.\nIn the absence of a public trading market for our common stock prior to our initial public offering, our board of directors determined the fair market value of our common stock at various dates, with input from management, considering our most recently available third-party valuations of common stock and its assessment of additional objective and subjective factors that it believed were relevant and which may have changed from the date of the most recent valuation through the date of the grant.\nIn valuing our common stock prior to our initial public offering, the board of directors determined the equity value of our business by considering a number of valuation approaches and allocation methodologies. Valuation techniques considered included the Current Value Method, the Probability-Weighted Expected Return Method, or PWERM, the Option Pricing Method, or OPM, and the Hybrid Method. Given the range of possible financing and exit events that existed at the time we completed our valuations, which was prior to our initial public offering, we concluded the PWERM to be the most appropriate for purposes of valuing our common stock given our expected time to a liquidity event, subjectivity with regards to estimating possible proceeds from a future liquidation event and subjectivity with regards to the ability to estimate the probability of an IPO, sale or other financing events. The PWERM explicitly considered the various terms of our investor related documents, including various rights of each class of our stock, at the date of the liquidity event when those rights would either be executed or abandoned. Under the PWERM, the value of each class of our stock was estimated using a probability-weighted analysis of the present value of the returns afforded to our stockholders under each of the possible future exit scenarios. The scenarios included within the PWERM analysis included IPOs, a sale transaction, remaining private and dissolution.\nDiscrete future outcomes considered under the PWERM included non-IPO market based outcomes as well as IPO scenarios. In the non-IPO scenarios, a large portion of the equity value was allocated to the preferred stock to incorporate higher aggregate liquidation preferences. In the IPO scenarios, the equity value was allocated pro rata among the shares of common stock and each series of preferred stock, which caused the common stock to have a higher relative value per share than under the non-IPO scenario. The fair value of the enterprise determined using the IPO and non-IPO scenarios was\nweighted according to the board of directors' estimate of the probability of each scenario at the time the valuation was completed.\nWe have periodically determined the fair market value of our common stock at various dates using contemporaneous valuations performed in accordance with the guidance outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' Accounting and Valuation Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. Our common stock valuations were performed using a hybrid method, which used market approaches to determine our enterprise value. The hybrid method is a probability-weighted expected return method where the equity value in one or more of the scenarios is calculated using an option-pricing method. We selected the method based on availability and the quality of information to develop the assumptions for the methodology. We performed these contemporaneous valuations, with the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist, as of July 11, 2014, December 31, 2014, March 31, 2015, June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2015. In addition, our board of directors considered various objective and subjective factors, along with input from management, to determine the fair market value of our common stock as of each grant date, including the following:\nTable 317: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>prices at which we sold shares of our preferred stock and the superior rights and preferences of our preferred stock relative to our common stock;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 318: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the progress of our research and development programs, including the status of non-clinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 319: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our stage of development and commercialization and our business strategy;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 320: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our financial condition, including cash on hand;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 321: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our historical and forecasted performance and operating results;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 322: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the composition of, and changes to, our management team and board of directors;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 323: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the lack of an active public market for our common stock and our preferred stock;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 324: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as a sale of our company or an initial public offering, or IPO, given prevailing market conditions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 325: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the analysis of IPOs and the market performance of similar companies in the biopharmaceutical industry;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 326: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>external market conditions affecting the biopharmaceutical industry; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 327: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>trends within the biopharmaceutical industry.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe assumptions underlying these valuations represent management's determinations, which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment.

2016 and was comprised of revenue from two research and development grants awarded during the year. In April 2016, we were awarded a research and development grant of $1.02 million from the National Institute on Drug Abuse at the National Institutes of Health, or the NIDA Grant. This grant provided additional resources for the completed Phase 2 clinical trial of CERC-501. In July 2016, we were awarded a research and development grant of approximately $1.0 million from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism at the National Institutes of Health, or the NIAAA Grant. This grant provides additional resources to progress the development of CERC-501 for the treatment of alcohol use disorder. For the year ended December 31, 2016, grant revenue recognized from the NIDA Grant was $1.02 million and grant revenue recognized from the NIAAA Grant was $132,000. We did not have grant revenue in the 2015 period.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 330: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CERC-301\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,890\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CERC-501\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CERC-611\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>COMTi\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>260\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Internal expenses not allocated to programs:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaries, benefits and related costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>236\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>302\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,587\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses were $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $3.6 million compared to the 2015 period. This increase was largely due to the $2.0 million total upfront payment recorded in connection with the license of CERC-611 in September 2016, of which $750,000 was due and paid within 30 days of the effective date of the license agreement. The remaining balance of $1.25 million is due after the first subject is dosed with CERC-611 in a multiple ascending dose study and is recorded as other long term liabilities on the balance sheet at December 31, 2016. Additionally, costs for CERC-501 increased by $1.6 million, driven by the costs incurred in 2016 related to the enrollment activity and costs to complete our Phase 2 clinical trial for smoking cessation, which was completed in December. These costs were offset by $1.0 million of costs incurred in the 2015 period related to the in-licensing of CERC-501. Costs for CERC-301 decreased by $220,000 due to start-up costs incurred in 2015 to initiate our Phase 2 clinical trial for the adjunctive treatment of MDD, offset by 2016 costs related to the enrollment activity and costs to complete the trial, which was completed in November.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nThe following table summarizes our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 331: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaries, benefits and related costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Legal, consulting and other professional expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,806\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,554\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>328\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>480\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $2.7 million compared to the 2015 period. Legal, consulting and other professional expenses increased by $1.5 million, attributable primarily to audit, legal and other costs resulting from becoming a public company in October 2015, as well as certain financing expenses. Stock-based compensation expense increased by $1.2 million, driven by the modification of grants made to our former chief executive officer in the first quarter of 2016 in which the exercise term was extended, as well as the grant of additional awards in 2016 to our directors, executive officers and other employees. Further, other general and administrative expenses increased by $321,000 due to business development expenses and other costs. These increases were offset by a $404,000 decrease in salaries, benefits and related costs, driven by the $528,000 of severance expense recorded in 2015 due to the resignation of our former chief executive officer, offset by salary increases effected at the close of our initial public offering in October 2015.\nChange in Fair Value of Warrant Liability, Unit Purchase Option Liability and Investor Rights Obligation\nWe recognized a gain on the change in fair value of our warrant liability, UPO liability and investor rights obligation of $73,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to a gain of $1.3 million during the 2015 period. The $73,000 gain on the change in fair value during the year ended December 31, 2016 was due to the decrease in fair value of our warrant liability and UPO liability, both attributable to the decrease in our common stock price at December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015.\nThe $1.3 million gain on the change in fair value during the 2015 period resulted from the expiration of the investor rights obligation in October 2015 upon the closing of our initial public offering.\nInterest Expense, Net\nNet interest expense decreased by $329,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in interest associated with a reduction in the principal balance of our secured term loan facility.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nResearch and Development Expenses\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 332: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CERC-301\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CERC-501\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>COMTi\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>761\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FP01\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Internal expenses not allocated to programs:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaries, benefits and related costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,277\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>202\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>262\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,587\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses were $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $5.7 million compared to the 2014 period. This decrease resulted from a $5.6 million decrease in external research and development costs for CERC-301. A Phase 2 clinical trial for CERC-301 was completed in 2014 and, due to the failed results in an 8 mg study for CERC-301, we initiated a second Phase 2 trial later in 2015, increasing the dosage. External research and development costs for COMTi also decreased in 2015 by $501,000 due to a reduction in preclinical trial activity. There was also a decrease of $910,000 in salaries, benefits and related costs due to a reduction in headcount. These decreases were offset by the in-licensing of CERC-501 in February 2015 for $1.1 million and an additional $0.4 million in development costs for CERC-501 thereafter.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nThe following table summarizes our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 333: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaries, benefits and related costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,619\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Legal, consulting and other professional expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,776\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>328\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>885\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>480\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>595\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $452,000 compared to the 2014 period. Stock-based compensation expense decreased by $557,000 due to certain awards to board members and company executives made in 2014 that were fully vested at the time of the award. Legal, consulting and other professional expenses decreased by $487,000, driven by the write-off of deferred offering costs in 2014 of $1.1 million when we had determined that our initial public offering was no longer probable of being consummated at such time, offset by increases in board member fees, directors' and officers' insurance expense, recruiting expense, accounting and audit fees, legal fees and consulting expenses totaling $0.6 million, primarily a result of becoming a public company in 2015. Salaries, benefits and related costs increased by $707,000, which was driven by $528,000 of severance expense recorded in 2015 due to the resignation of our former chief executive officer.\nChange in Fair Value of Warrant Liability and Investor Rights Obligation\nWe recognized a gain on the change in fair value of our warrant liability, UPO liability and Investor Rights Obligation of $1.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to a gain of $2.3 million during the 2014 period. The $1.3 million gain on the change in fair value in 2015 was driven by the expiration of the investor rights obligation in October 2015 upon the closing of our initial public offering.\nThe $2.3 million gain on the change in fair value in 2014 was driven by the issuance of warrants for shares of Series B convertible preferred stock and the investor rights obligation and their respective changes in fair value during the year due to the gain recognized from marking the warrants for shares of Series A-1 convertible preferred stock to market.\nInterest Expense, Net\nNet interest expense decreased by $413,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily due to the interest on the convertible promissory notes and demand notes we entered into in 2014. The convertible promissory notes and demand notes converted to Series B convertible preferred stock upon the completion of the Series B convertible preferred stock equity offering, and as such there was no comparable expense in 2015. This was offset by an increase in interest expense under our secured term loan facility that was entered into in August 2014.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have devoted most of our cash resources to research and development and general and administrative activities. Since our inception, we have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from our operations. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue the development and clinical trials of, and seek marketing approval for, our product candidates. We incurred net losses of $16.5 million, $10.5 million and $16.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. At December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $70.0 million, net working capital of $1.4 million and cash and cash equivalents of $5.1 million. To date, we have not generated any revenues from the sale of products and we do not anticipate generating any revenues from the sale of our product candidates for the foreseeable future. Historically, we have financed our operations principally through private placements of common and convertible preferred stock, convertible and nonconvertible debt, as well as our IPO in October 2015.\nWe will require substantial additional financing to fund our operations beyond the short term and to continue to execute our strategy. Further development of our product candidates will not be possible unless we secure additional funding. Our strategy is to seek funding for our operations from further offerings of equity or debt securities, non-dilutive financing arrangements such as federal grants, collaboration agreements or out-licensing arrangements, and to explore strategic alternatives such as an acquisition, merger, or business combination. Based on our current research and development plans we\nexpect that our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements well into the second quarter of 2017. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date that our financial statements were issued.\nTerm Loan\nIn August 2014, we received a $7.5 million secured term loan from a finance company. The loan is secured by a lien on our assets, excluding intellectual property, which is subject to a negative pledge. The loan contains certain additional nonfinancial covenants. In connection with the loan agreement, our cash and investment accounts are subject to account control agreements with the finance company that give the finance company the right to assume control of the accounts in the event of a loan default. Loan defaults are defined in the loan agreement and include, among others, the finance company's determination that there is a material adverse change in our operations, notwithstanding adverse results of clinical trials. Interest on the loan is at a rate of the greater of 7.95%, or 7.95% plus the prime rate as reported in The Wall Street Journal minus 3.25%. The interest rate effective from loan inception to December 16, 2015 was 7.95%. Effective December 17, 2015, the prime rate as reported by The Wall Street Journal increased 0.25% resulting in the interest rate increasing to 8.20%. Effective December 15, 2016, the prime rate as reported by The Wall Street Journal increased another 0.25% resulting in an increase to the interest rate, which was 8.45% as of December 31, 2016. The loan was interest-only for nine months, and is repayable in equal monthly payments of principal and interest of approximately $305,000 over 27 months, which began in June 2015. The loan terminates in the third quarter of 2017 and has an outstanding balance as of December 31, 2016 of $2.4 million.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 334: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(14,573\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10,163\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(15,518\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(35\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,426\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(16,034\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash used in operating activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $14.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and consisted primarily of a net loss of $16.5 million, offset by non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $1.7 million, non-cash interest expense of $162,000 and an increase in accounts payable of $332,000.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and consisted primarily of a net loss of $10.5 million, a non-cash $1.3 million gain on the change in fair value of the warrant liability, UPO liability and Investor Rights Obligation driven by the expiration of the Investor Rights Obligation during the year and a decrease in accounts payable of $269,000. These were offset by a $1.1 million increase in accrued expenses due to increased clinical trial activities and $528,000 of accrued severance expense due to the resignation of our former chief executive officer, non-cash stock compensation expense of $395,000 and non-cash interest expense of $294,000.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $15.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and consisted primarily of a net loss of $16.1 million, a non-cash $2.3 million gain on the change in fair value of the warrant liability and investor rights obligation and a decrease in accounts payable of $708,000. These were offset by non-cash stock compensation expense of $1.1 million, the write off of deferred public offering costs of $1.1 million, non-cash interest expense of $1.0 million and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $354,000.\nNet cash used in investing activities\nNet cash used in investing activities is limited to purchases of property and equipment consisting of computers and software and furniture and equipment. Our net cash used in investing activities was $35,000, $20,000, and $20,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which consisted of principal payments on our term loan of $3.3 million offset by net proceeds from the sale of common stock to Aspire Capital under the Purchase Agreement of $1.9 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $19.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and consisted primarily of proceeds from our initial public offering including the over-allotment option, net of underwriting discounts, commissions and expenses of $23.7 million, offset by the payment of offering costs related to the initial public offering of $2.3 million and principal payments on our term loan of $1.8 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $23.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and consisted primarily of proceeds from our convertible debt, demand notes, and Series B convertible preferred stock equity issuance aggregating $17.3 million as well as $7.4 million from our term loan entered into in August 2014. These proceeds were offset by the payment of $0.4 million in financing fees related to the equity and debt financing and $0.4 million for IPO-related deferred offering costs.\nOperating and Capital Expenditure Requirements\nWe have not achieved profitability since our inception and we expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. Following the closing of our IPO in October 2015, we expect to continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we were not previously required to incur as a private company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and the NASDAQ Stock Market, requires public companies to implement specified corporate governance practices that were previously inapplicable to us as a private company. We expect these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. We may also acquire or in-license new product candidates. Based on our research and development plans, we expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements well into the second quarter of 2017, which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date that our financial statements were issued. We will require substantial additional financing to fund our operations and to continue to develop our product candidates. Our strategy is to seek funding for our operations from further offerings of equity or debt securities, non-dilutive financing arrangements such as federal grants, collaboration agreements or out-licensing arrangements, and to explore strategic alternatives such as an acquisition, merger, or business combination\nEach of our product candidates are still in the early stages of clinical and preclinical development and the outcome of these efforts is uncertain. We cannot estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates or whether, or when, we may generate revenue.\nWe will need to raise substantial additional capital in the future to fund our operations and to further develop our product candidates and we anticipate funding our operations from further offerings of equity or debt securities, non-dilutive financing arrangements such as federal grants, collaboration agreements or out-licensing arrangements, and to explore strategic alternatives such as an acquisition, merger, or business combination. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional equity or debt financing, or strategic alternatives, on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing agreements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our product candidates, technologies or future revenue streams or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. There can also be no assurance that the exploration of strategic alternatives will result in any such transaction. Our future capital requirements will depend on many forward-looking factors, including:\nTable 335: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the progress and results of the three externally funded clinical trials being conducted for CERC-501 and changes to our development plan with respect to CERC-501, if any;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 336: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the progress of and our ability to successfully file an IND with the FDA for CERC-611, the progress and results of any subsequent clinical trials for CERC-611 and any changes to our development plan with respect to CERC-611, if any;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 337: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our plan and ability to enter into collaborative agreements for the development and commercialization of our product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 338: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the number and development requirements of any other product candidates that we may pursue;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 339: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing our product candidates or any future product candidates, both in the United States and in territories outside the United States;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 340: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates or any future product candidates, both in the United States and in territories outside the United States;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 341: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 342: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the costs and timing of any product candidate acquisition or in-licensing opportunities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 343: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>any product liability or other lawsuits related to our products;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 344: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the expenses needed to attract and retain skilled personnel;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 345: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;

We were contractually obligated for up to approximately $1.4 million of future services under these agreements as of December 31, 2016. Our actual contractual obligations will vary depending upon several factors, including the progress and results of the underlying services.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined by applicable SEC rules and regulations.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. The amendments in this update explicitly require a company's management to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued, and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. The new standard is effective in the first annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. We adopted the new guidance in the fourth quarter of 2016. The adoption of this guidance did not impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, nor did it significantly impact our disclosures regarding the assessment of our ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date that our financial statements were issued.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue From Contracts With Customers ( ASU 2014-09\u201d). Pursuant to this update, an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue From Contracts With Customers (Topic 606), which delays the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. As a result, ASU 2014-09 will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) ( ASU 2016-08\u201d) and ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue From Contracts With Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing ( ASU 2016-10\u201d), and in May 2016 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients ( ASU 2016-12\u201d), each of which clarify the guidance in ASU 2014-09 and have the same effective date as the original standard. We have not yet completed our determination of the impact of adopting ASU 2014-09, ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10, or ASU 2016-12 on the financial statements, although, we do not expect the impact, if any, to be significant. We expect to adopt the pronouncement on a full retrospective basis on January 1, 2018.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). This guidance revises existing practice related to accounting for leases under ASC 840, Leases ( ASC 840\u201d) for both lessees and lessors. The new guidance in ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for nearly all leases (other than leases that meet the definition of a short-term lease). The lease liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments and the right-of-use asset will be based on the lease liability, subject to adjustment such as for initial direct costs. For income statement purposes, the new standard retains a dual model similar to ASC 840, requiring leases to be classified as either operating leases or capital leases. For lessees, operating leases will result in straight-line expense (similar to current accounting by lessees for operating leases under ASC 840) while capital leases will result in a front-loaded expense pattern (similar to current accounting by lessees for capital leases under ASC 840). The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of this standard on our financial statements.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The guidance is intended to simplify several areas of accounting for share-based compensation, including income tax impacts, classification on the statement of cash flows and forfeitures. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2017 and its adoption will have no impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Restricted Cash. The guidance is intended to address the diversity that currently exists in the classification and presentation of changes in restricted cash on the statement of cash flows. The new standard requires that entities show the changes in the total of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents on the statement of cash flows and no longer present transfers between cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents on the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of this standard on our financial statements.\nJOBS Act\nThe JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce reporting requirements for an emerging growth company.\u201d As an emerging growth company, we have elected to not take advantage of the extended transition period afforded\nby the JOBS Act for the implementation of new or revised accounting standards and, as a result, will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies.\nInternal Control Over Financial Reporting\nAssessing our staffing and training procedures to improve our internal control over financial reporting is an ongoing process. We are not currently required to comply with all of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. For the year ended December 31, 2016, management is required to make an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as required by Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as further described in Item 9A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act exempts non-accelerated filers from compliance with Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which relates to the independent auditor's attestation on the effectiveness of the issuer's internal control over financial reporting. As such, our independent registered public accounting firm has not been engaged to express, nor have they expressed, an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company that is developing innovative drug candidates to make a difference in the lives of patients with neurological and psychiatric disorders. We have a portfolio of clinical and preclinical compounds that we believe are best in class due to their unique mechanism of action and where human proof of concept has been established for the compound or the target. At December 31, 2016, we had $5.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and $4.3 million in current liabilities. Accordingly, we do not have sufficient funds to finance our continuing operations beyond the short term. We must secure additional financing to further advance any of our product candidates, including our planned initiation of a Phase 2/3 clinical trial with CERC-501 as an adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder, or MDD, in the next year, and our plan to commence Phase 1 development of CERC-611 in 2017. Other than three third-party sponsored trials of CERC-501, we do not have any ongoing clinical trials of our product candidates and we do not currently have the capital to undertake any such trials. We are continuing preclinical development of our preclinical product candidate, CERC-611, but we would require additional funding to advance it into clinical trials.\nCERC-501 is a potent and selective kappa opioid receptor, or KOR, antagonist being developed as an adjunctive treatment of MDD. KORs are believed to play key roles in modulating stress, mood and addictive behaviors, which form the basis of co-occurring disorders. We plan to initiate a Phase 2/3 clinical study in inadequately treated subjects with MDD currently on antidepressants in the next year, subject to the availability of additional funding. Currently, three externally funded clinical trials are being conducted to evaluate the use of CERC-501 in treating depressive symptoms, stress-related smoking relapse and cocaine addiction. One trial is being conducted under the auspices of the National Institute of Mental Health, the second trial is a collaboration between Cerecor and Yale University with funding from the National Institutes of Health and the third trial is being conducted at Rockefeller University Hospital with funding from a private foundation.\nCERC-301 is an oral, NR2B specific N-methyl-D-aspartate, or NMDA, receptor antagonist being developed as an adjunctive treatment of MDD. CERC-301 belongs to a class of compounds known as antagonists, or inhibitors, of the NMDA receptor, a receptor subtype of the glutamate neurotransmitter system that is responsible for controlling neurological adaptation. We believe CERC-301 has the potential to produce a significant reduction in depression symptoms in a matter of days, as compared to weeks or months with conventional therapies, because it specifically blocks the NMDA receptor subunit 2B, or NR2B. We believe this mechanism of action may provide rapid and significant antidepressant activity without the adverse side effect profile of non-selective NMDA receptor antagonists, such as ketamine. We are currently evaluating potential next steps for this program.\nCERC-611 is a potent and selective transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins, or TARP, \u03b3-8-dependent \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor antagonist, which we plan to develop as an adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures, with or without secondarily generalized seizures, in patients with epilepsy. We intend to file an investigational new drug application with the FDA and thereafter commence Phase 1 development in 2017, subject to the availability of additional funding.\nCERC-406 is our lead preclinical candidate from our proprietary platform of compounds that inhibit catechol-O-methyltransferase, or COMT, within the brain, which we refer to as our COMTi platform. We intend to develop CERC-406 for the treatment of residual cognitive impairment symptoms in patients with MDD, subject to the availability of additional funding.\nFurther development of our product candidates will not be possible unless we secure additional funding. Our strategy is to seek funding for our operations from further offerings of equity and debt securities, non-dilutive financing arrangements such as federal grants, collaboration agreements or out-licensing arrangements, and to explore strategic alternatives such as an acquisition, merger, or business combination. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or transactions on favorable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements or\ntransactions in the short term, we will have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development and/or commercialization of one or more of our product candidates or cease our operations altogether.\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in 2011 and commenced operations in the second quarter of 2011. Since inception, our operations have included organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital and developing our product candidates. We have no products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales to date, and we continue to incur significant research, development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. We have incurred losses in each period since our inception. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $70.0 million. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue the development and clinical trials of, and seek marketing approval for, our product candidates. Our recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date that our financial statements were issued, and our ability to continue as a going concern will require us to obtain additional financing to fund our operations.\nWe have financed our operations primarily through a public offering, private placements of our common stock and convertible preferred stock, and the issuance of debt. Our ability to become and remain profitable depends on our ability to generate product revenue. We do not expect to generate any product revenue unless, and until, we obtain marketing approval for, and commercialize, any of our product candidates. There can be no assurance as to whether or when we will achieve profitability.\nRecent Developments\nThe Aspire Capital Transaction\nOn September 8, 2016, we entered into a common stock purchase agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, with Aspire Capital Fund, LLC, or Aspire Capital, pursuant to which Aspire Capital committed to purchase up to an aggregate of $15.0 million of shares of our common stock over the 30-month term of the Purchase Agreement. Upon execution of the Purchase Agreement, we issued and sold to Aspire Capital 250,000 shares of common stock at a price per share of $4.00, for gross proceeds of $1.0 million. Additionally, as consideration for Aspire Capital entering into the Purchase Agreement, we issued 175,000 shares of common stock as a commitment fee. The net proceeds of the Aspire Capital transaction, after offering expenses, were approximately $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, we had sold 763,998 shares of common stock to Aspire Capital. Subsequent to December 31, 2016, we sold an additional 965,165 shares of common stock to Aspire Capital under the terms of the Purchase Agreement for gross proceeds of approximately $789,000. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we may not issue additional shares of common stock to Aspire Capital under the Purchase Agreement unless shareholder approval to issue additional shares is obtained.\nThe Maxim Group Equity Distribution Agreement\nOn January 27, 2017, we entered into an equity distribution agreement, or the Equity Distribution Agreement, with Maxim Group LLC, or Maxim, as sales agent, pursuant to which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock through Maxim from time to time. We have no obligation to sell any of the shares, and may at any time suspend offers under the Equity Distribution Agreement.\nAs of the date of this filing, we had sold 345,653 shares of our common stock through Maxim under the Equity Distribution Agreement for gross proceeds of $287,000. Immediately after we file this Annual Report on Form 10-K we expect that the amount of additional securities we will be able to sell under the registration statement on Form S-3 will be approximately $3.3 million.\nEngagement of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey to Assist with Review of Strategic Alternatives\nOn February 7, 2017, we announced the engagement of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., or SunTrust, as our exclusive financial advisor to assist with our ongoing process to explore and review a range of strategic alternatives focused on maximizing stockholder value. Potential strategic alternatives that may be explored or evaluated as part of this process include an acquisition, merger, business combination or other strategic transaction. We have not made a decision to pursue any specific transaction or other strategic alternative, and there can be no assurance that this ongoing process will result in any such transaction.\nComponents of Operating Results\nRevenue\nTo date, we have derived all of our revenue from research grants from the National Institutes of Health. We have not generated any revenue from commercial product sales to date. We will not generate any commercial revenue, if ever, until one of our product candidates receives marketing approval and we successfully commercialize such product candidate.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOur research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred acquiring, developing, testing and seeking marketing approval for our product candidates. These costs include both external costs, which are study-specific costs, and internal research and development costs, which are not directly allocated to our product candidates.\nExternal costs include:\n \u2022 expenses incurred under agreements with third-party contract research organizations, or CROs, and investigative sites that conduct our clinical trials, preclinical studies and regulatory activities; \n \u2022 payments made to contract manufacturers for drug substance and acquiring, developing and manufacturing clinical trial materials; and \n \u2022 payments related to acquisitions of our product candidates and preclinical platform and milestone payments. \nInternal costs include:\n \u2022 personnel-related expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense; \n \u2022 consulting costs related to our internal research and development programs; \n \u2022 allocated facilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include rent and utilities, as well as other supplies; and \n \u2022 product liability insurance. \nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. We record costs for some development activities, such as clinical trials, based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as subject enrollment, clinical site activations or information provided to us by our vendors.\nWe track external costs by discovery program and subsequently by product candidate once a product candidate has been selected for development. Product candidates in later stage clinical development generally have higher research and development expenses than those in earlier stages of development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of the clinical trials.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had eight full-time employees who were primarily engaged in research and development. We expect our research and development expenses to decrease significantly in 2017, unless the necessary capital is raised to fund the further development of our product candidates.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of professional fees, patent costs and salaries, benefits and related costs for executive and other personnel, including stock-based compensation and travel expenses. Other general and administrative expenses include facility-related costs, communication expenses and professional fees for legal, including patent-related expenses, consulting, tax and accounting services, insurance, depreciation and general corporate expenses. We expect our general and administrative expenses to decrease in 2017.\nChange in Fair Value of Warrant Liability, Unit Purchase Option Liability and Investor Rights Obligation\nIn connection with the issuance of our term debt facility in August 2014, we issued warrants to purchase 625,208 shares of Series B convertible preferred stock. Upon the closing of our initial public offering, or IPO, in October 2015 these warrants became warrants to purchase 22,328 shares of common stock, in accordance with their terms. These warrants represent a freestanding financial instrument that is indexed to an obligation, which we refer to as the Warrant Liability. These\nwarrants are classified as a liability at fair value. This liability is remeasured at each balance sheet date and the change in fair value is recorded within our statement of operations.\nAs part of our IPO, the underwriter received a unit purchase option, or UPO, to purchase up to 40,000 units, whereby a unit is comprised of one share of our common stock, one Class A warrant to purchase one share of our common stock and one Class B warrant to purchase one-half share of our common stock. The UPO is classified as a liability at its respective fair value. This liability is remeasured at each balance sheet date and the change in fair value is recorded within our statement of operations.\nOur obligation to issue additional shares of our Series B preferred stock as part of the Series B preferred stock offering was accounted for as a freestanding financial instrument, which we referred to as the Investor Rights Obligation. The Investor Rights Obligation expired upon the closing of our IPO in accordance with its terms, and the related liability was reduced to zero at that time.\nInterest Expense, net\nNet interest expense is primarily related to interest payments pursuant to the terms of our term debt facility entered into in August 2014, as well as the amortization of the debt discounts and premiums and deferred financing fees in connection with such term debt facility.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period. In accordance with GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those related to clinical and preclinical trial expenses and stock-based compensation. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to the audited financial statements appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results. We have reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors.\nGrant Revenue Recognition\nWe recognize grant revenue when there is (i) reasonable assurance of compliance with the conditions of the grant and (ii) reasonable assurance that the grant will be received. We recognize revenue under grants in earnings on a systemic basis in the period the related expenditures for which the grants are intended to compensate are incurred.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. We rely heavily on third parties to conduct preclinical and clinical trials, as well as for the manufacture of our clinical trial supplies. Costs for certain development activities, such as clinical trials, are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as subject enrollment, clinical site activations or information provided to us by our vendors with respect to their actual costs incurred. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual arrangements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and are reflected in the financial statements as prepaid or accrued research and development expense, as the case may be.\nIncome Taxes\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $52.2 million of federal and Maryland state net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards that will begin to expire in 2031. As of December 31, 2016, we had $1.8 million and $57,000 of federal and Maryland State research and development credits, respectively, that will begin to expire in 2018. The NOL and research and development credit carryforwards are subject to review and possible adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service and state tax authorities. NOL and tax credit carryforwards may become subject to an annual limitation in the event of certain cumulative\nchanges in the ownership interest of significant shareholders over a three-year period in excess of 50%, as defined under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, as well as similar state tax provisions. This could limit the amount of NOLs that we can utilize annually to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities. We have not analyzed the historical or potential impact of our equity financings on beneficial ownership and therefore no determination has been made whether the NOL carryforwards are subject to any Internal Revenue Code Section 382 limitation. To the extent there is a limitation, there would be a reduction in the deferred tax asset with an offsetting reduction in the valuation allowance. Subsequent ownership changes may further affect the limitation in future years. All of our tax years are currently open to examination by each tax jurisdiction in which we are subject to taxation.\nEstimated Fair Value of Warrants, Unit Purchase Option and Investor Rights Obligation\nWarrants for shares that are contingently redeemable are accounted for as freestanding financial instruments. These warrants are classified as liabilities on our balance sheet and are recorded at their estimated fair value. At the end of each reporting period, changes in the estimated fair value during the period are recorded as a component of other income (expense), net. We will continue to adjust these liabilities for changes in fair value until the earlier of the expiration or the exercise of the warrants. We estimate the fair value of these warrants using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The significant assumptions used in preparing the option-pricing model for valuing the warrants as of December 31, 2016, included (i) volatility of 100%, (ii) risk free interest rate of 1.65%, (iii) strike price ($8.40), (iv) fair value of common stock ($0.88), and (v) expected life of 3.8 years. Significant decreases in our stock price volatility will significantly decrease the overall valuation of the warrants, while significant increases in our stock price volatility will significantly increase the overall valuation.\nAs part of our IPO we offered our underwriters the UPO to purchase up to an additional 40,000 units. The UPO is accounted for as a freestanding financial instrument and is recorded a liability on our balance sheet at its estimated fair value. At the end of each reporting period, the change in the estimated fair value during the period is recorded as component of other income (expense), net. We will continue to adjust this liability for changes in fair value until the earlier of expiration or the exercise of the UPO. We estimate the fair value of the UPO using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model within a Monte Carlo simulation model framework. The significant assumptions used in preparing the simulation model for valuing the UPO as of December 31, 2016, include (i) volatility range of 65% to 90%, (ii) risk free interest rate range of 0.44% to 1.64%, (iii) unit strike price ($7.48), (iv) underwriters' Class A warrant strike price ($5.23), (v) underwriters' Class B warrant strike price ($4.49), (vi) fair value of underlying equity ($0.88), and (vii) optimal exercise point of immediately prior to the expiration of the underwriters' Class B warrants, which occurs on April 20, 2017. Significant decreases in our stock price and our stock price volatility will significantly decrease the overall valuation of the UPO, while significant increases in our stock price and our stock price volatility will significantly increase the overall valuation.\nOur obligation to issue additional shares of our common stock arising from the 2014 Series B preferred stock offering, or the Investor Rights Obligation, was accounted for as a freestanding financial instrument. This obligation was classified as a liability on our balance sheet and was recorded at its estimated fair value. At the end of each reporting period, the change in the estimated fair value during the period was recorded as a component of other income (expense), net on the statement of operations. The Investor Rights Obligation expired upon the closing of our IPO in October 2015 in accordance with its terms, and the related liability was reduced to zero at that time.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure stock-based awards granted to our employees and nonemployee directors at fair value on the date of grant and recognize the corresponding compensation expense of those awards, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. Generally, we issue stock options and restricted stock with only service-based vesting conditions and record the expense for these awards using the straight-line method.\nWe measure stock-based awards granted to nonemployee consultants at the fair value of the award on the date at which the related service is complete. Expense is recognized over the period during which services are rendered by such nonemployee consultants until completed. At the end of each financial reporting period prior to the completion of the service, the fair value of these awards is re-measured using the then-current fair market value of our common stock and updated assumptions in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.\nThe fair value of each stock option grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. We estimate our expected volatility based on the historical volatility of our publicly traded peer companies and expect to continue to do so until such time as we have adequate historical data regarding the volatility of our traded stock price. Due to the lack of sufficient historical data for the term of our options, the expected term of our options granted to employees and non-employee directors has been estimated as the arithmetic average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option, while the\nexpected term of our options granted to consultants and nonemployees has been determined based on the contractual term of the options. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the United States Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nThe assumptions we used to determine the fair value of stock options granted to employees and nonemployee directors are as follows:\nTable 316: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.01\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.93\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.64\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.97\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.85\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.97\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected term of options (in years)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected stock price volatility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected annual dividend yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe estimates involved in the valuations include inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates when valuing our stock options, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different. We recognize compensation expense for only the portion of awards that are expected to vest. In developing a forfeiture rate estimate for pre-vesting forfeitures, we have considered our historical experience of actual forfeitures. If our future actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, our stock-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period.\nDetermination of the Fair Market Value of Common Stock\nWe considered numerous objective and subjective factors in the assessment of fair value of its common stock for grants made prior to the date our common stock began trading separately on the NASDAQ Capital Market, which was November 13, 2015 and includes all grants made from inception through November 9, 2015. The factors considered included the price for our convertible preferred stock that was sold to investors and the rights, preferences and privileges of our convertible preferred stock and common stock, the trading price of our units between the IPO date and November 13, 2015, our financial condition and results of operations during the relevant periods, including the status of the development of our product candidates, and the status of strategic initiatives. These estimates involve a significant level of judgment.\nIn the absence of a public trading market for our common stock prior to our initial public offering, our board of directors determined the fair market value of our common stock at various dates, with input from management, considering our most recently available third-party valuations of common stock and its assessment of additional objective and subjective factors that it believed were relevant and which may have changed from the date of the most recent valuation through the date of the grant.\nIn valuing our common stock prior to our initial public offering, the board of directors determined the equity value of our business by considering a number of valuation approaches and allocation methodologies. Valuation techniques considered included the Current Value Method, the Probability-Weighted Expected Return Method, or PWERM, the Option Pricing Method, or OPM, and the Hybrid Method. Given the range of possible financing and exit events that existed at the time we completed our valuations, which was prior to our initial public offering, we concluded the PWERM to be the most appropriate for purposes of valuing our common stock given our expected time to a liquidity event, subjectivity with regards to estimating possible proceeds from a future liquidation event and subjectivity with regards to the ability to estimate the probability of an IPO, sale or other financing events. The PWERM explicitly considered the various terms of our investor related documents, including various rights of each class of our stock, at the date of the liquidity event when those rights would either be executed or abandoned. Under the PWERM, the value of each class of our stock was estimated using a probability-weighted analysis of the present value of the returns afforded to our stockholders under each of the possible future exit scenarios. The scenarios included within the PWERM analysis included IPOs, a sale transaction, remaining private and dissolution.\nDiscrete future outcomes considered under the PWERM included non-IPO market based outcomes as well as IPO scenarios. In the non-IPO scenarios, a large portion of the equity value was allocated to the preferred stock to incorporate higher aggregate liquidation preferences. In the IPO scenarios, the equity value was allocated pro rata among the shares of common stock and each series of preferred stock, which caused the common stock to have a higher relative value per share than under the non-IPO scenario. The fair value of the enterprise determined using the IPO and non-IPO scenarios was\nweighted according to the board of directors' estimate of the probability of each scenario at the time the valuation was completed.\nWe have periodically determined the fair market value of our common stock at various dates using contemporaneous valuations performed in accordance with the guidance outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' Accounting and Valuation Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. Our common stock valuations were performed using a hybrid method, which used market approaches to determine our enterprise value. The hybrid method is a probability-weighted expected return method where the equity value in one or more of the scenarios is calculated using an option-pricing method. We selected the method based on availability and the quality of information to develop the assumptions for the methodology. We performed these contemporaneous valuations, with the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist, as of July 11, 2014, December 31, 2014, March 31, 2015, June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2015. In addition, our board of directors considered various objective and subjective factors, along with input from management, to determine the fair market value of our common stock as of each grant date, including the following:\n \u2022 prices at which we sold shares of our preferred stock and the superior rights and preferences of our preferred stock relative to our common stock; \n \u2022 the progress of our research and development programs, including the status of non-clinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates; \n \u2022 our stage of development and commercialization and our business strategy; \n \u2022 our financial condition, including cash on hand; \n \u2022 our historical and forecasted performance and operating results; \n \u2022 the composition of, and changes to, our management team and board of directors; \n \u2022 the lack of an active public market for our common stock and our preferred stock; \n \u2022 the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as a sale of our company or an initial public offering, or IPO, given prevailing market conditions; \n \u2022 the analysis of IPOs and the market performance of similar companies in the biopharmaceutical industry; \n \u2022 external market conditions affecting the biopharmaceutical industry; and \n \u2022 trends within the biopharmaceutical industry. \nThe assumptions underlying these valuations represent management's determinations, which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors or expected outcomes change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates, our equity-based compensation could be materially different.\nThe following table

2016 and was comprised of revenue from two research and development grants awarded during the year. In April 2016, we were awarded a research and development grant of $1.02 million from the National Institute on Drug Abuse at the National Institutes of Health, or the NIDA Grant. This grant provided additional resources for the completed Phase 2 clinical trial of CERC-501. In July 2016, we were awarded a research and development grant of approximately $1.0 million from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism at the National Institutes of Health, or the NIAAA Grant. This grant provides additional resources to progress the development of CERC-501 for the treatment of alcohol use disorder. For the year ended December 31, 2016, grant revenue recognized from the NIDA Grant was $1.02 million and grant revenue recognized from the NIAAA Grant was $132,000. We did not have grant revenue in the 2015 period.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 330: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CERC-301\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,890\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CERC-501\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CERC-611\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>COMTi\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>260\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Internal expenses not allocated to programs:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaries, benefits and related costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>236\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>302\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,587\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses were $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $3.6 million compared to the 2015 period. This increase was largely due to the $2.0 million total upfront payment recorded in connection with the license of CERC-611 in September 2016, of which $750,000 was due and paid within 30 days of the effective date of the license agreement. The remaining balance of $1.25 million is due after the first subject is dosed with CERC-611 in a multiple ascending dose study and is recorded as other long term liabilities on the balance sheet at December 31, 2016. Additionally, costs for CERC-501 increased by $1.6 million, driven by the costs incurred in 2016 related to the enrollment activity and costs to complete our Phase 2 clinical trial for smoking cessation, which was completed in December. These costs were offset by $1.0 million of costs incurred in the 2015 period related to the in-licensing of CERC-501. Costs for CERC-301 decreased by $220,000 due to start-up costs incurred in 2015 to initiate our Phase 2 clinical trial for the adjunctive treatment of MDD, offset by 2016 costs related to the enrollment activity and costs to complete the trial, which was completed in November.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nThe following table summarizes our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 331: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaries, benefits and related costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Legal, consulting and other professional expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,806\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,554\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>328\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>480\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $2.7 million compared to the 2015 period. Legal, consulting and other professional expenses increased by $1.5 million, attributable primarily to audit, legal and other costs resulting from becoming a public company in October 2015, as well as certain financing expenses. Stock-based compensation expense increased by $1.2 million, driven by the modification of grants made to our former chief executive officer in the first quarter of 2016 in which the exercise term was extended, as well as the grant of additional awards in 2016 to our directors, executive officers and other employees. Further, other general and administrative expenses increased by $321,000 due to business development expenses and other costs. These increases were offset by a $404,000 decrease in salaries, benefits and related costs, driven by the $528,000 of severance expense recorded in 2015 due to the resignation of our former chief executive officer, offset by salary increases effected at the close of our initial public offering in October 2015.\nChange in Fair Value of Warrant Liability, Unit Purchase Option Liability and Investor Rights Obligation\nWe recognized a gain on the change in fair value of our warrant liability, UPO liability and investor rights obligation of $73,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to a gain of $1.3 million during the 2015 period. The $73,000 gain on the change in fair value during the year ended December 31, 2016 was due to the decrease in fair value of our warrant liability and UPO liability, both attributable to the decrease in our common stock price at December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015.\nThe $1.3 million gain on the change in fair value during the 2015 period resulted from the expiration of the investor rights obligation in October 2015 upon the closing of our initial public offering.\nInterest Expense, Net\nNet interest expense decreased by $329,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in interest associated with a reduction in the principal balance of our secured term loan facility.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nResearch and Development Expenses\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 332: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CERC-301\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CERC-501\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>COMTi\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>761\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FP01\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Internal expenses not allocated to programs:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaries, benefits and related costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,277\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>202\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>262\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,587\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses were $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $5.7 million compared to the 2014 period. This decrease resulted from a $5.6 million decrease in external research and development costs for CERC-301. A Phase 2 clinical trial for CERC-301 was completed in 2014 and, due to the failed results in an 8 mg study for CERC-301, we initiated a second Phase 2 trial later in 2015, increasing the dosage. External research and development costs for COMTi also decreased in 2015 by $501,000 due to a reduction in preclinical trial activity. There was also a decrease of $910,000 in salaries, benefits and related costs due to a reduction in headcount. These decreases were offset by the in-licensing of CERC-501 in February 2015 for $1.1 million and an additional $0.4 million in development costs for CERC-501 thereafter.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nThe following table summarizes our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 333: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaries, benefits and related costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,619\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Legal, consulting and other professional expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,776\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>328\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>885\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>480\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>595\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $452,000 compared to the 2014 period. Stock-based compensation expense decreased by $557,000 due to certain awards to board members and company executives made in 2014 that were fully vested at the time of the award. Legal, consulting and other professional expenses decreased by $487,000, driven by the write-off of deferred offering costs in 2014 of $1.1 million when we had determined that our initial public offering was no longer probable of being consummated at such time, offset by increases in board member fees, directors' and officers' insurance expense, recruiting expense, accounting and audit fees, legal fees and consulting expenses totaling $0.6 million, primarily a result of becoming a public company in 2015. Salaries, benefits and related costs increased by $707,000, which was driven by $528,000 of severance expense recorded in 2015 due to the resignation of our former chief executive officer.\nChange in Fair Value of Warrant Liability and Investor Rights Obligation\nWe recognized a gain on the change in fair value of our warrant liability, UPO liability and Investor Rights Obligation of $1.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to a gain of $2.3 million during the 2014 period. The $1.3 million gain on the change in fair value in 2015 was driven by the expiration of the investor rights obligation in October 2015 upon the closing of our initial public offering.\nThe $2.3 million gain on the change in fair value in 2014 was driven by the issuance of warrants for shares of Series B convertible preferred stock and the investor rights obligation and their respective changes in fair value during the year due to the gain recognized from marking the warrants for shares of Series A-1 convertible preferred stock to market.\nInterest Expense, Net\nNet interest expense decreased by $413,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily due to the interest on the convertible promissory notes and demand notes we entered into in 2014. The convertible promissory notes and demand notes converted to Series B convertible preferred stock upon the completion of the Series B convertible preferred stock equity offering, and as such there was no comparable expense in 2015. This was offset by an increase in interest expense under our secured term loan facility that was entered into in August 2014.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have devoted most of our cash resources to research and development and general and administrative activities. Since our inception, we have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from our operations. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue the development and clinical trials of, and seek marketing approval for, our product candidates. We incurred net losses of $16.5 million, $10.5 million and $16.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. At December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $70.0 million, net working capital of $1.4 million and cash and cash equivalents of $5.1 million. To date, we have not generated any revenues from the sale of products and we do not anticipate generating any revenues from the sale of our product candidates for the foreseeable future. Historically, we have financed our operations principally through private placements of common and convertible preferred stock, convertible and nonconvertible debt, as well as our IPO in October 2015.\nWe will require substantial additional financing to fund our operations beyond the short term and to continue to execute our strategy. Further development of our product candidates will not be possible unless we secure additional funding. Our strategy is to seek funding for our operations from further offerings of equity or debt securities, non-dilutive financing arrangements such as federal grants, collaboration agreements or out-licensing arrangements, and to explore strategic alternatives such as an acquisition, merger, or business combination. Based on our current research and development plans we\nexpect that our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements well into the second quarter of 2017. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date that our financial statements were issued.\nTerm Loan\nIn August 2014, we received a $7.5 million secured term loan from a finance company. The loan is secured by a lien on our assets, excluding intellectual property, which is subject to a negative pledge. The loan contains certain additional nonfinancial covenants. In connection with the loan agreement, our cash and investment accounts are subject to account control agreements with the finance company that give the finance company the right to assume control of the accounts in the event of a loan default. Loan defaults are defined in the loan agreement and include, among others, the finance company's determination that there is a material adverse change in our operations, notwithstanding adverse results of clinical trials. Interest on the loan is at a rate of the greater of 7.95%, or 7.95% plus the prime rate as reported in The Wall Street Journal minus 3.25%. The interest rate effective from loan inception to December 16, 2015 was 7.95%. Effective December 17, 2015, the prime rate as reported by The Wall Street Journal increased 0.25% resulting in the interest rate increasing to 8.20%. Effective December 15, 2016, the prime rate as reported by The Wall Street Journal increased another 0.25% resulting in an increase to the interest rate, which was 8.45% as of December 31, 2016. The loan was interest-only for nine months, and is repayable in equal monthly payments of principal and interest of approximately $305,000 over 27 months, which began in June 2015. The loan terminates in the third quarter of 2017 and has an outstanding balance as of December 31, 2016 of $2.4 million.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 334: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(14,573\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10,163\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(15,518\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(35\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,426\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(16,034\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash used in operating activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $14.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and consisted primarily of a net loss of $16.5 million, offset by non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $1.7 million, non-cash interest expense of $162,000 and an increase in accounts payable of $332,000.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and consisted primarily of a net loss of $10.5 million, a non-cash $1.3 million gain on the change in fair value of the warrant liability, UPO liability and Investor Rights Obligation driven by the expiration of the Investor Rights Obligation during the year and a decrease in accounts payable of $269,000. These were offset by a $1.1 million increase in accrued expenses due to increased clinical trial activities and $528,000 of accrued severance expense due to the resignation of our former chief executive officer, non-cash stock compensation expense of $395,000 and non-cash interest expense of $294,000.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $15.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and consisted primarily of a net loss of $16.1 million, a non-cash $2.3 million gain on the change in fair value of the warrant liability and investor rights obligation and a decrease in accounts payable of $708,000. These were offset by non-cash stock compensation expense of $1.1 million, the write off of deferred public offering costs of $1.1 million, non-cash interest expense of $1.0 million and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $354,000.\nNet cash used in investing activities\nNet cash used in investing activities is limited to purchases of property and equipment consisting of computers and software and furniture and equipment. Our net cash used in investing activities was $35,000, $20,000, and $20,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which consisted of principal payments on our term loan of $3.3 million offset by net proceeds from the sale of common stock to Aspire Capital under the Purchase Agreement of $1.9 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $19.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and consisted primarily of proceeds from our initial public offering including the over-allotment option, net of underwriting discounts, commissions and expenses of $23.7 million, offset by the payment of offering costs related to the initial public offering of $2.3 million and principal payments on our term loan of $1.8 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $23.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and consisted primarily of proceeds from our convertible debt, demand notes, and Series B convertible preferred stock equity issuance aggregating $17.3 million as well as $7.4 million from our term loan entered into in August 2014. These proceeds were offset by the payment of $0.4 million in financing fees related to the equity and debt financing and $0.4 million for IPO-related deferred offering costs.\nOperating and Capital Expenditure Requirements\nWe have not achieved profitability since our inception and we expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. Following the closing of our IPO in October 2015, we expect to continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we were not previously required to incur as a private company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and the NASDAQ Stock Market, requires public companies to implement specified corporate governance practices that were previously inapplicable to us as a private company. We expect these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. We may also acquire or in-license new product candidates. Based on our research and development plans, we expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements well into the second quarter of 2017, which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date that our financial statements were issued. We will require substantial additional financing to fund our operations and to continue to develop our product candidates. Our strategy is to seek funding for our operations from further offerings of equity or debt securities, non-dilutive financing arrangements such as federal grants, collaboration agreements or out-licensing arrangements, and to explore strategic alternatives such as an acquisition, merger, or business combination\nEach of our product candidates are still in the early stages of clinical and preclinical development and the outcome of these efforts is uncertain. We cannot estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates or whether, or when, we may generate revenue.\nWe will need to raise substantial additional capital in the future to fund our operations and to further develop our product candidates and we anticipate funding our operations from further offerings of equity or debt securities, non-dilutive financing arrangements such as federal grants, collaboration agreements or out-licensing arrangements, and to explore strategic alternatives such as an acquisition, merger, or business combination. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional equity or debt financing, or strategic alternatives, on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing agreements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our product candidates, technologies or future revenue streams or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. There can also be no assurance that the exploration of strategic alternatives will result in any such transaction. Our future capital requirements will depend on many forward-looking factors, including:\n \u2022 the progress and results of the three externally funded clinical trials being conducted for CERC-501 and changes to our development plan with respect to CERC-501, if any; \n \u2022 the progress of and our ability to successfully file an IND with the FDA for CERC-611, the progress and results of any subsequent clinical trials for CERC-611 and any changes to our development plan with respect to CERC-611, if any; \n \u2022 our plan and ability to enter into collaborative agreements for the development and commercialization of our product candidates; \n \u2022 the number and development requirements of any other product candidates that we may pursue; \n \u2022 the scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing our product candidates or any future product candidates, both in the United States and in territories outside the United States; \n \u2022 the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates or any future product candidates, both in the United States and in territories outside the United States; \n \u2022 the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval; \n \u2022 the costs and timing of any product candidate acquisition or in-licensing opportunities; \n \u2022 any product liability or other lawsuits related to our products; \n \u2022 the expenses needed to attract and retain skilled personnel; \n \u2022 the revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval; and \n \u2022 the costs involved in preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending our intellectual property-related claims, both in the United States and in territories outside the United States \nPlease refer to the section entitled Risk Factors\u201d at Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional risks associated with our substantial capital requirements.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following is a summary of our long-term contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 347: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligation(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>one year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 - 3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt obligations(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) This table does not include any contingent milestone or royalty payments that may become payable to third parties under license agreements because the timing and likelihood of such payments are not known. \n (2) Amount represents principal and interest cash payments over the life of the debt obligations, including anticipated interest payments that are not recorded on our balance sheet. \n (3) Operating lease obligations reflect our obligations pursuant to the terms of a lease agreement entered into on August 8, 2013 for our office space located in Baltimore, Maryland. \nWe have also entered into agreements with contract research organizations, or CROs, and other external service providers for services, primarily in connection with the clinical trials and development of our product candidates. We were contractually obligated for up to approximately $1.4 million of future services under these agreements as of December 31, 2016. Our actual contractual obligations will vary depending upon several factors, including the progress and results of the underlying services.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined by applicable SEC rules and regulations.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. The amendments in this update explicitly require a company's management to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued, and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. The new standard is effective in the first annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. We adopted the new guidance in the fourth quarter of 2016. The adoption of this guidance did not impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, nor did it significantly impact our disclosures regarding the assessment of our ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date that our financial statements were issued.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue From Contracts With Customers ( ASU 2014-09\u201d). Pursuant to this update, an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue From Contracts With Customers (Topic 606), which delays the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. As a result, ASU 2014-09 will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) ( ASU 2016-08\u201d) and ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue From Contracts With Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing ( ASU 2016-10\u201d), and in May 2016 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients ( ASU 2016-12\u201d), each of which clarify the guidance in ASU 2014-09 and have the same effective date as the original standard. We have not yet completed our determination of the impact of adopting ASU 2014-09, ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10, or ASU 2016-12 on the financial statements, although, we do not expect the impact, if any, to be significant. We expect to adopt the pronouncement on a full retrospective basis on January 1, 2018.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). This guidance revises existing practice related to accounting for leases under ASC 840, Leases ( ASC 840\u201d) for both lessees and lessors. The new guidance in ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for nearly all leases (other than leases that meet the definition of a short-term lease). The lease liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments and the right-of-use asset will be based on the lease liability, subject to adjustment such as for initial direct costs. For income statement purposes, the new standard retains a dual model similar to ASC 840, requiring leases to be classified as either operating leases or capital leases. For lessees, operating leases will result in straight-line expense (similar to current accounting by lessees for operating leases under ASC 840) while capital leases will result in a front-loaded expense pattern (similar to current accounting by lessees for capital leases under ASC 840). The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of this standard on our financial statements.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The guidance is intended to simplify several areas of accounting for share-based compensation, including income tax impacts, classification on the statement of cash flows and forfeitures. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2017 and its adoption will have no impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Restricted Cash. The guidance is intended to address the diversity that currently exists in the classification and presentation of changes in restricted cash on the statement of cash flows. The new standard requires that entities show the changes in the total of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents on the statement of cash flows and no longer present transfers between cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents on the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of this standard on our financial statements.\nJOBS Act\nThe JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce reporting requirements for an emerging growth company.\u201d As an emerging growth company, we have elected to not take advantage of the extended transition period afforded\nby the JOBS Act for the implementation of new or revised accounting standards and, as a result, will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies.\nInternal Control Over Financial Reporting\nAssessing our staffing and training procedures to improve our internal control over financial reporting is an ongoing process. We are not currently required to comply with all of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. For the year ended December 31, 2016, management is required to make an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as required by Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as further described in Item 9A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act exempts non-accelerated filers from compliance with Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which relates to the independent auditor's attestation on the effectiveness of the issuer's internal control over financial reporting. As such, our independent registered public accounting firm has not been engaged to express, nor have they expressed, an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company that is developing innovative drug candidates to make a difference in the lives of patients with neurological and psychiatric disorders. We have a portfolio of clinical and preclinical compounds that we believe are best in class due to their unique mechanism of action and where human proof of concept has been established for the compound or the target. At December 31, 2016, we had $5.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and $4.3 million in current liabilities. Accordingly, we do not have sufficient funds to finance our continuing operations beyond the short term. We must secure additional financing to further advance any of our product candidates, including our planned initiation of a Phase 2/3 clinical trial with CERC-501 as an adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder, or MDD, in the next year, and our plan to commence Phase 1 development of CERC-611 in 2017. Other than three third-party sponsored trials of CERC-501, we do not have any ongoing clinical trials of our product candidates and we do not currently have the capital to undertake any such trials. We are continuing preclinical development of our preclinical product candidate, CERC-611, but we would require additional funding to advance it into clinical trials.\nCERC-501 is a potent and selective kappa opioid receptor, or KOR, antagonist being developed as an adjunctive treatment of MDD. KORs are believed to play key roles in modulating stress, mood and addictive behaviors, which form the basis of co-occurring disorders. We plan to initiate a Phase 2/3 clinical study in inadequately treated subjects with MDD currently on antidepressants in the next year, subject to the availability of additional funding. Currently, three externally funded clinical trials are being conducted to evaluate the use of CERC-501 in treating depressive symptoms, stress-related smoking relapse and cocaine addiction. One trial is being conducted under the auspices of the National Institute of Mental Health, the second trial is a collaboration between Cerecor and Yale University with funding from the National Institutes of Health and the third trial is being conducted at Rockefeller University Hospital with funding from a private foundation.\nCERC-301 is an oral, NR2B specific N-methyl-D-aspartate, or NMDA, receptor antagonist being developed as an adjunctive treatment of MDD. CERC-301 belongs to a class of compounds known as antagonists, or inhibitors, of the NMDA receptor, a receptor subtype of the glutamate neurotransmitter system that is responsible for controlling neurological adaptation. We believe CERC-301 has the potential to produce a significant reduction in depression symptoms in a matter of days, as compared to weeks or months with conventional therapies, because it specifically blocks the NMDA receptor subunit 2B, or NR2B. We believe this mechanism of action may provide rapid and significant antidepressant activity without the adverse side effect profile of non-selective NMDA receptor antagonists, such as ketamine. We are currently evaluating potential next steps for this program.\nCERC-611 is a potent and selective transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins, or TARP, \u03b3-8-dependent \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor antagonist, which we plan to develop as an adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures, with or without secondarily generalized seizures, in patients with epilepsy. We intend to file an investigational new drug application with the FDA and thereafter commence Phase 1 development in 2017, subject to the availability of additional funding.\nCERC-406 is our lead preclinical candidate from our proprietary platform of compounds that inhibit catechol-O-methyltransferase, or COMT, within the brain, which we refer to as our COMTi platform. We intend to develop CERC-406 for the treatment of residual cognitive impairment symptoms in patients with MDD, subject to the availability of additional funding.\nFurther development of our product candidates will not be possible unless we secure additional funding. Our strategy is to seek funding for our operations from further offerings of equity and debt securities, non-dilutive financing arrangements such as federal grants, collaboration agreements or out-licensing arrangements, and to explore strategic alternatives such as an acquisition, merger, or business combination. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or transactions on favorable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements or\ntransactions in the short term, we will have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development and/or commercialization of one or more of our product candidates or cease our operations altogether.\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in 2011 and commenced operations in the second quarter of 2011. Since inception, our operations have included organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital and developing our product candidates. We have no products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales to date, and we continue to incur significant research, development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. We have incurred losses in each period since our inception. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $70.0 million. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue the development and clinical trials of, and seek marketing approval for, our product candidates. Our recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date that our financial statements were issued, and our ability to continue as a going concern will require us to obtain additional financing to fund our operations.\nWe have financed our operations primarily through a public offering, private placements of our common stock and convertible preferred stock, and the issuance of debt. Our ability to become and remain profitable depends on our ability to generate product revenue. We do not expect to generate any product revenue unless, and until, we obtain marketing approval for, and commercialize, any of our product candidates. There can be no assurance as to whether or when we will achieve profitability.\nRecent Developments\nThe Aspire Capital Transaction\nOn September 8, 2016, we entered into a common stock purchase agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, with Aspire Capital Fund, LLC, or Aspire Capital, pursuant to which Aspire Capital committed to purchase up to an aggregate of $15.0 million of shares of our common stock over the 30-month term of the Purchase Agreement. Upon execution of the Purchase Agreement, we issued and sold to Aspire Capital 250,000 shares of common stock at a price per share of $4.00, for gross proceeds of $1.0 million. Additionally, as consideration for Aspire Capital entering into the Purchase Agreement, we issued 175,000 shares of common stock as a commitment fee. The net proceeds of the Aspire Capital transaction, after offering expenses, were approximately $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, we had sold 763,998 shares of common stock to Aspire Capital. Subsequent to December 31, 2016, we sold an additional 965,165 shares of common stock to Aspire Capital under the terms of the Purchase Agreement for gross proceeds of approximately $789,000. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we may not issue additional shares of common stock to Aspire Capital under the Purchase Agreement unless shareholder approval to issue additional shares is obtained.\nThe Maxim Group Equity Distribution Agreement\nOn January 27, 2017, we entered into an equity distribution agreement, or the Equity Distribution Agreement, with Maxim Group LLC, or Maxim, as sales agent, pursuant to which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock through Maxim from time to time. We have no obligation to sell any of the shares, and may at any time suspend offers under the Equity Distribution Agreement.\nAs of the date of this filing, we had sold 345,653 shares of our common stock through Maxim under the Equity Distribution Agreement for gross proceeds of $287,000. Immediately after we file this Annual Report on Form 10-K we expect that the amount of additional securities we will be able to sell under the registration statement on Form S-3 will be approximately $3.3 million.\nEngagement of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey to Assist with Review of Strategic Alternatives\nOn February 7, 2017, we announced the engagement of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., or SunTrust, as our exclusive financial advisor to assist with our ongoing process to explore and review a range of strategic alternatives focused on maximizing stockholder value. Potential strategic alternatives that may be explored or evaluated as part of this process include an acquisition, merger, business combination or other strategic transaction. We have not made a decision to pursue any specific transaction or other strategic alternative, and there can be no assurance that this ongoing process will result in any such transaction.\nComponents of Operating Results\nRevenue\nTo date, we have derived all of our revenue from research grants from the National Institutes of Health. We have not generated any revenue from commercial product sales to date. We will not generate any commercial revenue, if ever, until one of our product candidates receives marketing approval and we successfully commercialize such product candidate.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOur research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred acquiring, developing, testing and seeking marketing approval for our product candidates. These costs include both external costs, which are study-specific costs, and internal research and development costs, which are not directly allocated to our product candidates.\nExternal costs include:\n \u2022 expenses incurred under agreements with third-party contract research organizations, or CROs, and investigative sites that conduct our clinical trials, preclinical studies and regulatory activities; \n \u2022 payments made to contract manufacturers for drug substance and acquiring, developing and manufacturing clinical trial materials; and \n \u2022 payments related to acquisitions of our product candidates and preclinical platform and milestone payments. \nInternal costs include:\n \u2022 personnel-related expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense; \n \u2022 consulting costs related to our internal research and development programs; \n \u2022 allocated facilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include rent and utilities, as well as other supplies; and \n \u2022 product liability insurance. \nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. We record costs for some development activities, such as clinical trials, based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as subject enrollment, clinical site activations or information provided to us by our vendors.\nWe track external costs by discovery program and subsequently by product candidate once a product candidate has been selected for development. Product candidates in later stage clinical development generally have higher research and development expenses than those in earlier stages of development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of the clinical trials.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had eight full-time employees who were primarily engaged in research and development. We expect our research and development expenses to decrease significantly in 2017, unless the necessary capital is raised to fund the further development of our product candidates.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of professional fees, patent costs and salaries, benefits and related costs for executive and other personnel, including stock-based compensation and travel expenses. Other general and administrative expenses include facility-related costs, communication expenses and professional fees for legal, including patent-related expenses, consulting, tax and accounting services, insurance, depreciation and general corporate expenses. We expect our general and administrative expenses to decrease in 2017.\nChange in Fair Value of Warrant Liability, Unit Purchase Option Liability and Investor Rights Obligation\nIn connection with the issuance of our term debt facility in August 2014, we issued warrants to purchase 625,208 shares of Series B convertible preferred stock. Upon the closing of our initial public offering, or IPO, in October 2015 these warrants became warrants to purchase 22,328 shares of common stock, in accordance with their terms. These warrants represent a freestanding financial instrument that is indexed to an obligation, which we refer to as the Warrant Liability. These\nwarrants are classified as a liability at fair value. This liability is remeasured at each balance sheet date and the change in fair value is recorded within our statement of operations.\nAs part of our IPO, the underwriter received a unit purchase option, or UPO, to purchase up to 40,000 units, whereby a unit is comprised of one share of our common stock, one Class A warrant to purchase one share of our common stock and one Class B warrant to purchase one-half share of our common stock. The UPO is classified as a liability at its respective fair value. This liability is remeasured at each balance sheet date and the change in fair value is recorded within our statement of operations.\nOur obligation to issue additional shares of our Series B preferred stock as part of the Series B preferred stock offering was accounted for as a freestanding financial instrument, which we referred to as the Investor Rights Obligation. The Investor Rights Obligation expired upon the closing of our IPO in accordance with its terms, and the related liability was reduced to zero at that time.\nInterest Expense, net\nNet interest expense is primarily related to interest payments pursuant to the terms of our term debt facility entered into in August 2014, as well as the amortization of the debt discounts and premiums and deferred financing fees in connection with such term debt facility.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period. In accordance with GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those related to clinical and preclinical trial expenses and stock-based compensation. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to the audited financial statements appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results. We have reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors.\nGrant Revenue Recognition\nWe recognize grant revenue when there is (i) reasonable assurance of compliance with the conditions of the grant and (ii) reasonable assurance that the grant will be received. We recognize revenue under grants in earnings on a systemic basis in the period the related expenditures for which the grants are intended to compensate are incurred.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. We rely heavily on third parties to conduct preclinical and clinical trials, as well as for the manufacture of our clinical trial supplies. Costs for certain development activities, such as clinical trials, are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as subject enrollment, clinical site activations or information provided to us by our vendors with respect to their actual costs incurred. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual arrangements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and are reflected in the financial statements as prepaid or accrued research and development expense, as the case may be.\nIncome Taxes\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $52.2 million of federal and Maryland state net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards that will begin to expire in 2031. As of December 31, 2016, we had $1.8 million and $57,000 of federal and Maryland State research and development credits, respectively, that will begin to expire in 2018. The NOL and research and development credit carryforwards are subject to review and possible adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service and state tax authorities. NOL and tax credit carryforwards may become subject to an annual limitation in the event of certain cumulative\nchanges in the ownership interest of significant shareholders over a three-year period in excess of 50%, as defined under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, as well as similar state tax provisions. This could limit the amount of NOLs that we can utilize annually to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities. We have not analyzed the historical or potential impact of our equity financings on beneficial ownership and therefore no determination has been made whether the NOL carryforwards are subject to any Internal Revenue Code Section 382 limitation. To the extent there is a limitation, there would be a reduction in the deferred tax asset with an offsetting reduction in the valuation allowance. Subsequent ownership changes may further affect the limitation in future years. All of our tax years are currently open to examination by each tax jurisdiction in which we are subject to taxation.\nEstimated Fair Value of Warrants, Unit Purchase Option and Investor Rights Obligation\nWarrants for shares that are contingently redeemable are accounted for as freestanding financial instruments. These warrants are classified as liabilities on our balance sheet and are recorded at their estimated fair value. At the end of each reporting period, changes in the estimated fair value during the period are recorded as a component of other income (expense), net. We will continue to adjust these liabilities for changes in fair value until the earlier of the expiration or the exercise of the warrants. We estimate the fair value of these warrants using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The significant assumptions used in preparing the option-pricing model for valuing the warrants as of December 31, 2016, included (i) volatility of 100%, (ii) risk free interest rate of 1.65%, (iii) strike price ($8.40), (iv) fair value of common stock ($0.88), and (v) expected life of 3.8 years. Significant decreases in our stock price volatility will significantly decrease the overall valuation of the warrants, while significant increases in our stock price volatility will significantly increase the overall valuation.\nAs part of our IPO we offered our underwriters the UPO to purchase up to an additional 40,000 units. The UPO is accounted for as a freestanding financial instrument and is recorded a liability on our balance sheet at its estimated fair value. At the end of each reporting period, the change in the estimated fair value during the period is recorded as component of other income (expense), net. We will continue to adjust this liability for changes in fair value until the earlier of expiration or the exercise of the UPO. We estimate the fair value of the UPO using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model within a Monte Carlo simulation model framework. The significant assumptions used in preparing the simulation model for valuing the UPO as of December 31, 2016, include (i) volatility range of 65% to 90%, (ii) risk free interest rate range of 0.44% to 1.64%, (iii) unit strike price ($7.48), (iv) underwriters' Class A warrant strike price ($5.23), (v) underwriters' Class B warrant strike price ($4.49), (vi) fair value of underlying equity ($0.88), and (vii) optimal exercise point of immediately prior to the expiration of the underwriters' Class B warrants, which occurs on April 20, 2017. Significant decreases in our stock price and our stock price volatility will significantly decrease the overall valuation of the UPO, while significant increases in our stock price and our stock price volatility will significantly increase the overall valuation.\nOur obligation to issue additional shares of our common stock arising from the 2014 Series B preferred stock offering, or the Investor Rights Obligation, was accounted for as a freestanding financial instrument. This obligation was classified as a liability on our balance sheet and was recorded at its estimated fair value. At the end of each reporting period, the change in the estimated fair value during the period was recorded as a component of other income (expense), net on the statement of operations. The Investor Rights Obligation expired upon the closing of our IPO in October 2015 in accordance with its terms, and the related liability was reduced to zero at that time.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure stock-based awards granted to our employees and nonemployee directors at fair value on the date of grant and recognize the corresponding compensation expense of those awards, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. Generally, we issue stock options and restricted stock with only service-based vesting conditions and record the expense for these awards using the straight-line method.\nWe measure stock-based awards granted to nonemployee consultants at the fair value of the award on the date at which the related service is complete. Expense is recognized over the period during which services are rendered by such nonemployee consultants until completed. At the end of each financial reporting period prior to the completion of the service, the fair value of these awards is re-measured using the then-current fair market value of our common stock and updated assumptions in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.\nThe fair value of each stock option grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. We estimate our expected volatility based on the historical volatility of our publicly traded peer companies and expect to continue to do so until such time as we have adequate historical data regarding the volatility of our traded stock price. Due to the lack of sufficient historical data for the term of our options, the expected term of our options granted to employees and non-employee directors has been estimated as the arithmetic average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option, while the\nexpected term of our options granted to consultants and nonemployees has been determined based on the contractual term of the options. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the United States Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nThe assumptions we used to determine the fair value of stock options granted to employees and nonemployee directors are as follows:\n\nThe estimates involved in the valuations include inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates when valuing our stock options, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different. We recognize compensation expense for only the portion of awards that are expected to vest. In developing a forfeiture rate estimate for pre-vesting forfeitures, we have considered our historical experience of actual forfeitures. If our future actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, our stock-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period.\nDetermination of the Fair Market Value of Common Stock\nWe considered numerous objective and subjective factors in the assessment of fair value of its common stock for grants made prior to the date our common stock began trading separately on the NASDAQ Capital Market, which was November 13, 2015 and includes all grants made from inception through November 9, 2015. The factors considered included the price for our convertible preferred stock that was sold to investors and the rights, preferences and privileges of our convertible preferred stock and common stock, the trading price of our units between the IPO date and November 13, 2015, our financial condition and results of operations during the relevant periods, including the status of the development of our product candidates, and the status of strategic initiatives. These estimates involve a significant level of judgment.\nIn the absence of a public trading market for our common stock prior to our initial public offering, our board of directors determined the fair market value of our common stock at various dates, with input from management, considering our most recently available third-party valuations of common stock and its assessment of additional objective and subjective factors that it believed were relevant and which may have changed from the date of the most recent valuation through the date of the grant.\nIn valuing our common stock prior to our initial public offering, the board of directors determined the equity value of our business by considering a number of valuation approaches and allocation methodologies. Valuation techniques considered included the Current Value Method, the Probability-Weighted Expected Return Method, or PWERM, the Option Pricing Method, or OPM, and the Hybrid Method. Given the range of possible financing and exit events that existed at the time we completed our valuations, which was prior to our initial public offering, we concluded the PWERM to be the most appropriate for purposes of valuing our common stock given our expected time to a liquidity event, subjectivity with regards to estimating possible proceeds from a future liquidation event and subjectivity with regards to the ability to estimate the probability of an IPO, sale or other financing events. The PWERM explicitly considered the various terms of our investor related documents, including various rights of each class of our stock, at the date of the liquidity event when those rights would either be executed or abandoned. Under the PWERM, the value of each class of our stock was estimated using a probability-weighted analysis of the present value of the returns afforded to our stockholders under each of the possible future exit scenarios. The scenarios included within the PWERM analysis included IPOs, a sale transaction, remaining private and dissolution.\nDiscrete future outcomes considered under the PWERM included non-IPO market based outcomes as well as IPO scenarios. In the non-IPO scenarios, a large portion of the equity value was allocated to the preferred stock to incorporate higher aggregate liquidation preferences. In the IPO scenarios, the equity value was allocated pro rata among the shares of common stock and each series of preferred stock, which caused the common stock to have a higher relative value per share than under the non-IPO scenario. The fair value of the enterprise determined using the IPO and non-IPO scenarios was\nweighted according to the board of directors' estimate of the probability of each scenario at the time the valuation was completed.\nWe have periodically determined the fair market value of our common stock at various dates using contemporaneous valuations performed in accordance with the guidance outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' Accounting and Valuation Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. Our common stock valuations were performed using a hybrid method, which used market approaches to determine our enterprise value. The hybrid method is a probability-weighted expected return method where the equity value in one or more of the scenarios is calculated using an option-pricing method. We selected the method based on availability and the quality of information to develop the assumptions for the methodology. We performed these contemporaneous valuations, with the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist, as of July 11, 2014, December 31, 2014, March 31, 2015, June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2015. In addition, our board of directors considered various objective and subjective factors, along with input from management, to determine the fair market value of our common stock as of each grant date, including the following:\n \u2022 prices at which we sold shares of our preferred stock and the superior rights and preferences of our preferred stock relative to our common stock; \n \u2022 the progress of our research and development programs, including the status of non-clinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates; \n \u2022 our stage of development and commercialization and our business strategy; \n \u2022 our financial condition, including cash on hand; \n \u2022 our historical and forecasted performance and operating results; \n \u2022 the composition of, and changes to, our management team and board of directors; \n \u2022 the lack of an active public market for our common stock and our preferred stock; \n \u2022 the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as a sale of our company or an initial public offering, or IPO, given prevailing market conditions; \n \u2022 the analysis of IPOs and the market performance of similar companies in the biopharmaceutical industry; \n \u2022 external market conditions affecting the biopharmaceutical industry; and \n \u2022 trends within the biopharmaceutical industry. \nThe assumptions underlying these valuations represent management's determinations, which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors or expected outcomes change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates, our equity-based compensation could be materially different.\nThe following table summarizes by grant date the number of shares subject to options granted since January 1, 2014, the per share exercise price of the options, the fair market value of common stock underlying the options on date of grant and the per share fair value of the options:\n\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nGrant Revenue\nThe following table summarizes our grant revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\n\nGrant revenue was $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and was comprised of revenue from two research and development grants awarded during the year. In April 2016, we were awarded a research and development grant of $1.02 million from the National Institute on Drug Abuse at the National Institutes of Health, or the NIDA Grant. This grant provided additional resources for the completed Phase 2 clinical trial of CERC-501. In July 2016, we were awarded a research and development grant of approximately $1.0 million from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism at the National Institutes of Health, or the NIAAA Grant. This grant provides additional resources to progress the development of CERC-501 for the treatment of alcohol use disorder. For the year ended December 31, 2016, grant revenue recognized from the NIDA Grant was $1.02 million and grant revenue recognized from the NIAAA Grant was $132,000. We did not have grant revenue in the 2015 period.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\n\nResearch and development expenses were $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $3.6 million compared to the 2015 period. This increase was largely due to the $2.0 million total upfront payment recorded in connection with the license of CERC-611 in September 2016, of which $750,000 was due and paid within 30 days of the effective date of the license agreement. The remaining balance of $1.25 million is due after the first subject is dosed with CERC-611 in a multiple ascending dose study and is recorded as other long term liabilities on the balance sheet at December 31, 2016. Additionally, costs for CERC-501 increased by $1.6 million, driven by the costs incurred in 2016 related to the enrollment activity and costs to complete our Phase 2 clinical trial for smoking cessation, which was completed in December. These costs were offset by $1.0 million of costs incurred in the 2015 period related to the in-licensing of CERC-501. Costs for CERC-301 decreased by $220,000 due to start-up costs incurred in 2015 to initiate our Phase 2 clinical trial for the adjunctive treatment of MDD, offset by 2016 costs related to the enrollment activity and costs to complete the trial, which was completed in November.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nThe following table summarizes our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $2.7 million compared to the 2015 period. Legal, consulting and other professional expenses increased by $1.5 million, attributable primarily to audit, legal and other costs resulting from becoming a public company in October 2015, as well as certain financing expenses. Stock-based compensation expense increased by $1.2 million, driven by the modification of grants made to our former chief executive officer in the first quarter of 2016 in which the exercise term was extended, as well as the grant of additional awards in 2016 to our directors, executive officers and other employees. Further, other general and administrative expenses increased by $321,000 due to business development expenses and other costs. These increases were offset by a $404,000 decrease in salaries, benefits and related costs, driven by the $528,000 of severance expense recorded in 2015 due to the resignation of our former chief executive officer, offset by salary increases effected at the close of our initial public offering in October 2015.\nChange in Fair Value of Warrant Liability, Unit Purchase Option Liability and Investor Rights Obligation\nWe recognized a gain on the change in fair value of our warrant liability, UPO liability and investor rights obligation of $73,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to a gain of $1.3 million during the 2015 period. The $73,000 gain on the change in fair value during the year ended December 31, 2016 was due to the decrease in fair value of our warrant liability and UPO liability, both attributable to the decrease in our common stock price at December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015.\nThe $1.3 million gain on the change in fair value during the 2015 period resulted from the expiration of the investor rights obligation in October 2015 upon the closing of our initial public offering.\nInterest Expense, Net\nNet interest expense decreased by $329,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in interest associated with a reduction in the principal balance of our secured term loan facility.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nResearch and Development Expenses\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\n\nResearch and development expenses were $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $5.7 million compared to the 2014 period. This decrease resulted from a $5.6 million decrease in external research and development costs for CERC-301. A Phase 2 clinical trial for CERC-301 was completed in 2014 and, due to the failed results in an 8 mg study for CERC-301, we initiated a second Phase 2 trial later in 2015, increasing the dosage. External research and development costs for COMTi also decreased in 2015 by $501,000 due to a reduction in preclinical trial activity. There was also a decrease of $910,000 in salaries, benefits and related costs due to a reduction in headcount. These decreases were offset by the in-licensing of CERC-501 in February 2015 for $1.1 million and an additional $0.4 million in development costs for CERC-501 thereafter.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nThe following table summarizes our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $452,000 compared to the 2014 period. Stock-based compensation expense decreased by $557,000 due to certain awards to board members and company executives made in 2014 that were fully vested at the time of the award. Legal, consulting and other professional expenses decreased by $487,000, driven by the write-off of deferred offering costs in 2014 of $1.1 million when we had determined that our initial public offering was no longer probable of being consummated at such time, offset by increases in board member fees, directors' and officers' insurance expense, recruiting expense, accounting and audit fees, legal fees and consulting expenses totaling $0.6 million, primarily a result of becoming a public company in 2015. Salaries, benefits and related costs increased by $707,000, which was driven by $528,000 of severance expense recorded in 2015 due to the resignation of our former chief executive officer.\nChange in Fair Value of Warrant Liability and Investor Rights Obligation\nWe recognized a gain on the change in fair value of our warrant liability, UPO liability and Investor Rights Obligation of $1.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to a gain of $2.3 million during the 2014 period. The $1.3 million gain on the change in fair value in 2015 was driven by the expiration of the investor rights obligation in October 2015 upon the closing of our initial public offering.\nThe $2.3 million gain on the change in fair value in 2014 was driven by the issuance of warrants for shares of Series B convertible preferred stock and the investor rights obligation and their respective changes in fair value during the year due to the gain recognized from marking the warrants for shares of Series A-1 convertible preferred stock to market.\nInterest Expense, Net\nNet interest expense decreased by $413,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily due to the interest on the convertible promissory notes and demand notes we entered into in 2014. The convertible promissory notes and demand notes converted to Series B convertible preferred stock upon the completion of the Series B convertible preferred stock equity offering, and as such there was no comparable expense in 2015. This was offset by an increase in interest expense under our secured term loan facility that was entered into in August 2014.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have devoted most of our cash resources to research and development and general and administrative activities. Since our inception, we have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from our operations. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue the development and clinical trials of, and seek marketing approval for, our product candidates. We incurred net losses of $16.5 million, $10.5 million and $16.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. At December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $70.0 million, net working capital of $1.4 million and cash and cash equivalents of $5.1 million. To date, we have not generated any revenues from the sale of products and we do not anticipate generating any revenues from the sale of our product candidates for the foreseeable future. Historically, we have financed our operations principally through private placements of common and convertible preferred stock, convertible and nonconvertible debt, as well as our IPO in October 2015.\nWe will require substantial additional financing to fund our operations beyond the short term and to continue to execute our strategy. Further development of our product candidates will not be possible unless we secure additional funding. Our strategy is to seek funding for our operations from further offerings of equity or debt securities, non-dilutive financing arrangements such as federal grants, collaboration agreements or out-licensing arrangements, and to explore strategic alternatives such as an acquisition, merger, or business combination. Based on our current research and development plans we\nexpect that our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements well into the second quarter of 2017. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date that our financial statements were issued.\nTerm Loan\nIn August 2014, we received a $7.5 million secured term loan from a finance company. The loan is secured by a lien on our assets, excluding intellectual property, which is subject to a negative pledge. The loan contains certain additional nonfinancial covenants. In connection with the loan agreement, our cash and investment accounts are subject to account control agreements with the finance company that give the finance company the right to assume control of the accounts in the event of a loan default. Loan defaults are defined in the loan agreement and include, among others, the finance company's determination that there is a material adverse change in our operations, notwithstanding adverse results of clinical trials. Interest on the loan is at a rate of the greater of 7.95%, or 7.95% plus the prime rate as reported in The Wall Street Journal minus 3.25%. The interest rate effective from loan inception to December 16, 2015 was 7.95%. Effective December 17, 2015, the prime rate as reported by The Wall Street Journal increased 0.25% resulting in the interest rate increasing to 8.20%. Effective December 15, 2016, the prime rate as reported by The Wall Street Journal increased another 0.25% resulting in an increase to the interest rate, which was 8.45% as of December 31, 2016. The loan was interest-only for nine months, and is repayable in equal monthly payments of principal and interest of approximately $305,000 over 27 months, which began in June 2015. The loan terminates in the third quarter of 2017 and has an outstanding balance as of December 31, 2016 of $2.4 million.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\n\nNet cash used in operating activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $14.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and consisted primarily of a net loss of $16.5 million, offset by non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $1.7 million, non-cash interest expense of $162,000 and an increase in accounts payable of $332,000.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and consisted primarily of a net loss of $10.5 million, a non-cash $1.3 million gain on the change in fair value of the warrant liability, UPO liability and Investor Rights Obligation driven by the expiration of the Investor Rights Obligation during the year and a decrease in accounts payable of $269,000. These were offset by a $1.1 million increase in accrued expenses due to increased clinical trial activities and $528,000 of accrued severance expense due to the resignation of our former chief executive officer, non-cash stock compensation expense of $395,000 and non-cash interest expense of $294,000.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $15.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and consisted primarily of a net loss of $16.1 million, a non-cash $2.3 million gain on the change in fair value of the warrant liability and investor rights obligation and a decrease in accounts payable of $708,000. These were offset by non-cash stock compensation expense of $1.1 million, the write off of deferred public offering costs of $1.1 million, non-cash interest expense of $1.0 million and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $354,000.\nNet cash used in investing activities\nNet cash used in investing activities is limited to purchases of property and equipment consisting of computers and software and furniture and equipment. Our net cash used in investing activities was $35,000, $20,000, and $20,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which consisted of principal payments on our term loan of $3.3 million offset by net proceeds from the sale of common stock to Aspire Capital under the Purchase Agreement of $1.9 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $19.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and consisted primarily of proceeds from our initial public offering including the over-allotment option, net of underwriting discounts, commissions and expenses of $23.7 million, offset by the payment of offering costs related to the initial public offering of $2.3 million and principal payments on our term loan of $1.8 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $23.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and consisted primarily of proceeds from our convertible debt, demand notes, and Series B convertible preferred stock equity issuance aggregating $17.3 million as well as $7.4 million from our term loan entered into in August 2014. These proceeds were offset by the payment of $0.4 million in financing fees related to the equity and debt financing and $0.4 million for IPO-related deferred offering costs.\nOperating and Capital Expenditure Requirements\nWe have not achieved profitability since our inception and we expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. Following the closing of our IPO in October 2015, we expect to continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we were not previously required to incur as a private company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and the NASDAQ Stock Market, requires public companies to implement specified corporate governance practices that were previously inapplicable to us as a private company. We expect these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. We may also acquire or in-license new product candidates. Based on our research and development plans, we expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements well into the second quarter of 2017, which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date that our financial statements were issued. We will require substantial additional financing to fund our operations and to continue to develop our product candidates. Our strategy is to seek funding for our operations from further offerings of equity or debt securities, non-dilutive financing arrangements such as federal grants, collaboration agreements or out-licensing arrangements, and to explore strategic alternatives such as an acquisition, merger, or business combination\nEach of our product candidates are still in the early stages of clinical and preclinical development and the outcome of these efforts is uncertain. We cannot estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates or whether, or when, we may generate revenue.\nWe will need to raise substantial additional capital in the future to fund our operations and to further develop our product candidates and we anticipate funding our operations from further offerings of equity or debt securities, non-dilutive financing arrangements such as federal grants, collaboration agreements or out-licensing arrangements, and to explore strategic alternatives such as an acquisition, merger, or business combination. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional equity or debt financing, or strategic alternatives, on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing agreements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our product candidates, technologies or future revenue streams or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. There can also be no assurance that the exploration of strategic alternatives will result in any such transaction. Our future capital requirements will depend on many forward-looking factors, including:\n \u2022 the progress and results of the three externally funded clinical trials being conducted for CERC-501 and changes to our development plan with respect to CERC-501, if any; \n \u2022 the progress of and our ability to successfully file an IND with the FDA for CERC-611, the progress and results of any subsequent clinical trials for CERC-611 and any changes to our development plan with respect to CERC-611, if any; \n \u2022 our plan and ability to enter into collaborative agreements for the development and commercialization of our product candidates; \n \u2022 the number and development requirements of any other product candidates that we may pursue; \n \u2022 the scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing our product candidates or any future product candidates, both in the United States and in territories outside the United States; \n \u2022 the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates or any future product candidates, both in the United States and in territories outside the United States; \n \u2022 the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval; \n \u2022 the costs and timing of any product candidate acquisition or in-licensing opportunities; \n \u2022 any product liability or other lawsuits related to our products; \n \u2022 the expenses needed to attract and retain skilled personnel; \n \u2022 the revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval; and \n \u2022 the costs involved in preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending our intellectual property-related claims, both in the United States and in territories outside the United States \nPlease refer to the section entitled Risk Factors\u201d at Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional risks associated with our substantial capital requirements.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following is a summary of our long-term contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2016 (in thousands):\n\n (1) This table does not include any contingent milestone or royalty payments that may become payable to third parties under license agreements because the timing and likelihood of such payments are not known. \n (2) Amount represents principal and interest cash payments over the life of the debt obligations, including anticipated interest payments that are not recorded on our balance sheet. \n (3) Operating lease obligations reflect our obligations pursuant to the terms of a lease agreement entered into on August 8, 2013 for our office space located in Baltimore, Maryland. \nWe have also entered into agreements with contract research organizations, or CROs, and other external service providers for services, primarily in connection with the clinical trials and development of our product candidates. We were contractually obligated for up to approximately $1.4 million of future services under these agreements as of December 31, 2016. Our actual contractual obligations will vary depending upon several factors, including the progress and results of the underlying services.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined by applicable SEC rules and regulations.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. The amendments in this update explicitly require a company's management to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued, and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. The new standard is effective in the first annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. We adopted the new guidance in the fourth quarter of 2016. The adoption of this guidance did not impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, nor did it significantly impact our disclosures regarding the assessment of our ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date that our financial statements were issued.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue From Contracts With Customers ( ASU 2014-09\u201d). Pursuant to this update, an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue From Contracts With Customers (Topic 606), which delays the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. As a result, ASU 2014-09 will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) ( ASU 2016-08\u201d) and ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue From Contracts With Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing ( ASU 2016-10\u201d), and in May 2016 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients ( ASU 2016-12\u201d), each of which clarify the guidance in ASU 2014-09 and have the same effective date as the original standard. We have not yet completed our determination of the impact of adopting ASU 2014-09, ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10, or ASU 2016-12 on the financial statements, although, we do not expect the impact, if any, to be significant. We expect to adopt the pronouncement on a full retrospective basis on January 1, 2018.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). This guidance revises existing practice related to accounting for leases under ASC 840, Leases ( ASC 840\u201d) for both lessees and lessors. The new guidance in ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for nearly all leases (other than leases that meet the definition of a short-term lease). The lease liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments and the right-of-use asset will be based on the lease liability, subject to adjustment such as for initial direct costs. For income statement purposes, the new standard retains a dual model similar to ASC 840, requiring leases to be classified as either operating leases or capital leases. For lessees, operating leases will result in straight-line expense (similar to current accounting by lessees for operating leases under ASC 840) while capital leases will result in a front-loaded expense pattern (similar to current accounting by lessees for capital leases under ASC 840). The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of this standard on our financial statements.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The guidance is intended to simplify several areas of accounting for share-based compensation, including income tax impacts, classification on the statement of cash flows and forfeitures. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2017 and its adoption will have no impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Restricted Cash. The guidance is intended to address the diversity that currently exists in the classification and presentation of changes in restricted cash on the statement of cash flows. The new standard requires that entities show the changes in the total of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents on the statement of cash flows and no longer present transfers between cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents on the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of this standard on our financial statements.\nJOBS Act\nThe JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce reporting requirements for an emerging growth company.\u201d As an emerging growth company, we have elected to not take advantage of the extended transition period afforded\nby the JOBS Act for the implementation of new or revised accounting standards and, as a result, will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies.\nInternal Control Over Financial Reporting\nAssessing our staffing and training procedures to improve our internal control over financial reporting is an ongoing process. We are not currently required to comply with all of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. For the year ended December 31, 2016, management is required to make an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as required by Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as further described in Item 9A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act exempts non-accelerated filers from compliance with Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which relates to the independent auditor's attestation on the effectiveness of the issuer's internal control over financial reporting. As such, our independent registered public accounting firm has not been engaged to express, nor have they expressed, an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016.", "item_7_tables": "Table 316: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

situation as of December 31, 2016, and provides an overview of the company's operations, its recent financial history, and projections for the future.\n\n**Overview:**\nThe company specializes in developing treatments for neurological and psychiatric disorders. Despite possessing a promising portfolio of clinical and preclinical compounds, the company faces a significant challenge as it had only $5.1 million in cash and equivalents against $4.3 million in current liabilities as of December 31, 2016. This raises doubts about its ability to continue operations without securing additional financing.\n\n**Financial Status:**\nThe company is not generating sufficient funds to finance its ongoing operations in the long term and needs additional capital to pursue Phase 2/3 trials for CERC-501, and to commence Phase 1 development of CERC-611. It has no ongoing clinical trials due to a lack of capital, except for three third-party funded trials of CERC-501.\n\n**Product Candidate Overview:**\n- CERC-501 is a kappa opioid receptor antagonist under consideration for treating major depressive disorder (MDD).\n- CERC-301 is an NMDA receptor antagonist also aimed at treating MDD.\n- CERC-611 is an AMPA receptor antagonist planned for treating partial-onset seizures in epilepsy.\n- CERC-406 is a COMT inhibitor designed for treating cognitive impairment symptoms in MDD patients.\n\n**Financial Transactions:**\n- The Aspire Capital Transaction involved selling shares for total proceeds of roughly $15 million and had generated $1.9 million as of the report's publication.\n- An Equity Distribution Agreement was made with Maxim Group LLC to potentially sell shares through Maxim, with around $287,000 raised so far.\n- SunTrust Robinson Humphrey was engaged to assist in reviewing strategic alternatives focused on maximizing shareholder value.\n\n**Operating Results:**\nRevenue has only come from research grants, with no commercial product sales. Research and development costs, general and administrative expenses, and non-cash charges like stock-based compensation dominate the expenses.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources:**\nAs of December 31, 2016, financing had come primarily from public offer, private placements, and debt issuance. The company has substantial funding needs for product development and commercialization efforts and does not anticipate generating product revenue unless their product candidates obtain marketing approval and are commercialized.\n\n**Outlook:**\nThe company's ongoing losses and negative cash flows create considerable doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern within a year after the financial statements were issued. The company\u2019s survival hinges on obtaining additional financing to fund operations.\n\n**Accounting Policies and Estimates:**\nManagement bases estimates on historical experience and various other judgments that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The financial summary discusses revenue recognition for grants, research and development costs, income taxes, fair value estimates for warrants, UPOs (Unit Purchase Options), and stock-based compensation.\n\n**Newly Adopted and Recent Accounting Pronouncements:**\nThe company has adopted new standards regarding disclosures on the going concern and plans to adopt additional pronouncements regarding revenue recognition, leases, and share-based payment transactions that may have future impacts on financial statements.\n\n**Internal Control Over Financial Reporting:**\nAlthough exempt from some requirements due to its \"emerging growth company\" status, the company acknowledges the need for assessing staffing and training procedures to improve internal control over financial reporting. Management has made an assessment of these controls for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe company is in a precarious financial position due to its lack of liquidity and ongoing need for substantial funding. Its ability to continue operations is uncertain without additional capital, which it is actively seeking through various means."}
