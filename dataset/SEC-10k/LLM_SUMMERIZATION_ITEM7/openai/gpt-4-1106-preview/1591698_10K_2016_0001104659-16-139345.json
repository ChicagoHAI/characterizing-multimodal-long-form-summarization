Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe statements included herein that are not based solely on historical facts are \u201cforward looking statements.\u201d Such forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by us in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and under Part I, Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nWe are a cloud-based provider of payroll and human capital management or HCM software solutions for medium-sized organizations, which we define as those having between 20 and 1,000 employees. Our comprehensive and easy-to-use solutions enable our clients to manage their workforces more effectively. Our solutions help drive strategic human capital decision-making and improve employee engagement by enhancing the HR, payroll and finance capabilities of our clients.\nEffective management of human capital is a core function in all organizations and requires a significant commitment of resources. Medium-sized organizations operating without the infrastructure, expertise or personnel of larger enterprises are uniquely pressured to manage their human capital effectively.\nOur solutions were specifically designed to meet the payroll and HCM needs of medium-sized organizations. We designed our cloud-based platform to provide a unified suite of applications using a multi-tenant architecture. Our solutions are highly flexible and configurable and feature a modern, intuitive user experience. Our platform offers automated data integration with over 200 related third-party systems, such as 401(k), benefits and insurance provider systems.\nOur Paylocity Web Pay product is our core payroll solution and was the first of our current offerings introduced into the market. We believe payroll is the most critical system of record for medium-sized organizations and an essential gateway to other HCM functionality. We have invested in, and we intend to continue to invest in, research and development to expand our product offerings and advance our platform.\nWe believe there is a significant opportunity to grow our business by increasing our number of clients and we intend to invest in our business to achieve this purpose. We market and sell our solutions primarily through our direct sales force. We have increased our sales and marketing expenses as we have added sales representatives and related sales and marketing personnel. We intend to continue to grow our sales and marketing organization across new and existing geographic territories. In addition to growing our number of clients, we intend to grow our revenue over the long term by increasing the number and quality of products that clients purchase from us. To do so, we must continue to enhance and grow the number of solutions we offer to advance our platform.\nWe believe that delivering a positive service experience is an essential element of our ability to sell our solutions and retain our clients. We seek to develop deep relationships with our clients through our unified service model, which has been designed to meet the service needs of medium-sized organizations. We expect to continue to invest in and grow our implementation and client service organization as our client base grows.\nWe believe we have the opportunity to continue to grow our business over the long term, and to do so we have invested, and intend to continue to invest, across our entire organization. These investments include increasing the number of personnel across all functional areas, along with improving our solutions and infrastructure to support our growth. The timing and amount of these investments vary based on the rate at which we add new clients, add new personnel and scale our application development and other activities. Many of these investments will occur in advance of experiencing any direct benefit from them which will make it difficult to determine if we are effectively allocating our resources. We expect these investments to increase our costs on an absolute basis, but as we grow our number of clients and our related revenues, we anticipate that we will gain economies of scale and increased operating leverage. As a result, we expect our gross and operating margins will improve over the long term.\nAs our business has grown, we have become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in domestic and global economic conditions. If general economic conditions were to deteriorate further, including declines in private sector employment growth and business productivity, increases in the unemployment rate and changes in interest rates, we may experience delays in our sales cycles, increased pressure from prospective customers to offer discounts and increased pressure from existing customers to renew expiring recurring revenue agreements for lower amounts. Our interest income on funds held for clients continues to be adversely impacted by historically low interest rates.\nOur operating subsidiary Paylocity Corporation was incorporated in July 1997 as an Illinois corporation. In November 2013, we formed Paylocity Holding Corporation, a Delaware corporation, of which Paylocity Corporation is now a wholly-owned subsidiary. Paylocity Holding Corporation had no operations prior to the restructuring. All of our business operations have historically been, and are currently, conducted by Paylocity Corporation, and the financial results presented herein are attributable to the results of its operations.\nKey Metrics\nWe regularly review a number of metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions.\nRecurring Revenue Growth\nOur recurring revenue model and high annual revenue retention rates provide significant visibility into our future operating results and cash flow from operations. This visibility enables us to better manage and invest in our business. Recurring revenue, which is comprised of recurring fees and interest income on funds held for clients, increased from $101.9 million in fiscal 2014 to $144.1 million in fiscal 2015, representing a 41% year-over-year increase. Recurring revenue increased from $144.1 million in fiscal 2015 to $220.1 million in fiscal 2016, representing a 53% year-over-year increase. The increase in our recurring revenue growth was positively impacted by the launch in fiscal year 2016 of our Affordable Care Act (\u201cACA\u201d) compliance solution, which had significant penetration beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016. We expect the impact on year-over-year quarterly revenue growth of our ACA compliance solution to be highest in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 given the timing of significant penetration, beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016. Recurring revenue represented 94% of total revenue in both fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015 and 95% of total revenue in fiscal year 2016.\nClient Count Growth\nWe believe there is a significant opportunity to grow our business by increasing our number of clients. We have increased our number of clients from approximately 8,500 as of June 30, 2014 to approximately 12,500 as of June 30, 2016, representing a compound annual growth rate of approximately 21%. The table below sets forth our client count for the periods indicated, rounded to the nearest fifty.\nTable 13: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Client Count\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe rate at which we add clients is highly variable period-to-period and highly seasonal as many clients switch solutions during the first calendar quarter of each year. Although many clients have multiple divisions, segments or locations, we only count such clients once for these purposes.\nAnnual Revenue Retention Rate\nOur annual revenue retention rate has been in excess of 92% during each of the past three fiscal years. We calculate our annual revenue retention rate as our total revenue for the preceding 12 months, less the annualized value of revenue lost during the preceding 12 months, divided by our total revenue for the preceding 12 months. We calculate the annualized value of revenue lost by summing the recurring fees paid by lost clients over the previous twelve months prior to their termination if they have been a client for a minimum of twelve months. For those lost clients who became clients within the last twelve months, we sum the recurring fees for the period that they have been a client and then annualize the amount. We exclude interest income on funds held for clients from the revenue retention calculation. We believe that our annual revenue retention rate is an important metric to measure overall client satisfaction and the general quality of our product and service offerings.\nRecurring Fees From New Clients\nWe calculate recurring fees from new clients as the percentage of year-to-date recurring fees from all clients on our solutions which had not been on or used any of our solutions for a full year as of the start of the current fiscal year. We believe recurring fees from new clients is an important metric to measure the expansion of our existing client base as well as the growth in our client base. Our recurring fees from new clients was 44% for fiscal 2014 and 45% for both fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016.\nAdjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Recurring Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA\nWe disclose Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Recurring Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA because we use them to evaluate our performance, and we believe Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Recurring Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA assist in the comparison of our performance across reporting periods by excluding certain items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. We believe these metrics are used in the financial community, and we present it to enhance investors' understanding of our operating performance and cash flows.\nAdjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Recurring Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP, and you should not consider Adjusted Gross Profit as an alternative to gross profit, Adjusted Recurring Gross Profit as an alternative to total recurring revenues, or Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative to net income (loss) or cash provided by (used in) operating activities, in each case as determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our definition of Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Recurring Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA may be different than the definition utilized for similarly-titled measures used by other companies.\nWe define Adjusted Gross Profit as gross profit before amortization of capitalized internal-use software costs, stock-based compensation expense and employer payroll taxes related to stock releases and option exercises and one-time founder funded bonus pay-outs, if any. We define Adjusted Recurring Gross Profit as total recurring revenues after cost of recurring revenues and before amortization of capitalized internal-use software costs, stock-based compensation expense and employer payroll taxes related to stock releases and option exercises and one-time founder funded bonus pay-outs, if any. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense and employer payroll taxes related to stock releases and option exercises and one-time founder funded bonus pay-outs, if any. The table below sets forth our Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Recurring Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented.\nTable 14: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted Gross Profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $57,029\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $87,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $141,029\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted Recurring Gross Profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $67,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $101,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $161,184\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $5,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $8,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $28,398\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor a further discussion of Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Recurring Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA, including a reconciliation of Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Recurring Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP, see Part II, Item 6: \u201cConsolidated Selected Financial Data.\u201d\nBasis of Presentation\nRevenues\nRecurring Fees\nWe derive the majority of our revenues from recurring fees attributable to our cloud-based payroll and HCM software solutions. Recurring fees for each client generally include a base fee in addition to a fee based on the number of client employees and the number of products a client uses. We also charge fees attributable to our preparation of W-2 documents and annual required filings on behalf of our clients. Over the past three years, our client size has been on average over 100 employees. We derive revenue from a client based on the solutions purchased by the client, the number of client employees as well as the amount, type and timing of services provided in respect of those client employees. As such, the number of client employees on our system is not a good indicator of our financial results in any period. Recurring fees attributable to our cloud-based payroll and HCM solutions accounted for approximately 92%, 93% and 94% of our total revenues during the years ended June 30, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.\nOur agreements with clients do not have a specified term and are generally cancellable by the client on 60 days' or less notice. Our agreements do not include general rights of return and do not provide clients with the right to take possession of the software supporting the services being provided. We recognize recurring fees in the period in which services are provided and when collection of fees is reasonably assured and the amount of fees is fixed or determinable.\nInterest Income on Funds Held for Clients\nWe earn interest income on funds held for clients. We collect funds for employee payroll payments and related taxes in advance of remittance to employees and taxing authorities. Prior to remittance to employees and taxing authorities, we earn interest on these funds through financial institutions with which we have automated clearing house, or ACH, arrangements.\nImplementation Services and Other\nImplementation services and other revenues primarily consist of implementation fees charged to new clients for professional services provided to implement and configure our payroll and HCM solutions. Implementations of our payroll solutions typically require only three to four weeks at which point the new client's payroll is first run using our solution, our implementation services are deemed completed, and we recognize the related revenue. We implement additional HCM products as requested by clients and leverage the data within our payroll solution to accelerate our implementation processes. Implementation services and other revenues may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter based on the number of new clients, pricing and the product utilization.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of Recurring Revenues\nCosts of recurring revenues are generally expensed as incurred, and include costs to provide our payroll and other HCM solutions primarily consisting of employee-related expenses, including wages, stock-based compensation, bonuses and benefits, relating to the provision of ongoing client support, payroll tax filing and distribution of printed checks and other materials. These costs also include third-party reseller costs, delivery costs, computing costs and amortization of capitalized internal-use software costs, as well as bank fees associated with client fund transfers. We expect to realize cost efficiencies over the long term as our business scales, resulting in improved operating leverage and increased margins.\nWe capitalize a portion of our internal-use software costs, which are then all amortized as a cost of recurring revenues. We amortized $2.2 million, $2.6 million and $5.4 million of capitalized internal-use software costs in fiscal 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.\nCost of Implementation Services and Other\nCost of implementation services and other consists primarily of employee-related expenses, including wages, stock-based compensation, bonuses and benefits involved in the implementation of our payroll and other HCM solutions for new clients. Implementation costs are generally fixed in the short-term and exceed associated implementation revenue charged to each client. We intend to grow our business through acquisition of new clients, and doing so will require increased personnel to implement our solutions. Therefore our cost of implementation services and other is expected to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future.\nOperating Expenses\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses for our direct sales and marketing staff, including wages, commissions, stock-based compensation, bonuses and benefits, marketing expenses and other related costs. Commissions are primarily earned and recognized in the month when implementation is complete and the client first utilizes a service, typically by running its first payroll. Bonuses paid to sales staff for attainment of certain performance criteria are accrued in the fiscal year in which they are earned and are subsequently paid annually in the first fiscal quarter of the following year.\nWe will seek to grow our number of clients for the foreseeable future and therefore our sales and marketing expense is expected to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we grow our sales organization and expand our marketing activities.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses for our research and development and product management staff, including wages, stock-based compensation, bonuses and benefits. Additional expenses include costs related to the development, maintenance, quality assurance and testing of new technologies and ongoing refinement of our existing solutions. Research and development expenses, other than internal-use software costs qualifying for capitalization, are expensed as incurred.\nWe capitalize a portion of our development costs related to internal-use software. The timing of our capitalized development projects may affect the amount of development costs expensed in any given period. The table below sets forth the amounts of capitalized and expensed research and development expenses for each of fiscal 2014, 2015 and 2016.\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capitalized portion of research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $4,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $4,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $9,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expensed portion of research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,355\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26,736\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $15,029\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $24,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $36,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expect to grow our research and development efforts as we continue to broaden our product offerings and extend our technological leadership by investing in the development of new technologies and introducing them to new and existing clients. We expect research and development expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars but to vary as a percentage of total revenue on a period-to-period basis.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of other employee-related costs, including wages, stock-based compensation, bonuses and benefits for our administrative, finance, accounting, and human resources departments. Additional expenses include consulting and professional fees, occupancy costs, insurance and other corporate expenses.\nWe expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars as a result of our operation as a public company. These expenses include costs associated with regulations governing public companies, costs of directors' and officers' liability insurance and professional services expenses.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther income (expense) generally consists of interest income related to interest received on our cash and cash equivalents and disposals of property and equipment.\nResults of

We consider the policies discussed below as critical to understanding our financial statements, as their application places the most significant demands on management's judgment. Management bases its estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience, current economic and industry conditions and on various other factors deemed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Because the use of estimates is an integral part of the financial reporting process, actual results could differ and such differences could be material.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive revenues predominantly from recurring revenues associated with our cloud-based payroll and HCM software applications and one-time service fees for implementation of our solutions. Our agreements with clients do not include general rights of return and do not provide clients with the right to take possession of the software supporting the services being provided. As such, revenue is recognized as services are performed.\nWe recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are achieved:\n\u00b7 There is persuasive evidence of an agreement;\n\u00b7 The service has been provided to the client;\n\u00b7 The amount of fees to be paid by the client is fixed or determinable; and\n\u00b7 Collection of the fees is reasonably assured.\nFor arrangements with multiple-elements, we recognize revenues in accordance with Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2009-13, Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements. For each agreement, we evaluate whether the individual deliverables qualify as separate units of accounting. If one or more of the deliverables does not have standalone value upon delivery, the deliverables that do not have standalone value are generally combined and treated as a single unit of accounting. Revenue for arrangements treated as a single unit of accounting is generally recognized within the same month that the services are rendered given that the agreements are cancellable with 60 days' or less notice.\nIn determining whether revenues from implementation services can be accounted for separately from recurring revenues, we consider the nature of the implementation services and the availability of the implementation services from other vendors. We established standalone value for implementation primarily due to the number of partners that perform these services and account for such implementation services separate from the recurring revenues.\nIf we determine that the services have standalone value upon delivery, we account for each separately and revenues are recognized as the services are delivered with allocation of consideration based on the relative selling price method. That method requires the selling price of each element in a multiple deliverable arrangement to be based on, in descending order: (i) vendor- specific objective evidence of fair value, or VSOE, (ii) third-party evidence of fair value, or TPE, or (iii) management's best estimate of the selling price, or BESP.\nWe are not able to demonstrate VSOE of selling price with respect to our recurring fees paid for our solutions because the deliverables are sold across an insufficiently narrow range of prices on a stand-alone basis. We are also not able to demonstrate TPE for subscription fees because no third-party offerings are reasonably comparable to our product offerings. We thus establish BESP by service offering, requiring the use of significant estimates and judgment. To determine BESP, we consider numerous factors, including the nature of the deliverables themselves, the geography for the sale, internal costs, and pricing and discounting practices utilized by our direct sales force. Arrangement consideration is allocated to each deliverable based on the established BESP and subject to the limitation that because the arrangements are cancellable with 60 days' or less notice, recurring revenue is not allocated to any deliverable until the consideration has been earned, typically with each payroll cycle or monthly, depending on the service.\nProperty and Equipment and Long-Lived Assets\nWe state property and equipment at cost. We calculate depreciation on property and equipment using a straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to seven years for most classes of assets, or over the term of the related lease for leasehold improvements. We recognized depreciation expense of $4.1 million, $5.1 million and $6.9 million during the years ended June 30, 2014, 2015, and 2016, respectively.\nWe review long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group be tested for possible impairment, we first compare the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, we recognize impairment to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. We determine fair value through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary.\nCapitalized Internal-Use Software Costs\nWe apply ASC 350-40, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software, to the accounting for costs of internal-use software. Software development costs are capitalized when application development begins, it is probable that the project will be completed, and the software will be used as intended. Costs associated with preliminary project stage activities, training, maintenance and all other post implementation stage activities are expensed as incurred. We also capitalize certain costs related to specific upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in significant additional functionality. The capitalization policy provides for the capitalization of certain payroll costs for employees who are directly associated with developing internal-use software as well as certain external direct costs. Capitalized employee costs are limited to the time directly spent on such projects.\nInternal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over 18 to 24 months. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and test for impairments whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. There were no impairments to capitalized internal-use software during the years ended June 30, 2014, 2015 or 2016. We capitalized $4.7 million, $4.9 million, and $9.5 million of internal-use software costs for the years ended June 30, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively, including stock-based compensation costs of $0.3 million, $0.7 million and $1.1 million in the years ended June 30, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. We amortized $2.2 million, $2.6 million, and $5.4 million of capitalized internal-use software costs for the years ended June 30, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. In fiscal 2014, fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016, we developed significant additional functionality in several of our applications. This development resulted in an increase in capitalized internal-use software costs in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 and in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill is an asset representing the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized. We have recorded goodwill in connection with the acquisitions of BFKMS, Inc. and Synergy Payroll LLC. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is tested for impairment at least annually. ASU 2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment provides an entity the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount prior to performing the two-step impairment test. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, is less than its carrying amount, the two-step goodwill impairment test is required. Otherwise no further analysis is required.\nIf the two-step goodwill impairment test is required, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit. In the second step, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation and the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill. Fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. In the event the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, step two is not performed.\nWe perform our annual impairment review of goodwill in our fiscal fourth quarter or when a triggering event occurs between annual impairment tests. We did not recognize any impairment for fiscal year 2015 or 2016 as a result of our impairment tests. Given that we did not have recorded goodwill until our fiscal fourth quarter of 2014, no impairment tests were required to be completed in fiscal 2014.\nIntangible assets are comprised primarily of client list acquisitions and are reported net of accumulated amortization on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Client relationships use the straight-line method of amortization over an accelerated nine year time frame, while the non-solicitation agreements uses the straight-line method of amortization over two to three year life of the agreements. Amortization expense associated with our intangible assets was $0.1 million, $0.9 million and $1.5 million during the years ended June 30, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. We test intangible assets for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. There were no such events or changes in circumstances during the years ended June 30, 2014, 2015 and 2016.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for federal income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nDeferred tax assets may be reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we determine it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns and future profitability. Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents the best estimate of those future events. Changes in current estimates, due to unanticipated events or otherwise, could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets. The weight given to positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified. As such, it is generally difficult for positive evidence regarding projected future taxable income exclusive of reversing taxable temporary differences to outweigh objective negative evidence of recent financial reporting losses. Cumulative losses in recent years are significant negative evidence that is difficult to overcome in determining that a valuation allowance is not needed against deferred tax assets.\nWe recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (Topic 740) (\u201cASU 2015-17\u201d), which requires all deferred income tax assets and liabilities to be classified as non-current in a classified balance sheet. As allowed by ASU 2015-17, we adopted the new requirements as of June 30, 2016, on a prospective basis. The adoption of this standard resulted in a reclassification of deferred tax assets and liabilities to the non-current deferred tax liability in our consolidated balance\nsheet as of June 30, 2016. ASU 2015-17 did not have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet and had no impact on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows. No prior periods were retrospectively adjusted.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe maintain a 2008 Equity Incentive Plan (the \u201c2008 Plan\u201d) and a 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (the \u201c2014 Plan\u201d) pursuant to which we have issued options to purchase shares of our common stock and grants of restricted stock awards to employees, officers, directors and consultants. The 2014 Plan serves as the successor to the 2008 Plan and permits the granting of options to purchase common stock and other equity incentives at the discretion of the compensation committee of our board of directors. We will not grant any additional awards under our 2008 Plan, though our 2008 Plan will continue to govern the terms and conditions of all outstanding equity awards granted under the 2008 Plan.\nAs of June 30, 2016, options to purchase 3.5 million shares of our common stock were outstanding, 1.0 million restricted stock units were outstanding and 6.2 million shares of our common stock were reserved for future grant.\nThe following table presents data related to stock options granted on the dates indicated:\nTable 25: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> July 8,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Aug. 26,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Mar. 18,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Aug. 18,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Aug. 17,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Options granted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 466,663\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,065,541\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 321,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 149,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fair value of stock\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $7.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $7.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $17.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $24.80\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $35.28\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Exercise price\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $7.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $7.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $17.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $24.80\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $35.28\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fair value of option\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $1.71\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $1.71\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $7.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $11.14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $12.92\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEquity-classified awards are measured at the grant date fair value of the award and expense is recognized, net of assumed forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award. We estimate grant date fair value using the Black-Scholes Option-Pricing Model, or Black-Scholes, which requires the use of certain subjective assumptions. Below is a table of the key weighted-average assumptions used in the option valuation calculation for options issued on the dates indicated.\nTable 26: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> July 8,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Aug. 26,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Mar. 18,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Aug. 18,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Aug. 17,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Valuation assumptions:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average expected dividend yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average expected volatility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43.9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average expected term (years)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.52%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.52%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.94%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.91%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.83%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe use a dividend yield assumption of zero as we have not paid regular cash dividends on our common stock and presently have no intention of paying any such cash dividends. Since our shares were not publicly traded prior to March 2014, expected volatility is estimated based on the average historical volatility of similar entities with publicly traded shares. We calculate the expected term using company specific historical data, such as employee option exercise and employee post-vesting departure behavior. The risk-free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve at the date of grant.\nStock-based compensation expense was $4.9 million, $13.2 million and $17.6 million for the years ended June 30, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. If factors change and we employ different assumptions, stock-based compensation expense may differ from what we have recorded in the past. If there is a difference between the assumptions used in determining stock-based compensation expense and the actual factors which become known over time, we may change the input factors used in determining stock-based compensation costs for future grants. These changes, if any, may adversely impact our results of operations in the period such changes are made. We expect to continue to grant stock options in the future, and to the extent that we do, our actual stock-based compensation expense recognized in future periods will likely increase.\nOne significant factor in determining the fair value of our options granted through August 2013, when using Black-Scholes, is the fair value of the common stock underlying those stock options. Prior to March 2014, we were a private company with no active public market for our common stock. Therefore, the fair value of the common stock underlying our stock options was determined by our board of directors, which considered in making its determination of fair value a variety of factors including contemporaneous periodic valuation studies from an independent and unrelated third-party valuation firm. Now that we have a public market for our stock, we observe the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant in accordance with the terms of the award.\nBased on the closing stock price on June 30, 2016 of $43.20, the aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding options to purchase shares of our common stock as of June 30, 2016 was $108.9 million, of which $73.5 million related to vested options and $35.4 million to unvested options. The aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding restricted stock units as of June 30, 2016 was $43.3 million, of which all were unvested.\nThird-Party Valuation Methodology\nIn performing its analysis of equity awards issued prior to the initial public offering, the valuation firm engaged in discussions with management, analyzed historical and forecasted financial statements, and reviewed our corporate documents. The valuation consultant utilized the guidelines outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. The valuation study was prepared using a combination of four generally accepted approaches to determining the fair market value of a business: the discounted cash flows, or DCF, method, the guideline public company method, the prior transaction method and the market transactions method. The discounted cash flows method forecasted future cash flows utilizing a terminal value based on our expectation of long-term growth to arrive at a valuation. The guideline public company method utilizes a market approach which estimates the fair value of a company by applying to that company the market multiples of publicly-traded companies to arrive at a valuation. The prior transaction method looks to recent arms-length transactions in a company's capital stock to arrive at a valuation. The market transactions method utilizes a market approach which estimates the fair value of a company by applying to that company the market multiples of publicly-traded and private companies to arrive at a valuation.\nFiscal 2014\nThe independent third-party valuation as of May 31, 2013 was performed using the DCF method, the guideline public company method and the market transactions method. The valuation firm considered our nature and history, the condition and outlook of the industry in which we operate, the book value of our stock and our financial condition, the earning capacity of our business, the dividend-paying capacity of our business, prior transactions involving our stock, the market price of public traded stock of companies engage in the same or a similar line of business and our goodwill and intangible value. The valuation firm took into account our financial statements for fiscal 2009 through 2012, as well as interim financial statements for the eleven months ended May 31, 2013 and May 31, 2012.\nIn applying the guideline public company method, the valuation firm analyzed the prices that investors are willing to pay for the publicly-traded common stock of companies that are comparable to us. The valuation firm then calculated total market value of invested capital multiples based on TTM earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and TTM revenues. The valuation firm considered our smaller size, limited access to capital, historical and future growth expectations, and differences in liquidity, profitability and leverage among the guideline companies before selecting a TTM multiple that was slightly above the average of the TTM revenues multiples for the companies determined to be most comparable to us.\nIn applying the DCF method, the valuation firm analyzed financial projections prepared by our management for a five year period. The valuation firm calculated our net cash flows to invested capital by taking our debt-free net income, as estimated by management, adding depreciation expenses and subtracting both capital expenditures, as estimated by management, and incremental working capital needs, which were estimated based on a review of an industry average. For the terminal year, the valuation firm applied a revenue multiple, calculated using the guideline public company method. A discount rate of 35% was then applied. To determine the discount rate, the valuation firm reviewed published investment hurdle rates typically required by institutional investors for companies of comparable size and risk. The 35% discount rate was equal to the discount rate applied in the DCF analysis conducted as of June 30, 2012.\nIn applying the market transactions method, the valuation firm reviewed publicly available data regarding transactions that have occurred in the industry, as well as prior arms-length transactions in our capital stock. The valuation firm applied a revenue multiple that was slightly above the median revenue multiple of all transactions and in-line with the sale of our Series B preferred stock in June 2012.\nOur value was then allocated among our shares of Series A preferred stock, our shares of Series B preferred stock and our shares of common stock using the option pricing equity allocation method, using Black-Scholes. In utilizing the Black-Scholes method, our volatility was estimated at 31% which was based on the average volatility of the guideline public companies over a five-year period. The assumed time to expiration was four years, which was based on the estimated timing of a potential liquidity event. Finally, the valuation firm applied a marketability discount to reflect the lack of an active market in shares of our common stock, which resulted in a fair market value of $6.90 per share.\nOur board of directors considered this third-party valuation and the other factors discussed above in determining that the fair market value of our common stock was $7.04 on July 8, 2013 and August 26, 2013.\nReverse Stock Split\nOn March 5, 2014, we effected a three-for-two reverse stock split on our Common Stock.\nInitial Public Offering\nIn March 2014, we completed our initial public offering or IPO in which we issued and sold 5.4 million shares of common stock and existing shareholders sold 2.7 million shares of common stock at a public offering price of $17.00 per share. We did not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the existing shareholders. We received net proceeds of $81.9 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $6.4 million and other offering expenses of $2.9 million.\nFollow-On Offering\nIn December 2014, the Company completed a follow-on offering in which it issued and sold 0.8 million shares of common stock and existing shareholders sold 3.9 million shares of common stock at a public offering price of $26.25 per share. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the existing shareholders. The Company received net proceeds of $18.4 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $0.9 million and other offering expenses of $0.4 million.\nIn January 2015, the underwriters for the Company's follow-on offering exercised their option to purchase 0.4 million additional shares from certain shareholders of the Company of the 0.7 million available as described in the final prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) in December 2014. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the existing shareholders.\nSecondary Offering\nIn September 2015, the Company completed a secondary offering in which its existing shareholders sold 3.7 million shares of common stock at a public offering price of $29.75 per share. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the existing shareholders.\nIn October 2015, the underwriters for the Company's secondary offering exercised their option to purchase 0.6 million additional shares from certain shareholders of the Company as described in the final prospectus filed with the SEC on September 25, 2015. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the existing shareholders.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary liquidity needs are related to the funding of general business requirements, including working capital requirements, research and development, and capital expenditures. As of June 30, 2016, our principal source of liquidity was $86.5 million of cash and cash equivalents.\nIn order to grow our business, we intend to increase our personnel and related expenses and to make significant investments in our platform, data centers and infrastructure generally. The timing and amount of these investments will vary based on the rate at which we can add new clients and new personnel and the scale of our application development, data center and other activities. Many of these investments will occur in advance of our experiencing any direct benefit from them which could negatively impact our liquidity and cash flows during any particular period and may make it difficult to determine if we are effectively allocating our resources. However, we expect to fund our operations, capital expenditures and other investments principally with cash flows from operations, and to the extent that our liquidity needs exceed our cash from operations, we would look to our cash on hand and borrowing capacity to satisfy those needs.\nOur cash flows from our investing and financing activities are influenced by the amount of funds held for clients which varies significantly from quarter to quarter. The balance of the funds we hold depends on our clients' payroll calendar, and therefore such balance changes from period to period in accordance with the timing with each payroll cycle. Funds held for clients are restricted solely for the repayment of client fund obligations.\nWe believe our current cash and cash equivalents and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and other investment requirements for at least the next 12 months.\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth data regarding cash flows for the periods indicated:\nTable 27: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $7,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $11,105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $32,993\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flows from investing activities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capitalized internal-use software costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,349)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,215)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,391)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchases of property and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,667)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,020)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16,083)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Payments for acquisitions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,450)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11,979)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (483)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net change in funds held for clients\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (61,356)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (173,958)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (648,403)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (78,822)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (199,172)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (673,360)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flows from financing activities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net change in client funds obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 61,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 173,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 648,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Principal payments on long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,563)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Proceeds from initial public offering, net of issuance costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 82,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Proceeds from follow-on offering, net of issuance costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Payments on initial public offering costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (75)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital contribution\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Proceeds from exercise of stock options\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Proceeds from employee stock purchase plan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,773\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,793)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,926)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 142,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 190,477\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 645,605\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $71,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $2,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $5,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $7.2 million, $11.1 million and $33.0 million for the years ended June 30, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.\nThe increase in net cash provided by operating activities from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016 as well as from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to improved operating results after adjusting for non-cash items including stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $78.8 million, $199.2 million and $673.4 million, for the years ended June 30, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.\nChanges in net cash provided by (used in) investing activities are significantly influenced by the amount of funds held for clients at the end of a reporting period. Changes in the amount of funds held for client from period to period will vary substantially. Our payroll processing activities involves the movement of significant funds from the account of an employer to employees and relevant taxing authorities. During the year ended June 30, 2016 we processed over $74 billion in payroll transactions. Though we debit a client's account prior to any disbursement on its behalf, there is a delay between our payment of amounts due to employees and taxing and other regulatory authorities and when the incoming funds from the client to cover these amounts payable actually clear into our operating accounts. We currently have agreements with nine banks to execute ACH and wire transfers to support our client payroll and tax services. We believe we have sufficient capacity under these ACH arrangements to handle our transactions for the foreseeable future.\nExcluding the net change in funds held for clients, our net cash used in investing activities was $17.5 million, $25.2 million and $25.0 million, for the years ended June 30, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.\nThe increase in net cash used in investing activities of $474.2 million from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the timing of receipts and disbursements of cash and cash equivalents held to satisfy client funds obligations of $474.4 million, increased purchases of property and equipment by $7.1 million and increased capitalized internal-use software costs of $4.2 million, partially offset by a $11.5 million reduction in payments for acquisitions. The increase in net cash used in investing activities of $120.4 million from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the timing of receipts and disbursements of cash and cash equivalents held to\nsatisfy client funds obligations of $112.6 million, increased payments of $5.5 million to acquire certain assets of two of our resellers and increased purchases of property and equipment by $2.3 million.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $142.9 million, $190.5 million and $645.6 million for the years ended June 30, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.\nThe increase in net cash provided by financing activities of $455.1 million from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016 was primarily the result of a $474.4 million increase in funds held for clients, a $1.2 million increase in proceeds received as a result of employees' purchase of shares under the employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by $18.4 million of proceeds related to the follow-on offering, net of issuance costs during fiscal 2015 and a $2.1 million increase in taxes paid related to employees' net share settlement of equity awards. The increase in net cash provided by financing activities from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2015 was primarily the result of a $112.6 million increase in funds held for clients, $1.8 million in proceeds received as a result of employees' purchase of shares under the employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by $3.8 million in taxes paid related to employees' net share settlement of equity awards and $63.7 million year-over-year decrease in proceeds received as a result of public offerings, net of offering costs.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nOur principal commitments consist of operating lease obligations. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at June 30, 2016:\nTable 28: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payment Due By Fiscal Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2018-2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2020-2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2022 and\nThereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $111,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $5,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $14,035\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $15,949\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $75,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unconditional purchase obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,848\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $114,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $7,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $14,881\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $15,949\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $75,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital Expenditures\nWe expect to increase capital spending as we continue to grow our business and expand and enhance our data centers and technical infrastructure. Future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of sales growth. In the event that our sales growth or other factors do not meet our expectations, we may eliminate or curtail capital projects in order to mitigate the impact on our use of cash. Capital expenditures were $6.7 million, $9.0 million and $16.1 million for the years ended June 30, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively, exclusive of capitalized internal-use software costs of $4.3 million, $4.2 million, and $8.4 million for the same periods, respectively.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that may be material to investors.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (\u201cASU 2014-09\u201d). ASU 2014-09 supersedes a majority of existing revenue recognition guidance under US GAAP, and requires a company to recognize revenue when it transfers goods or services to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled. Companies may need to apply more judgment and estimation techniques or methods while recognizing revenue, which could result in additional disclosures to the financial statements. In addition, in March 2016, April 2016 and May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) (\u201cASU 2016-08\u201d), ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing (\u201cASU 2016-10\u201d) and ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients (\u201cASU 2016-12\u201d), respectively, to amend certain guidance in ASU 2014-09. Topic 606 allows for either a retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. ASU 2014-09 was originally effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. In July 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of ASU 2014-09 and all amendments to it, with a new effective date for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted as of the original effective date. The Company is currently assessing the potential effects of these changes to its consolidated financial statements and is evaluating the adoption method and timing.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (Topic 740) (\u201cASU 2015-17\u201d), which requires all deferred income tax assets and liabilities to be classified as non-current in a classified balance sheet. As allowed by ASU 2015-17, we adopted the new requirements as of June 30, 2016, on a prospective basis. The adoption of this standard resulted in a reclassification of deferred tax assets and liabilities to the non-current deferred tax liability in our consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2016. ASU 2015-17 did not have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet and had no impact on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows. No prior periods were retrospectively adjusted.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (\u201cASU 2016-02\u201d) which amends various aspects of existing guidance for leases. ASU 2016-02 requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities arising from a lease with terms greater than twelve months, along with additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures. ASU 2016-02 also requires the use of the modified retrospective method, which will require adjustment to all comparative periods presented. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the potential effects of these changes to its consolidated financial statements and is evaluating the timing of adoption.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718) (\u201cASU 2016-09\u201d) which modifies accounting for excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies, forfeitures, and employer tax withholding requirements. ASU 2016-09 also clarifies certain classifications on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the potential effects of these changes to its consolidated financial statements and is evaluating the timing of adoption.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (ASU 2016-13), which requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted as of fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently assessing the potential effects of these changes to its consolidated financial statements and is evaluating the timing of adoption.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe statements included herein that are not based solely on historical facts are \u201cforward looking statements.\u201d Such forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by us in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and under Part I, Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nWe are a cloud-based provider of payroll and human capital management or HCM software solutions for medium-sized organizations, which we define as those having between 20 and 1,000 employees. Our comprehensive and easy-to-use solutions enable our clients to manage their workforces more effectively. Our solutions help drive strategic human capital decision-making and improve employee engagement by enhancing the HR, payroll and finance capabilities of our clients.\nEffective management of human capital is a core function in all organizations and requires a significant commitment of resources. Medium-sized organizations operating without the infrastructure, expertise or personnel of larger enterprises are uniquely pressured to manage their human capital effectively.\nOur solutions were specifically designed to meet the payroll and HCM needs of medium-sized organizations. We designed our cloud-based platform to provide a unified suite of applications using a multi-tenant architecture. Our solutions are highly flexible and configurable and feature a modern, intuitive user experience. Our platform offers automated data integration with over 200 related third-party systems, such as 401(k), benefits and insurance provider systems.\nOur Paylocity Web Pay product is our core payroll solution and was the first of our current offerings introduced into the market. We believe payroll is the most critical system of record for medium-sized organizations and an essential gateway to other HCM functionality. We have invested in, and we intend to continue to invest in, research and development to expand our product offerings and advance our platform.\nWe believe there is a significant opportunity to grow our business by increasing our number of clients and we intend to invest in our business to achieve this purpose. We market and sell our solutions primarily through our direct sales force. We have increased our sales and marketing expenses as we have added sales representatives and related sales and marketing personnel. We intend to continue to grow our sales and marketing organization across new and existing geographic territories. In addition to growing our number of clients, we intend to grow our revenue over the long term by increasing the number and quality of products that clients purchase from us. To do so, we must continue to enhance and grow the number of solutions we offer to advance our platform.\nWe believe that delivering a positive service experience is an essential element of our ability to sell our solutions and retain our clients. We seek to develop deep relationships with our clients through our unified service model, which has been designed to meet the service needs of medium-sized organizations. We expect to continue to invest in and grow our implementation and client service organization as our client base grows.\nWe believe we have the opportunity to continue to grow our business over the long term, and to do so we have invested, and intend to continue to invest, across our entire organization. These investments include increasing the number of personnel across all functional areas, along with improving our solutions and infrastructure to support our growth. The timing and amount of these investments vary based on the rate at which we add new clients, add new personnel and scale our application development and other activities. Many of these investments will occur in advance of experiencing any direct benefit from them which will make it difficult to determine if we are effectively allocating our resources. We expect these investments to increase our costs on an absolute basis, but as we grow our number of clients and our related revenues, we anticipate that we will gain economies of scale and increased operating leverage. As a result, we expect our gross and operating margins will improve over the long term.\nAs our business has grown, we have become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in domestic and global economic conditions. If general economic conditions were to deteriorate further, including declines in private sector employment growth and business productivity, increases in the unemployment rate and changes in interest rates, we may experience delays in our sales cycles, increased pressure from prospective customers to offer discounts and increased pressure from existing customers to renew expiring recurring revenue agreements for lower amounts. Our interest income on funds held for clients continues to be adversely impacted by historically low interest rates.\nOur operating subsidiary Paylocity Corporation was incorporated in July 1997 as an Illinois corporation. In November 2013, we formed Paylocity Holding Corporation, a Delaware corporation, of which Paylocity Corporation is now a wholly-owned subsidiary. Paylocity Holding Corporation had no operations prior to the restructuring. All of our business operations have historically been, and are currently, conducted by Paylocity Corporation, and the financial results presented herein are attributable to the results of its operations.\nKey Metrics\nWe regularly review a number of metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions.\nRecurring Revenue Growth\nOur recurring revenue model and high annual revenue retention rates provide significant visibility into our future operating results and cash flow from operations. This visibility enables us to better manage and invest in our business. Recurring revenue, which is comprised of recurring fees and interest income on funds held for clients, increased from $101.9 million in fiscal 2014 to $144.1 million in fiscal 2015, representing a 41% year-over-year increase. Recurring revenue increased from $144.1 million in fiscal 2015 to $220.1 million in fiscal 2016, representing a 53% year-over-year increase. The increase in our recurring revenue growth was positively impacted by the launch in fiscal year 2016 of our Affordable Care Act (\u201cACA\u201d) compliance solution, which had significant penetration beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016. We expect the impact on year-over-year quarterly revenue growth of our ACA compliance solution to be highest in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 given the timing of significant penetration, beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016. Recurring revenue represented 94% of total revenue in both fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015 and 95% of total revenue in fiscal year 2016.\nClient Count Growth\nWe believe there is a significant opportunity to grow our business by increasing our number of clients. We have increased our number of clients from approximately 8,500 as of June 30, 2014 to approximately 12,500 as of June 30, 2016, representing a compound annual growth rate of approximately 21%. The table below sets forth our client count for the periods indicated, rounded to the nearest fifty.\nTable 13: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Client Count\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe rate at which we add clients is highly variable period-to-period and highly seasonal as many clients switch solutions during the first calendar quarter of each year. Although many clients have multiple divisions, segments or locations, we only count such clients once for these purposes.\nAnnual Revenue Retention Rate\nOur annual revenue retention rate has been in excess of 92% during each of the past three fiscal years. We calculate our annual revenue retention rate as our total revenue for the preceding 12 months, less the annualized value of revenue lost during the preceding 12 months, divided by our total revenue for the preceding 12 months. We calculate the annualized value of revenue lost by summing the recurring fees paid by lost clients over the previous twelve months prior to their termination if they have been a client for a minimum of twelve months. For those lost clients who became clients within the last twelve months, we sum the recurring fees for the period that they have been a client and then annualize the amount. We exclude interest income on funds held for clients from the revenue retention calculation. We believe that our annual revenue retention rate is an important metric to measure overall client satisfaction and the general quality of our product and service offerings.\nRecurring Fees From New Clients\nWe calculate recurring fees from new clients as the percentage of year-to-date recurring fees from all clients on our solutions which had not been on or used any of our solutions for a full year as of the start of the current fiscal year. We believe recurring fees from new clients is an important metric to measure the expansion of our existing client base as well as the growth in our client base. Our recurring fees from new clients was 44% for fiscal 2014 and 45% for both fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016.\nAdjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Recurring Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA\nWe disclose Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Recurring Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA because we use them to evaluate our performance, and we believe Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Recurring Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA assist in the comparison of our performance across reporting periods by excluding certain items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. We believe these metrics are used in the financial community, and we present it to enhance investors' understanding of our operating performance and cash flows.\nAdjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Recurring Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP, and you should not consider Adjusted Gross Profit as an alternative to gross profit, Adjusted Recurring Gross Profit as an alternative to total recurring revenues, or Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative to net income (loss) or cash provided by (used in) operating activities, in each case as determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our definition of Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Recurring Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA may be different than the definition utilized for similarly-titled measures used by other companies.\nWe define Adjusted Gross Profit as gross profit before amortization of capitalized internal-use software costs, stock-based compensation expense and employer payroll taxes related to stock releases and option exercises and one-time founder funded bonus pay-outs, if any. We define Adjusted Recurring Gross Profit as total recurring revenues after cost of recurring revenues and before amortization of capitalized internal-use software costs, stock-based compensation expense and employer payroll taxes related to stock releases and option exercises and one-time founder funded bonus pay-outs, if any. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense and employer payroll taxes related to stock releases and option exercises and one-time founder funded bonus pay-outs, if any. The table below sets forth our Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Recurring Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented.\nTable 14: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted Gross Profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $57,029\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $87,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $141,029\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted Recurring Gross Profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $67,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $101,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $161,184\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $5,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $8,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $28,398\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor a further discussion of Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Recurring Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA, including a reconciliation of Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Recurring Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP, see Part II, Item 6: \u201cConsolidated Selected Financial Data.\u201d\nBasis of Presentation\nRevenues\nRecurring Fees\nWe derive the majority of our revenues from recurring fees attributable to our cloud-based payroll and HCM software solutions. Recurring fees for each client generally include a base fee in addition to a fee based on the number of client employees and the number of products a client uses. We also charge fees attributable to our preparation of W-2 documents and annual required filings on behalf of our clients. Over the past three years, our client size has been on average over 100 employees. We derive revenue from a client based on the solutions purchased by the client, the number of client employees as well as the amount, type and timing of services provided in respect of those client employees. As such, the number of client employees on our system is not a good indicator of our financial results in any period. Recurring fees attributable to our cloud-based payroll and HCM solutions accounted for approximately 92%, 93% and 94% of our total revenues during the years ended June 30, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.\nOur agreements with clients do not have a specified term and are generally cancellable by the client on 60 days' or less notice. Our agreements do not include general rights of return and do not provide clients with the right to take possession of the software supporting the services being provided. We recognize recurring fees in the period in which services are provided and when collection of fees is reasonably assured and the amount of fees is fixed or determinable.\nInterest Income on Funds Held for Clients\nWe earn interest income on funds held for clients. We collect funds for employee payroll payments and related taxes in advance of remittance to employees and taxing authorities. Prior to remittance to employees and taxing authorities, we earn interest on these funds through financial institutions with which we have automated clearing house, or ACH, arrangements.\nImplementation Services and Other\nImplementation services and other revenues primarily consist of implementation fees charged to new clients for professional services provided to implement and configure our payroll and HCM solutions. Implementations of our payroll solutions typically require only three to four weeks at which point the new client's payroll is first run using our solution, our implementation services are deemed completed, and we recognize the related revenue. We implement additional HCM products as requested by clients and leverage the data within our payroll solution to accelerate our implementation processes. Implementation services and other revenues may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter based on the number of new clients, pricing and the product utilization.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of Recurring Revenues\nCosts of recurring revenues are generally expensed as incurred, and include costs to provide our payroll and other HCM solutions primarily consisting of employee-related expenses, including wages, stock-based compensation, bonuses and benefits, relating to the provision of ongoing client support, payroll tax filing and distribution of printed checks and other materials. These costs also include third-party reseller costs, delivery costs, computing costs and amortization of capitalized internal-use software costs, as well as bank fees associated with client fund transfers. We expect to realize cost efficiencies over the long term as our business scales, resulting in improved operating leverage and increased margins.\nWe capitalize a portion of our internal-use software costs, which are then all amortized as a cost of recurring revenues. We amortized $2.2 million, $2.6 million and $5.4 million of capitalized internal-use software costs in fiscal 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.\nCost of Implementation Services and Other\nCost of implementation services and other consists primarily of employee-related expenses, including wages, stock-based compensation, bonuses and benefits involved in the implementation of our payroll and other HCM solutions for new clients. Implementation costs are generally fixed in the short-term and exceed associated implementation revenue charged to each client. We intend to grow our business through acquisition of new clients, and doing so will require increased personnel to implement our solutions. Therefore our cost of implementation services and other is expected to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future.\nOperating Expenses\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses for our direct sales and marketing staff, including wages, commissions, stock-based compensation, bonuses and benefits, marketing expenses and other related costs. Commissions are primarily earned and recognized in the month when implementation is complete and the client first utilizes a service, typically by running its first payroll. Bonuses paid to sales staff for attainment of certain performance criteria are accrued in the fiscal year in which they are earned and are subsequently paid annually in the first fiscal quarter of the following year.\nWe will seek to grow our number of clients for the foreseeable future and therefore our sales and marketing expense is expected to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we grow our sales organization and expand our marketing activities.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses for our research and development and product management staff, including wages, stock-based compensation, bonuses and benefits. Additional expenses include costs related to the development, maintenance, quality assurance and testing of new technologies and ongoing refinement of our existing solutions. Research and development expenses, other than internal-use software costs qualifying for capitalization, are expensed as incurred.\nWe capitalize a portion of our development costs related to internal-use software. The timing of our capitalized development projects may affect the amount of development costs expensed in any given period. The table below sets forth the amounts of capitalized and expensed research and development expenses for each of fiscal 2014, 2015 and 2016.\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capitalized portion of research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $4,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $4,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $9,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expensed portion of research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,355\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26,736\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $15,029\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $24,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $36,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expect to grow our research and development efforts as we continue to broaden our product offerings and extend our technological leadership by investing in the development of new technologies and introducing them to new and existing clients. We expect research and development expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars but to vary as a percentage of total revenue on a period-to-period basis.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of other employee-related costs, including wages, stock-based compensation, bonuses and benefits for our administrative, finance, accounting, and human resources departments. Additional expenses include consulting and professional fees, occupancy costs, insurance and other corporate expenses.\nWe expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars as a result of our operation as a public company. These expenses include costs associated with regulations governing public companies, costs of directors' and officers' liability insurance and professional services expenses.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther income (expense) generally consists of interest income related to interest received on our cash and cash equivalents and disposals of property and equipment.\nResults of

We consider the policies discussed below as critical to understanding our financial statements, as their application places the most significant demands on management's judgment. Management bases its estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience, current economic and industry conditions and on various other factors deemed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Because the use of estimates is an integral part of the financial reporting process, actual results could differ and such differences could be material.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive revenues predominantly from recurring revenues associated with our cloud-based payroll and HCM software applications and one-time service fees for implementation of our solutions. Our agreements with clients do not include general rights of return and do not provide clients with the right to take possession of the software supporting the services being provided. As such, revenue is recognized as services are performed.\nWe recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are achieved:\n\u00b7 There is persuasive evidence of an agreement;\n\u00b7 The service has been provided to the client;\n\u00b7 The amount of fees to be paid by the client is fixed or determinable; and\n\u00b7 Collection of the fees is reasonably assured.\nFor arrangements with multiple-elements, we recognize revenues in accordance with Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2009-13, Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements. For each agreement, we evaluate whether the individual deliverables qualify as separate units of accounting. If one or more of the deliverables does not have standalone value upon delivery, the deliverables that do not have standalone value are generally combined and treated as a single unit of accounting. Revenue for arrangements treated as a single unit of accounting is generally recognized within the same month that the services are rendered given that the agreements are cancellable with 60 days' or less notice.\nIn determining whether revenues from implementation services can be accounted for separately from recurring revenues, we consider the nature of the implementation services and the availability of the implementation services from other vendors. We established standalone value for implementation primarily due to the number of partners that perform these services and account for such implementation services separate from the recurring revenues.\nIf we determine that the services have standalone value upon delivery, we account for each separately and revenues are recognized as the services are delivered with allocation of consideration based on the relative selling price method. That method requires the selling price of each element in a multiple deliverable arrangement to be based on, in descending order: (i) vendor- specific objective evidence of fair value, or VSOE, (ii) third-party evidence of fair value, or TPE, or (iii) management's best estimate of the selling price, or BESP.\nWe are not able to demonstrate VSOE of selling price with respect to our recurring fees paid for our solutions because the deliverables are sold across an insufficiently narrow range of prices on a stand-alone basis. We are also not able to demonstrate TPE for subscription fees because no third-party offerings are reasonably comparable to our product offerings. We thus establish BESP by service offering, requiring the use of significant estimates and judgment. To determine BESP, we consider numerous factors, including the nature of the deliverables themselves, the geography for the sale, internal costs, and pricing and discounting practices utilized by our direct sales force. Arrangement consideration is allocated to each deliverable based on the established BESP and subject to the limitation that because the arrangements are cancellable with 60 days' or less notice, recurring revenue is not allocated to any deliverable until the consideration has been earned, typically with each payroll cycle or monthly, depending on the service.\nProperty and Equipment and Long-Lived Assets\nWe state property and equipment at cost. We calculate depreciation on property and equipment using a straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to seven years for most classes of assets, or over the term of the related lease for leasehold improvements. We recognized depreciation expense of $4.1 million, $5.1 million and $6.9 million during the years ended June 30, 2014, 2015, and 2016, respectively.\nWe review long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group be tested for possible impairment, we first compare the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, we recognize impairment to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. We determine fair value through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary.\nCapitalized Internal-Use Software Costs\nWe apply ASC 350-40, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software, to the accounting for costs of internal-use software. Software development costs are capitalized when application development begins, it is probable that the project will be completed, and the software will be used as intended. Costs associated with preliminary project stage activities, training, maintenance and all other post implementation stage activities are expensed as incurred. We also capitalize certain costs related to specific upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in significant additional functionality. The capitalization policy provides for the capitalization of certain payroll costs for employees who are directly associated with developing internal-use software as well as certain external direct costs. Capitalized employee costs are limited to the time directly spent on such projects.\nInternal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over 18 to 24 months. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and test for impairments whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. There were no impairments to capitalized internal-use software during the years ended June 30, 2014, 2015 or 2016. We capitalized $4.7 million, $4.9 million, and $9.5 million of internal-use software costs for the years ended June 30, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively, including stock-based compensation costs of $0.3 million, $0.7 million and $1.1 million in the years ended June 30, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. We amortized $2.2 million, $2.6 million, and $5.4 million of capitalized internal-use software costs for the years ended June 30, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. In fiscal 2014, fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016, we developed significant additional functionality in several of our applications. This development resulted in an increase in capitalized internal-use software costs in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 and in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill is an asset representing the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized. We have recorded goodwill in connection with the acquisitions of BFKMS, Inc. and Synergy Payroll LLC. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is tested for impairment at least annually. ASU 2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment provides an entity the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount prior to performing the two-step impairment test. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, is less than its carrying amount, the two-step goodwill impairment test is required. Otherwise no further analysis is required.\nIf the two-step goodwill impairment test is required, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit. In the second step, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation and the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill. Fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. In the event the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, step two is not performed.\nWe perform our annual impairment review of goodwill in our fiscal fourth quarter or when a triggering event occurs between annual impairment tests. We did not recognize any impairment for fiscal year 2015 or 2016 as a result of our impairment tests. Given that we did not have recorded goodwill until our fiscal fourth quarter of 2014, no impairment tests were required to be completed in fiscal 2014.\nIntangible assets are comprised primarily of client list acquisitions and are reported net of accumulated amortization on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Client relationships use the straight-line method of amortization over an accelerated nine year time frame, while the non-solicitation agreements uses the straight-line method of amortization over two to three year life of the agreements. Amortization expense associated with our intangible assets was $0.1 million, $0.9 million and $1.5 million during the years ended June 30, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. We test intangible assets for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. There were no such events or changes in circumstances during the years ended June 30, 2014, 2015 and 2016.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for federal income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nDeferred tax assets may be reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we determine it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns and future profitability. Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents the best estimate of those future events. Changes in current estimates, due to unanticipated events or otherwise, could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets. The weight given to positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified. As such, it is generally difficult for positive evidence regarding projected future taxable income exclusive of reversing taxable temporary differences to outweigh objective negative evidence of recent financial reporting losses. Cumulative losses in recent years are significant negative evidence that is difficult to overcome in determining that a valuation allowance is not needed against deferred tax assets.\nWe recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (Topic 740) (\u201cASU 2015-17\u201d), which requires all deferred income tax assets and liabilities to be classified as non-current in a classified balance sheet. As allowed by ASU 2015-17, we adopted the new requirements as of June 30, 2016, on a prospective basis. The adoption of this standard resulted in a reclassification of deferred tax assets and liabilities to the non-current deferred tax liability in our consolidated balance\nsheet as of June 30, 2016. ASU 2015-17 did not have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet and had no impact on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows. No prior periods were retrospectively adjusted.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe maintain a 2008 Equity Incentive Plan (the \u201c2008 Plan\u201d) and a 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (the \u201c2014 Plan\u201d) pursuant to which we have issued options to purchase shares of our common stock and grants of restricted stock awards to employees, officers, directors and consultants. The 2014 Plan serves as the successor to the 2008 Plan and permits the granting of options to purchase common stock and other equity incentives at the discretion of the compensation committee of our board of directors. We will not grant any additional awards under our 2008 Plan, though our 2008 Plan will continue to govern the terms and conditions of all outstanding equity awards granted under the 2008 Plan.\nAs of June 30, 2016, options to purchase 3.5 million shares of our common stock were outstanding, 1.0 million restricted stock units were outstanding and 6.2 million shares of our common stock were reserved for future grant.\nThe following table presents data related to stock options granted on the dates indicated:\nTable 25: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> July 8,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Aug. 26,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Mar. 18,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Aug. 18,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Aug. 17,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Options granted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 466,663\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,065,541\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 321,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 149,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fair value of stock\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $7.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $7.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $17.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $24.80\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $35.28\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Exercise price\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $7.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $7.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $17.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $24.80\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $35.28\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fair value of option\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $1.71\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $1.71\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $7.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $11.14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $12.92\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEquity-classified awards are measured at the grant date fair value of the award and expense is recognized, net of assumed forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award. We estimate grant date fair value using the Black-Scholes Option-Pricing Model, or Black-Scholes, which requires the use of certain subjective assumptions. Below is a table of the key weighted-average assumptions used in the option valuation calculation for options issued on the dates indicated.\nTable 26: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> July 8,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Aug. 26,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Mar. 18,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Aug. 18,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Aug. 17,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Valuation assumptions:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average expected dividend yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average expected volatility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43.9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average expected term (years)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.52%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.52%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.94%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.91%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.83%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe use a dividend yield assumption of zero as we have not paid regular cash dividends on our common stock and presently have no intention of paying any such cash dividends. Since our shares were not publicly traded prior to March 2014, expected volatility is estimated based on the average historical volatility of similar entities with publicly traded shares. We calculate the expected term using company specific historical data, such as employee option exercise and employee post-vesting departure behavior. The risk-free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve at the date of grant.\nStock-based compensation expense was $4.9 million, $13.2 million and $17.6 million for the years ended June 30, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. If factors change and we employ different assumptions, stock-based compensation expense may differ from what we have recorded in the past. If there is a difference between the assumptions used in determining stock-based compensation expense and the actual factors which become known over time, we may change the input factors used in determining stock-based compensation costs for future grants. These changes, if any, may adversely impact our results of operations in the period such changes are made. We expect to continue to grant stock options in the future, and to the extent that we do, our actual stock-based compensation expense recognized in future periods will likely increase.\nOne significant factor in determining the fair value of our options granted through August 2013, when using Black-Scholes, is the fair value of the common stock underlying those stock options. Prior to March 2014, we were a private company with no active public market for our common stock. Therefore, the fair value of the common stock underlying our stock options was determined by our board of directors, which considered in making its determination of fair value a variety of factors including contemporaneous periodic valuation studies from an independent and unrelated third-party valuation firm. Now that we have a public market for our stock, we observe the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant in accordance with the terms of the award.\nBased on the closing stock price on June 30, 2016 of $43.20, the aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding options to purchase shares of our common stock as of June 30, 2016 was $108.9 million, of which $73.5 million related to vested options and $35.4 million to unvested options. The aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding restricted stock units as of June 30, 2016 was $43.3 million, of which all were unvested.\nThird-Party Valuation Methodology\nIn performing its analysis of equity awards issued prior to the initial public offering, the valuation firm engaged in discussions with management, analyzed historical and forecasted financial statements, and reviewed our corporate documents. The valuation consultant utilized the guidelines outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. The valuation study was prepared using a combination of four generally accepted approaches to determining the fair market value of a business: the discounted cash flows, or DCF, method, the guideline public company method, the prior transaction method and the market transactions method. The discounted cash flows method forecasted future cash flows utilizing a terminal value based on our expectation of long-term growth to arrive at a valuation. The guideline public company method utilizes a market approach which estimates the fair value of a company by applying to that company the market multiples of publicly-traded companies to arrive at a valuation. The prior transaction method looks to recent arms-length transactions in a company's capital stock to arrive at a valuation. The market transactions method utilizes a market approach which estimates the fair value of a company by applying to that company the market multiples of publicly-traded and private companies to arrive at a valuation.\nFiscal 2014\nThe independent third-party valuation as of May 31, 2013 was performed using the DCF method, the guideline public company method and the market transactions method. The valuation firm considered our nature and history, the condition and outlook of the industry in which we operate, the book value of our stock and our financial condition, the earning capacity of our business, the dividend-paying capacity of our business, prior transactions involving our stock, the market price of public traded stock of companies engage in the same or a similar line of business and our goodwill and intangible value. The valuation firm took into account our financial statements for fiscal 2009 through 2012, as well as interim financial statements for the eleven months ended May 31, 2013 and May 31, 2012.\nIn applying the guideline public company method, the valuation firm analyzed the prices that investors are willing to pay for the publicly-traded common stock of companies that are comparable to us. The valuation firm then calculated total market value of invested capital multiples based on TTM earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and TTM revenues. The valuation firm considered our smaller size, limited access to capital, historical and future growth expectations, and differences in liquidity, profitability and leverage among the guideline companies before selecting a TTM multiple that was slightly above the average of the TTM revenues multiples for the companies determined to be most comparable to us.\nIn applying the DCF method, the valuation firm analyzed financial projections prepared by our management for a five year period. The valuation firm calculated our net cash flows to invested capital by taking our debt-free net income, as estimated by management, adding depreciation expenses and subtracting both capital expenditures, as estimated by management, and incremental working capital needs, which were estimated based on a review of an industry average. For the terminal year, the valuation firm applied a revenue multiple, calculated using the guideline public company method. A discount rate of 35% was then applied. To determine the discount rate, the valuation firm reviewed published investment hurdle rates typically required by institutional investors for companies of comparable size and risk. The 35% discount rate was equal to the discount rate applied in the DCF analysis conducted as of June 30, 2012.\nIn applying the market transactions method, the valuation firm reviewed publicly available data regarding transactions that have occurred in the industry, as well as prior arms-length transactions in our capital stock. The valuation firm applied a revenue multiple that was slightly above the median revenue multiple of all transactions and in-line with the sale of our Series B preferred stock in June 2012.\nOur value was then allocated among our shares of Series A preferred stock, our shares of Series B preferred stock and our shares of common stock using the option pricing equity allocation method, using Black-Scholes. In utilizing the Black-Scholes method, our volatility was estimated at 31% which was based on the average volatility of the guideline public companies over a five-year period. The assumed time to expiration was four years, which was based on the estimated timing of a potential liquidity event. Finally, the valuation firm applied a marketability discount to reflect the lack of an active market in shares of our common stock, which resulted in a fair market value of $6.90 per share.\nOur board of directors considered this third-party valuation and the other factors discussed above in determining that the fair market value of our common stock was $7.04 on July 8, 2013 and August 26, 2013.\nReverse Stock Split\nOn March 5, 2014, we effected a three-for-two reverse stock split on our Common Stock.\nInitial Public Offering\nIn March 2014, we completed our initial public offering or IPO in which we issued and sold 5.4 million shares of common stock and existing shareholders sold 2.7 million shares of common stock at a public offering price of $17.00 per share. We did not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the existing shareholders. We received net proceeds of $81.9 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $6.4 million and other offering expenses of $2.9 million.\nFollow-On Offering\nIn December 2014, the Company completed a follow-on offering in which it issued and sold 0.8 million shares of common stock and existing shareholders sold 3.9 million shares of common stock at a public offering price of $26.25 per share. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the existing shareholders. The Company received net proceeds of $18.4 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $0.9 million and other offering expenses of $0.4 million.\nIn January 2015, the underwriters for the Company's follow-on offering exercised their option to purchase 0.4 million additional shares from certain shareholders of the Company of the 0.7 million available as described in the final prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) in December 2014. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the existing shareholders.\nSecondary Offering\nIn September 2015, the Company completed a secondary offering in which its existing shareholders sold 3.7 million shares of common stock at a public offering price of $29.75 per share. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the existing shareholders.\nIn October 2015, the underwriters for the Company's secondary offering exercised their option to purchase 0.6 million additional shares from certain shareholders of the Company as described in the final prospectus filed with the SEC on September 25, 2015. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the existing shareholders.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary liquidity needs are related to the funding of general business requirements, including working capital requirements, research and development, and capital expenditures. As of June 30, 2016, our principal source of liquidity was $86.5 million of cash and cash equivalents.\nIn order to grow our business, we intend to increase our personnel and related expenses and to make significant investments in our platform, data centers and infrastructure generally. The timing and amount of these investments will vary based on the rate at which we can add new clients and new personnel and the scale of our application development, data center and other activities. Many of these investments will occur in advance of our experiencing any direct benefit from them which could negatively impact our liquidity and cash flows during any particular period and may make it difficult to determine if we are effectively allocating our resources. However, we expect to fund our operations, capital expenditures and other investments principally with cash flows from operations, and to the extent that our liquidity needs exceed our cash from operations, we would look to our cash on hand and borrowing capacity to satisfy those needs.\nOur cash flows from our investing and financing activities are influenced by the amount of funds held for clients which varies significantly from quarter to quarter. The balance of the funds we hold depends on our clients' payroll calendar, and therefore such balance changes from period to period in accordance with the timing with each payroll cycle. Funds held for clients are restricted solely for the repayment of client fund obligations.\nWe believe our current cash and cash equivalents and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and other investment requirements for at least the next 12 months.\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth data regarding cash flows for the periods indicated:\nTable 27: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $7,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $11,105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $32,993\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flows from investing activities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capitalized internal-use software costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,349)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,215)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,391)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchases of property and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,667)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,020)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16,083)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Payments for acquisitions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,450)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11,979)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (483)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net change in funds held for clients\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (61,356)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (173,958)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (648,403)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (78,822)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (199,172)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (673,360)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flows from financing activities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net change in client funds obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 61,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 173,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 648,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Principal payments on long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,563)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Proceeds from initial public offering, net of issuance costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 82,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Proceeds from follow-on offering, net of issuance costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Payments on initial public offering costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (75)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital contribution\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Proceeds from exercise of stock options\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Proceeds from employee stock purchase plan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,773\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,793)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,926)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 142,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 190,477\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 645,605\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $71,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $2,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $5,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $7.2 million, $11.1 million and $33.0 million for the years ended June 30, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.\nThe increase in net cash provided by operating activities from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016 as well as from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to improved operating results after adjusting for non-cash items including stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $78.8 million, $199.2 million and $673.4 million, for the years ended June 30, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.\nChanges in net cash provided by (used in) investing activities are significantly influenced by the amount of funds held for clients at the end of a reporting period. Changes in the amount of funds held for client from period to period will vary substantially. Our payroll processing activities involves the movement of significant funds from the account of an employer to employees and relevant taxing authorities. During the year ended June 30, 2016 we processed over $74 billion in payroll transactions. Though we debit a client's account prior to any disbursement on its behalf, there is a delay between our payment of amounts due to employees and taxing and other regulatory authorities and when the incoming funds from the client to cover these amounts payable actually clear into our operating accounts. We currently have agreements with nine banks to execute ACH and wire transfers to support our client payroll and tax services. We believe we have sufficient capacity under these ACH arrangements to handle our transactions for the foreseeable future.\nExcluding the net change in funds held for clients, our net cash used in investing activities was $17.5 million, $25.2 million and $25.0 million, for the years ended June 30, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.\nThe increase in net cash used in investing activities of $474.2 million from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the timing of receipts and disbursements of cash and cash equivalents held to satisfy client funds obligations of $474.4 million, increased purchases of property and equipment by $7.1 million and increased capitalized internal-use software costs of $4.2 million, partially offset by a $11.5 million reduction in payments for acquisitions. The increase in net cash used in investing activities of $120.4 million from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the timing of receipts and disbursements of cash and cash equivalents held to\nsatisfy client funds obligations of $112.6 million, increased payments of $5.5 million to acquire certain assets of two of our resellers and increased purchases of property and equipment by $2.3 million.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $142.9 million, $190.5 million and $645.6 million for the years ended June 30, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.\nThe increase in net cash provided by financing activities of $455.1 million from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016 was primarily the result of a $474.4 million increase in funds held for clients, a $1.2 million increase in proceeds received as a result of employees' purchase of shares under the employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by $18.4 million of proceeds related to the follow-on offering, net of issuance costs during fiscal 2015 and a $2.1 million increase in taxes paid related to employees' net share settlement of equity awards. The increase in net cash provided by financing activities from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2015 was primarily the result of a $112.6 million increase in funds held for clients, $1.8 million in proceeds received as a result of employees' purchase of shares under the employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by $3.8 million in taxes paid related to employees' net share settlement of equity awards and $63.7 million year-over-year decrease in proceeds received as a result of public offerings, net of offering costs.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nOur principal commitments consist of operating lease obligations. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at June 30, 2016:\nTable 28: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payment Due By Fiscal Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2018-2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2020-2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2022 and\nThereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $111,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $5,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $14,035\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $15,949\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $75,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unconditional purchase obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,848\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $114,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $7,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $14,881\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $15,949\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $75,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital Expenditures\nWe expect to increase capital spending as we continue to grow our business and expand and enhance our data centers and technical infrastructure. Future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of sales growth. In the event that our sales growth or other factors do not meet our expectations, we may eliminate or curtail capital projects in order to mitigate the impact on our use of cash. Capital expenditures were $6.7 million, $9.0 million and $16.1 million for the years ended June 30, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively, exclusive of capitalized internal-use software costs of $4.3 million, $4.2 million, and $8.4 million for the same periods, respectively.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that may be material to investors.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (\u201cASU 2014-09\u201d). ASU 2014-09 supersedes a majority of existing revenue recognition guidance under US GAAP, and requires a company to recognize revenue when it transfers goods or services to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled. Companies may need to apply more judgment and estimation techniques or methods while recognizing revenue, which could result in additional disclosures to the financial statements. In addition, in March 2016, April 2016 and May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) (\u201cASU 2016-08\u201d), ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing (\u201cASU 2016-10\u201d) and ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients (\u201cASU 2016-12\u201d), respectively, to amend certain guidance in ASU 2014-09. Topic 606 allows for either a retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. ASU 2014-09 was originally effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. In July 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of ASU 2014-09 and all amendments to it, with a new effective date for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted as of the original effective date. The Company is currently assessing the potential effects of these changes to its consolidated financial statements and is evaluating the adoption method and timing.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (Topic 740) (\u201cASU 2015-17\u201d), which requires all deferred income tax assets and liabilities to be classified as non-current in a classified balance sheet. As allowed by ASU 2015-17, we adopted the new requirements as of June 30, 2016, on a prospective basis. The adoption of this standard resulted in a reclassification of deferred tax assets and liabilities to the non-current deferred tax liability in our consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2016. ASU 2015-17 did not have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet and had no impact on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows. No prior periods were retrospectively adjusted.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (\u201cASU 2016-02\u201d) which amends various aspects of existing guidance for leases. ASU 2016-02 requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities arising from a lease with terms greater than twelve months, along with additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures. ASU 2016-02 also requires the use of the modified retrospective method, which will require adjustment to all comparative periods presented. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the potential effects of these changes to its consolidated financial statements and is evaluating the timing of adoption.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718) (\u201cASU 2016-09\u201d) which modifies accounting for excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies, forfeitures, and employer tax withholding requirements. ASU 2016-09 also clarifies certain classifications on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the potential effects of these changes to its consolidated financial statements and is evaluating the timing of adoption.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (ASU 2016-13), which requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted as of fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently assessing the potential effects of these changes to its consolidated financial statements and is evaluating the timing of adoption.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe statements included herein that are not based solely on historical facts are \u201cforward looking statements.\u201d Such forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by us in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and under Part I, Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nWe are a cloud-based provider of payroll and human capital management or HCM software solutions for medium-sized organizations, which we define as those having between 20 and 1,000 employees. Our comprehensive and easy-to-use solutions enable our clients to manage their workforces more effectively. Our solutions help drive strategic human capital decision-making and improve employee engagement by enhancing the HR, payroll and finance capabilities of our clients.\nEffective management of human capital is a core function in all organizations and requires a significant commitment of resources. Medium-sized organizations operating without the infrastructure, expertise or personnel of larger enterprises are uniquely pressured to manage their human capital effectively.\nOur solutions were specifically designed to meet the payroll and HCM needs of medium-sized organizations. We designed our cloud-based platform to provide a unified suite of applications using a multi-tenant architecture. Our solutions are highly flexible and configurable and feature a modern, intuitive user experience. Our platform offers automated data integration with over 200 related third-party systems, such as 401(k), benefits and insurance provider systems.\nOur Paylocity Web Pay product is our core payroll solution and was the first of our current offerings introduced into the market. We believe payroll is the most critical system of record for medium-sized organizations and an essential gateway to other HCM functionality. We have invested in, and we intend to continue to invest in, research and development to expand our product offerings and advance our platform.\nWe believe there is a significant opportunity to grow our business by increasing our number of clients and we intend to invest in our business to achieve this purpose. We market and sell our solutions primarily through our direct sales force. We have increased our sales and marketing expenses as we have added sales representatives and related sales and marketing personnel. We intend to continue to grow our sales and marketing organization across new and existing geographic territories. In addition to growing our number of clients, we intend to grow our revenue over the long term by increasing the number and quality of products that clients purchase from us. To do so, we must continue to enhance and grow the number of solutions we offer to advance our platform.\nWe believe that delivering a positive service experience is an essential element of our ability to sell our solutions and retain our clients. We seek to develop deep relationships with our clients through our unified service model, which has been designed to meet the service needs of medium-sized organizations. We expect to continue to invest in and grow our implementation and client service organization as our client base grows.\nWe believe we have the opportunity to continue to grow our business over the long term, and to do so we have invested, and intend to continue to invest, across our entire organization. These investments include increasing the number of personnel across all functional areas, along with improving our solutions and infrastructure to support our growth. The timing and amount of these investments vary based on the rate at which we add new clients, add new personnel and scale our application development and other activities. Many of these investments will occur in advance of experiencing any direct benefit from them which will make it difficult to determine if we are effectively allocating our resources. We expect these investments to increase our costs on an absolute basis, but as we grow our number of clients and our related revenues, we anticipate that we will gain economies of scale and increased operating leverage. As a result, we expect our gross and operating margins will improve over the long term.\nAs our business has grown, we have become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in domestic and global economic conditions. If general economic conditions were to deteriorate further, including declines in private sector employment growth and business productivity, increases in the unemployment rate and changes in interest rates, we may experience delays in our sales cycles, increased pressure from prospective customers to offer discounts and increased pressure from existing customers to renew expiring recurring revenue agreements for lower amounts. Our interest income on funds held for clients continues to be adversely impacted by historically low interest rates.\nOur operating subsidiary Paylocity Corporation was incorporated in July 1997 as an Illinois corporation. In November 2013, we formed Paylocity Holding Corporation, a Delaware corporation, of which Paylocity Corporation is now a wholly-owned subsidiary. Paylocity Holding Corporation had no operations prior to the restructuring. All of our business operations have historically been, and are currently, conducted by Paylocity Corporation, and the financial results presented herein are attributable to the results of its operations.\nKey Metrics\nWe regularly review a number of metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions.\nRecurring Revenue Growth\nOur recurring revenue model and high annual revenue retention rates provide significant visibility into our future operating results and cash flow from operations. This visibility enables us to better manage and invest in our business. Recurring revenue, which is comprised of recurring fees and interest income on funds held for clients, increased from $101.9 million in fiscal 2014 to $144.1 million in fiscal 2015, representing a 41% year-over-year increase. Recurring revenue increased from $144.1 million in fiscal 2015 to $220.1 million in fiscal 2016, representing a 53% year-over-year increase. The increase in our recurring revenue growth was positively impacted by the launch in fiscal year 2016 of our Affordable Care Act (\u201cACA\u201d) compliance solution, which had significant penetration beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016. We expect the impact on year-over-year quarterly revenue growth of our ACA compliance solution to be highest in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 given the timing of significant penetration, beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016. Recurring revenue represented 94% of total revenue in both fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015 and 95% of total revenue in fiscal year 2016.\nClient Count Growth\nWe believe there is a significant opportunity to grow our business by increasing our number of clients. We have increased our number of clients from approximately 8,500 as of June 30, 2014 to approximately 12,500 as of June 30, 2016, representing a compound annual growth rate of approximately 21%. The table below sets forth our client count for the periods indicated, rounded to the nearest fifty.\n\nThe rate at which we add clients is highly variable period-to-period and highly seasonal as many clients switch solutions during the first calendar quarter of each year. Although many clients have multiple divisions, segments or locations, we only count such clients once for these purposes.\nAnnual Revenue Retention Rate\nOur annual revenue retention rate has been in excess of 92% during each of the past three fiscal years. We calculate our annual revenue retention rate as our total revenue for the preceding 12 months, less the annualized value of revenue lost during the preceding 12 months, divided by our total revenue for the preceding 12 months. We calculate the annualized value of revenue lost by summing the recurring fees paid by lost clients over the previous twelve months prior to their termination if they have been a client for a minimum of twelve months. For those lost clients who became clients within the last twelve months, we sum the recurring fees for the period that they have been a client and then annualize the amount. We exclude interest income on funds held for clients from the revenue retention calculation. We believe that our annual revenue retention rate is an important metric to measure overall client satisfaction and the general quality of our product and service offerings.\nRecurring Fees From New Clients\nWe calculate recurring fees from new clients as the percentage of year-to-date recurring fees from all clients on our solutions which had not been on or used any of our solutions for a full year as of the start of the current fiscal year. We believe recurring fees from new clients is an important metric to measure the expansion of our existing client base as well as the growth in our client base. Our recurring fees from new clients was 44% for fiscal 2014 and 45% for both fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016.\nAdjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Recurring Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA\nWe disclose Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Recurring Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA because we use them to evaluate our performance, and we believe Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Recurring Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA assist in the comparison of our performance across reporting periods by excluding certain items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. We believe these metrics are used in the financial community, and we present it to enhance investors' understanding of our operating performance and cash flows.\nAdjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Recurring Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP, and you should not consider Adjusted Gross Profit as an alternative to gross profit, Adjusted Recurring Gross Profit as an alternative to total recurring revenues, or Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative to net income (loss) or cash provided by (used in) operating activities, in each case as determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our definition of Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Recurring Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA may be different than the definition utilized for similarly-titled measures used by other companies.\nWe define Adjusted Gross Profit as gross profit before amortization of capitalized internal-use software costs, stock-based compensation expense and employer payroll taxes related to stock releases and option exercises and one-time founder funded bonus pay-outs, if any. We define Adjusted Recurring Gross Profit as total recurring revenues after cost of recurring revenues and before amortization of capitalized internal-use software costs, stock-based compensation expense and employer payroll taxes related to stock releases and option exercises and one-time founder funded bonus pay-outs, if any. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense and employer payroll taxes related to stock releases and option exercises and one-time founder funded bonus pay-outs, if any. The table below sets forth our Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Recurring Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented.\n\nFor a further discussion of Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Recurring Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA, including a reconciliation of Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Recurring Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP, see Part II, Item 6: \u201cConsolidated Selected Financial Data.\u201d\nBasis of Presentation\nRevenues\nRecurring Fees\nWe derive the majority of our revenues from recurring fees attributable to our cloud-based payroll and HCM software solutions. Recurring fees for each client generally include a base fee in addition to a fee based on the number of client employees and the number of products a client uses. We also charge fees attributable to our preparation of W-2 documents and annual required filings on behalf of our clients. Over the past three years, our client size has been on average over 100 employees. We derive revenue from a client based on the solutions purchased by the client, the number of client employees as well as the amount, type and timing of services provided in respect of those client employees. As such, the number of client employees on our system is not a good indicator of our financial results in any period. Recurring fees attributable to our cloud-based payroll and HCM solutions accounted for approximately 92%, 93% and 94% of our total revenues during the years ended June 30, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.\nOur agreements with clients do not have a specified term and are generally cancellable by the client on 60 days' or less notice. Our agreements do not include general rights of return and do not provide clients with the right to take possession of the software supporting the services being provided. We recognize recurring fees in the period in which services are provided and when collection of fees is reasonably assured and the amount of fees is fixed or determinable.\nInterest Income on Funds Held for Clients\nWe earn interest income on funds held for clients. We collect funds for employee payroll payments and related taxes in advance of remittance to employees and taxing authorities. Prior to remittance to employees and taxing authorities, we earn interest on these funds through financial institutions with which we have automated clearing house, or ACH, arrangements.\nImplementation Services and Other\nImplementation services and other revenues primarily consist of implementation fees charged to new clients for professional services provided to implement and configure our payroll and HCM solutions. Implementations of our payroll solutions typically require only three to four weeks at which point the new client's payroll is first run using our solution, our implementation services are deemed completed, and we recognize the related revenue. We implement additional HCM products as requested by clients and leverage the data within our payroll solution to accelerate our implementation processes. Implementation services and other revenues may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter based on the number of new clients, pricing and the product utilization.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of Recurring Revenues\nCosts of recurring revenues are generally expensed as incurred, and include costs to provide our payroll and other HCM solutions primarily consisting of employee-related expenses, including wages, stock-based compensation, bonuses and benefits, relating to the provision of ongoing client support, payroll tax filing and distribution of printed checks and other materials. These costs also include third-party reseller costs, delivery costs, computing costs and amortization of capitalized internal-use software costs, as well as bank fees associated with client fund transfers. We expect to realize cost efficiencies over the long term as our business scales, resulting in improved operating leverage and increased margins.\nWe capitalize a portion of our internal-use software costs, which are then all amortized as a cost of recurring revenues. We amortized $2.2 million, $2.6 million and $5.4 million of capitalized internal-use software costs in fiscal 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.\nCost of Implementation Services and Other\nCost of implementation services and other consists primarily of employee-related expenses, including wages, stock-based compensation, bonuses and benefits involved in the implementation of our payroll and other HCM solutions for new clients. Implementation costs are generally fixed in the short-term and exceed associated implementation revenue charged to each client. We intend to grow our business through acquisition of new clients, and doing so will require increased personnel to implement our solutions. Therefore our cost of implementation services and other is expected to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future.\nOperating Expenses\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses for our direct sales and marketing staff, including wages, commissions, stock-based compensation, bonuses and benefits, marketing expenses and other related costs. Commissions are primarily earned and recognized in the month when implementation is complete and the client first utilizes a service, typically by running its first payroll. Bonuses paid to sales staff for attainment of certain performance criteria are accrued in the fiscal year in which they are earned and are subsequently paid annually in the first fiscal quarter of the following year.\nWe will seek to grow our number of clients for the foreseeable future and therefore our sales and marketing expense is expected to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we grow our sales organization and expand our marketing activities.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses for our research and development and product management staff, including wages, stock-based compensation, bonuses and benefits. Additional expenses include costs related to the development, maintenance, quality assurance and testing of new technologies and ongoing refinement of our existing solutions. Research and development expenses, other than internal-use software costs qualifying for capitalization, are expensed as incurred.\nWe capitalize a portion of our development costs related to internal-use software. The timing of our capitalized development projects may affect the amount of development costs expensed in any given period. The table below sets forth the amounts of capitalized and expensed research and development expenses for each of fiscal 2014, 2015 and 2016.\n\nWe expect to grow our research and development efforts as we continue to broaden our product offerings and extend our technological leadership by investing in the development of new technologies and introducing them to new and existing clients. We expect research and development expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars but to vary as a percentage of total revenue on a period-to-period basis.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of other employee-related costs, including wages, stock-based compensation, bonuses and benefits for our administrative, finance, accounting, and human resources departments. Additional expenses include consulting and professional fees, occupancy costs, insurance and other corporate expenses.\nWe expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars as a result of our operation as a public company. These expenses include costs associated with regulations governing public companies, costs of directors' and officers' liability insurance and professional services expenses.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther income (expense) generally consists of interest income related to interest received on our cash and cash equivalents and disposals of property and equipment.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our statements of operations data for each of the periods indicated.\n\nThe following table sets forth our statements of operations data as a percentage of total revenue for each of the periods indicated.\n\nComparison of Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2014, 2015 and 2016\nRevenues\n($ in thousands)\n\nRecurring Fees\nRecurring fees for the year ended June 30, 2016 increased by $75.2 million, or 53%, to $217.4 million from $142.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. Recurring fees increased primarily as a result of incremental revenues from new and existing clients, including revenue related to our Affordable Care Act (\u201cACA\u201d) compliance solution offered to new and existing clients, which we launched in fiscal year 2016. Our client count at June 30, 2016 increased by 21% to approximately 12,500 from approximately 10,350 at June 30, 2015.\nRecurring fees for the year ended June 30, 2015 increased by $41.8 million, or 42%, to $142.2 million from $100.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2014. Recurring fees increased primarily as a result of the continued growth of our client base in fiscal 2015, as well as increased revenue per client. Our client count at June 30, 2015 increased by 22% to approximately 10,350 from approximately 8,500 at June 30, 2014.\nInterest Income on Funds Held for Clients\nInterest income on funds held for clients for the year ended June 30, 2016 increased by $0.8 million, or 41%, to $2.7 million from $1.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. Interest income increased primarily as a result of an increased average daily balance of funds held due to the addition of new clients to our client base.\nInterest income on funds held for clients for the year ended June 30, 2015 increased by $0.3 million, or 20%, to $1.9 million from $1.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2014. Interest income increased primarily as a result of an increased average daily balance of funds held due to the addition of new clients to our client base.\nImplementation Services and Other\nImplementation services and other revenue for the year ended June 30, 2016 increased by $2.0 million, or 23%, to $10.6 million from $8.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. Implementation services and other revenue increased primarily as a result of an increase in the number of new clients during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015.\nImplementation services and other revenue for the year ended June 30, 2015 increased by $1.9 million, or 28%, to $8.6 million from $6.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2014. Implementation services and other revenue increased primarily as a result of the continued growth of our new client base during fiscal 2015.\nCost of Revenues\n($ in thousands)\n\nCost of Recurring Revenues\nCost of recurring revenues for the year ended June 30, 2016 increased by $19.8 million, or 43%, to $66.1 million from $46.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. Cost of recurring revenues increased primarily as a result of the continued growth of our business, in particular $10.8 million in additional employee-related costs resulting from additional personnel to provide services to new and existing clients, $8.3 million in delivery and other processing-related fees and $2.8 million in increased internal-use software amortization, partially offset by a $2.3 million decrease in reseller expenses primarily due to our acquisition of our remaining reseller during fiscal 2015. Recurring gross margin increased by 2% from 68% in fiscal 2015 to 70% in fiscal 2016 primarily due to a 2% reduction in reseller expenses as a percentage of total recurring revenue.\nCost of recurring revenues for the year ended June 30, 2015 increased by $9.0 million, or 24%, to $46.4 million from $37.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2014. Cost of recurring revenues increased primarily as a result of the continued growth of our business, in particular $5.3 million in additional employee-related costs resulting from additional personnel to provide services to new and existing clients, $1.0 million stock-based compensation associated with our equity incentive plan, and $4.5 million other processing-related fees, partially offset by a $2.2 million decline in costs attributable to resellers. Recurring gross margin increased by 5% from 63% in fiscal 2014 to 68% in fiscal 2015 primarily due to a 3% reduction in costs attributable to resellers as a percentage of total recurring revenue and 1% decreases in both employee-related and processing-related costs.\nCost of Implementation Services and Other\nCost of implementation services and other for the year ended June 30, 2016 increased by $7.4 million, or 30%, to $32.0 million from $24.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. Cost of implementation services and other increased primarily due to an increase in new clients during fiscal 2016, and a corresponding increase of $7.5 million in employee-related costs to implement our solutions for new and existing clients.\nCost of implementation services and other for the year ended June 30, 2015 increased by $6.8 million, or 38%, to $24.5 million from $17.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2014. Cost of implementation services and other increased primarily due to an increase in new clients during fiscal 2015, and a corresponding increase of $5.2 million in employee-related costs to implement our solutions for new clients and $0.8 million stock-based compensation associated with our equity incentive plan.\nOperating Expenses\n($ in thousands)\nSales and Marketing\n\nSales and marketing expenses for the year ended June 30, 2016 increased by $18.8 million, or 44%, to $61.8 million from $43.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal 2016 was primarily the result of $15.6 million of additional employee-related costs from the expansion of our sales force by 75 personnel (including management, sales engineers, direct sales and sales administration), our sales lead generation group by 14 personnel and our marketing team by 3 personnel. The increase was also attributable to $1.2 million of stock-based compensation associated with our equity incentive plan.\nSales and marketing expenses for the year ended June 30, 2015 increased by $14.8 million, or 52%, to $43.0 million from $28.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2014. The increase in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal 2015 was primarily the result of $12.0 million of additional employee-related costs from the expansion of our sales team including management, direct sales and sales administration personnel by 34 personnel, the addition of 26 sales lead generation personnel and other miscellaneous sales and marketing related expenses. The increase was also attributable to $2.5 million of stock-based compensation associated with our equity incentive plan.\nResearch and Development\n\nResearch and development for the year ended June 30, 2016 increased by $6.9 million, or 35%, to $26.7 million from $19.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. Research and development costs increased in fiscal 2016 primarily due to $9.9 million of additional employee-related expenses related to 54 additional development personnel, partially offset by higher year-over-year capitalized internal-use software costs of $4.2 million.\nResearch and development for the year ended June 30, 2015 increased by $9.5 million, or 92%, to $19.9 million from $10.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2014. Research and development costs increased in fiscal 2015 primarily due to $7.5 million of additional employee-related expenses related to 64 additional development personnel and $2.2 million of stock-based compensation associated with our equity incentive plan. This was offset by an increase of $0.2 million in our capitalized internal-use software costs.\nGeneral and Administrative\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 2016 increased by $14.8 million, or 45%, to $47.6 million from $32.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. General and administrative expenses increased primarily as a result of $6.7 million of additional employee-related expenses relating to 36 additional personnel, $2.9 million of additional stock-based compensation costs, $1.5 million of increased occupancy costs incurred as a result of our requirement for additional office space and $1.3 million of increased professional services fees.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 2015 increased by $10.8 million, or 49%, to $32.8 million from $22.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2014. General and administrative expenses increased primarily as a result of $5.0 million of additional employee-related expenses relating to 30 additional personnel, $2.0 million of additional stock-based compensation costs, $1.5 million of increased occupancy costs incurred as a result of our requirement for additional office space, $0.8 million of amortization expense of the customer relationship and non-compete intangibles associated with acquisitions of both of our\nresellers, $0.7 million of increased insurance costs associated with being a public company, and $0.3 million in additional professional fees.\nOther Income (Expense)\n\n* Not Meaningful\nOther income (expense) for the year ended June 30, 2016 decreased by $0.2 million as compared to the year ended June 30, 2015. Other income (expense) for the year ended June 30, 2016 primarily consists of loss on the disposal of property and equipment, partially offset by interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents.\nOther income (expense) for the year ended June 30, 2015 decreased by $0.1 million as compared to the year ended June 30, 2014. Other income for the year ended June 30, 2015 primarily consists of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents partially offset by loss on the disposal of property and equipment.\nIncome Tax Expense\n\n* Not Meaningful\nIncome tax expense for the year ended June 30, 2016 was not materially different as compared to the year ended June 30, 2015.\nIncome tax expense for the year ended June 30, 2015 decreased by $0.2 million, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2014 primarily due to the recognition of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance during the year ended June 30, 2014 related to net deferred tax balances generated in prior years.\nSee Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8: \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details on the valuation allowance and a reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nIn preparing our financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances in accordance with GAAP, we apply various accounting policies that require our management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements. We consider the policies discussed below as critical to understanding our financial statements, as their application places the most significant demands on management's judgment. Management bases its estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience, current economic and industry conditions and on various other factors deemed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Because the use of estimates is an integral part of the financial reporting process, actual results could differ and such differences could be material.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive revenues predominantly from recurring revenues associated with our cloud-based payroll and HCM software applications and one-time service fees for implementation of our solutions. Our agreements with clients do not include general rights of return and do not provide clients with the right to take possession of the software supporting the services being provided. As such, revenue is recognized as services are performed.\nWe recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are achieved:\n\u00b7 There is persuasive evidence of an agreement;\n\u00b7 The service has been provided to the client;\n\u00b7 The amount of fees to be paid by the client is fixed or determinable; and\n\u00b7 Collection of the fees is reasonably assured.\nFor arrangements with multiple-elements, we recognize revenues in accordance with Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2009-13, Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements. For each agreement, we evaluate whether the individual deliverables qualify as separate units of accounting. If one or more of the deliverables does not have standalone value upon delivery, the deliverables that do not have standalone value are generally combined and treated as a single unit of accounting. Revenue for arrangements treated as a single unit of accounting is generally recognized within the same month that the services are rendered given that the agreements are cancellable with 60 days' or less notice.\nIn determining whether revenues from implementation services can be accounted for separately from recurring revenues, we consider the nature of the implementation services and the availability of the implementation services from other vendors. We established standalone value for implementation primarily due to the number of partners that perform these services and account for such implementation services separate from the recurring revenues.\nIf we determine that the services have standalone value upon delivery, we account for each separately and revenues are recognized as the services are delivered with allocation of consideration based on the relative selling price method. That method requires the selling price of each element in a multiple deliverable arrangement to be based on, in descending order: (i) vendor- specific objective evidence of fair value, or VSOE, (ii) third-party evidence of fair value, or TPE, or (iii) management's best estimate of the selling price, or BESP.\nWe are not able to demonstrate VSOE of selling price with respect to our recurring fees paid for our solutions because the deliverables are sold across an insufficiently narrow range of prices on a stand-alone basis. We are also not able to demonstrate TPE for subscription fees because no third-party offerings are reasonably comparable to our product offerings. We thus establish BESP by service offering, requiring the use of significant estimates and judgment. To determine BESP, we consider numerous factors, including the nature of the deliverables themselves, the geography for the sale, internal costs, and pricing and discounting practices utilized by our direct sales force. Arrangement consideration is allocated to each deliverable based on the established BESP and subject to the limitation that because the arrangements are cancellable with 60 days' or less notice, recurring revenue is not allocated to any deliverable until the consideration has been earned, typically with each payroll cycle or monthly, depending on the service.\nProperty and Equipment and Long-Lived Assets\nWe state property and equipment at cost. We calculate depreciation on property and equipment using a straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to seven years for most classes of assets, or over the term of the related lease for leasehold improvements. We recognized depreciation expense of $4.1 million, $5.1 million and $6.9 million during the years ended June 30, 2014, 2015, and 2016, respectively.\nWe review long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group be tested for possible impairment, we first compare the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, we recognize impairment to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. We determine fair value through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary.\nCapitalized Internal-Use Software Costs\nWe apply ASC 350-40, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software, to the accounting for costs of internal-use software. Software development costs are capitalized when application development begins, it is probable that the project will be completed, and the software will be used as intended. Costs associated with preliminary project stage activities, training, maintenance and all other post implementation stage activities are expensed as incurred. We also capitalize certain costs related to specific upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in significant additional functionality. The capitalization policy provides for the capitalization of certain payroll costs for employees who are directly associated with developing internal-use software as well as certain external direct costs. Capitalized employee costs are limited to the time directly spent on such projects.\nInternal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over 18 to 24 months. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and test for impairments whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. There were no impairments to capitalized internal-use software during the years ended June 30, 2014, 2015 or 2016. We capitalized $4.7 million, $4.9 million, and $9.5 million of internal-use software costs for the years ended June 30, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively, including stock-based compensation costs of $0.3 million, $0.7 million and $1.1 million in the years ended June 30, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. We amortized $2.2 million, $2.6 million, and $5.4 million of capitalized internal-use software costs for the years ended June 30, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. In fiscal 2014, fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016, we developed significant additional functionality in several of our applications. This development resulted in an increase in capitalized internal-use software costs in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 and in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill is an asset representing the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized. We have recorded goodwill in connection with the acquisitions of BFKMS, Inc. and Synergy Payroll LLC. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is tested for impairment at least annually. ASU 2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment provides an entity the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount prior to performing the two-step impairment test. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, is less than its carrying amount, the two-step goodwill impairment test is required. Otherwise no further analysis is required.\nIf the two-step goodwill impairment test is required, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit. In the second step, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation and the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill. Fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. In the event the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, step two is not performed.\nWe perform our annual impairment review of goodwill in our fiscal fourth quarter or when a triggering event occurs between annual impairment tests. We did not recognize any impairment for fiscal year 2015 or 2016 as a result of our impairment tests. Given that we did not have recorded goodwill until our fiscal fourth quarter of 2014, no impairment tests were required to be completed in fiscal 2014.\nIntangible assets are comprised primarily of client list acquisitions and are reported net of accumulated amortization on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Client relationships use the straight-line method of amortization over an accelerated nine year time frame, while the non-solicitation agreements uses the straight-line method of amortization over two to three year life of the agreements. Amortization expense associated with our intangible assets was $0.1 million, $0.9 million and $1.5 million during the years ended June 30, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. We test intangible assets for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. There were no such events or changes in circumstances during the years ended June 30, 2014, 2015 and 2016.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for federal income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nDeferred tax assets may be reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we determine it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns and future profitability. Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents the best estimate of those future events. Changes in current estimates, due to unanticipated events or otherwise, could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets. The weight given to positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified. As such, it is generally difficult for positive evidence regarding projected future taxable income exclusive of reversing taxable temporary differences to outweigh objective negative evidence of recent financial reporting losses. Cumulative losses in recent years are significant negative evidence that is difficult to overcome in determining that a valuation allowance is not needed against deferred tax assets.\nWe recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (Topic 740) (\u201cASU 2015-17\u201d), which requires all deferred income tax assets and liabilities to be classified as non-current in a classified balance sheet. As allowed by ASU 2015-17, we adopted the new requirements as of June 30, 2016, on a prospective basis. The adoption of this standard resulted in a reclassification of deferred tax assets and liabilities to the non-current deferred tax liability in our consolidated balance\nsheet as of June 30, 2016. ASU 2015-17 did not have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet and had no impact on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows. No prior periods were retrospectively adjusted.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe maintain a 2008 Equity Incentive Plan (the \u201c2008 Plan\u201d) and a 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (the \u201c2014 Plan\u201d) pursuant to which we have issued options to purchase shares of our common stock and grants of restricted stock awards to employees, officers, directors and consultants. The 2014 Plan serves as the successor to the 2008 Plan and permits the granting of options to purchase common stock and other equity incentives at the discretion of the compensation committee of our board of directors. We will not grant any additional awards under our 2008 Plan, though our 2008 Plan will continue to govern the terms and conditions of all outstanding equity awards granted under the 2008 Plan.\nAs of June 30, 2016, options to purchase 3.5 million shares of our common stock were outstanding, 1.0 million restricted stock units were outstanding and 6.2 million shares of our common stock were reserved for future grant.\nThe following table presents data related to stock options granted on the dates indicated:\n\nEquity-classified awards are measured at the grant date fair value of the award and expense is recognized, net of assumed forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award. We estimate grant date fair value using the Black-Scholes Option-Pricing Model, or Black-Scholes, which requires the use of certain subjective assumptions. Below is a table of the key weighted-average assumptions used in the option valuation calculation for options issued on the dates indicated.\n\nWe use a dividend yield assumption of zero as we have not paid regular cash dividends on our common stock and presently have no intention of paying any such cash dividends. Since our shares were not publicly traded prior to March 2014, expected volatility is estimated based on the average historical volatility of similar entities with publicly traded shares. We calculate the expected term using company specific historical data, such as employee option exercise and employee post-vesting departure behavior. The risk-free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve at the date of grant.\nStock-based compensation expense was $4.9 million, $13.2 million and $17.6 million for the years ended June 30, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. If factors change and we employ different assumptions, stock-based compensation expense may differ from what we have recorded in the past. If there is a difference between the assumptions used in determining stock-based compensation expense and the actual factors which become known over time, we may change the input factors used in determining stock-based compensation costs for future grants. These changes, if any, may adversely impact our results of operations in the period such changes are made. We expect to continue to grant stock options in the future, and to the extent that we do, our actual stock-based compensation expense recognized in future periods will likely increase.\nOne significant factor in determining the fair value of our options granted through August 2013, when using Black-Scholes, is the fair value of the common stock underlying those stock options. Prior to March 2014, we were a private company with no active public market for our common stock. Therefore, the fair value of the common stock underlying our stock options was determined by our board of directors, which considered in making its determination of fair value a variety of factors including contemporaneous periodic valuation studies from an independent and unrelated third-party valuation firm. Now that we have a public market for our stock, we observe the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant in accordance with the terms of the award.\nBased on the closing stock price on June 30, 2016 of $43.20, the aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding options to purchase shares of our common stock as of June 30, 2016 was $108.9 million, of which $73.5 million related to vested options and $35.4 million to unvested options. The aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding restricted stock units as of June 30, 2016 was $43.3 million, of which all were unvested.\nThird-Party Valuation Methodology\nIn performing its analysis of equity awards issued prior to the initial public offering, the valuation firm engaged in discussions with management, analyzed historical and forecasted financial statements, and reviewed our corporate documents. The valuation consultant utilized the guidelines outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. The valuation study was prepared using a combination of four generally accepted approaches to determining the fair market value of a business: the discounted cash flows, or DCF, method, the guideline public company method, the prior transaction method and the market transactions method. The discounted cash flows method forecasted future cash flows utilizing a terminal value based on our expectation of long-term growth to arrive at a valuation. The guideline public company method utilizes a market approach which estimates the fair value of a company by applying to that company the market multiples of publicly-traded companies to arrive at a valuation. The prior transaction method looks to recent arms-length transactions in a company's capital stock to arrive at a valuation. The market transactions method utilizes a market approach which estimates the fair value of a company by applying to that company the market multiples of publicly-traded and private companies to arrive at a valuation.\nFiscal 2014\nThe independent third-party valuation as of May 31, 2013 was performed using the DCF method, the guideline public company method and the market transactions method. The valuation firm considered our nature and history, the condition and outlook of the industry in which we operate, the book value of our stock and our financial condition, the earning capacity of our business, the dividend-paying capacity of our business, prior transactions involving our stock, the market price of public traded stock of companies engage in the same or a similar line of business and our goodwill and intangible value. The valuation firm took into account our financial statements for fiscal 2009 through 2012, as well as interim financial statements for the eleven months ended May 31, 2013 and May 31, 2012.\nIn applying the guideline public company method, the valuation firm analyzed the prices that investors are willing to pay for the publicly-traded common stock of companies that are comparable to us. The valuation firm then calculated total market value of invested capital multiples based on TTM earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and TTM revenues. The valuation firm considered our smaller size, limited access to capital, historical and future growth expectations, and differences in liquidity, profitability and leverage among the guideline companies before selecting a TTM multiple that was slightly above the average of the TTM revenues multiples for the companies determined to be most comparable to us.\nIn applying the DCF method, the valuation firm analyzed financial projections prepared by our management for a five year period. The valuation firm calculated our net cash flows to invested capital by taking our debt-free net income, as estimated by management, adding depreciation expenses and subtracting both capital expenditures, as estimated by management, and incremental working capital needs, which were estimated based on a review of an industry average. For the terminal year, the valuation firm applied a revenue multiple, calculated using the guideline public company method. A discount rate of 35% was then applied. To determine the discount rate, the valuation firm reviewed published investment hurdle rates typically required by institutional investors for companies of comparable size and risk. The 35% discount rate was equal to the discount rate applied in the DCF analysis conducted as of June 30, 2012.\nIn applying the market transactions method, the valuation firm reviewed publicly available data regarding transactions that have occurred in the industry, as well as prior arms-length transactions in our capital stock. The valuation firm applied a revenue multiple that was slightly above the median revenue multiple of all transactions and in-line with the sale of our Series B preferred stock in June 2012.\nOur value was then allocated among our shares of Series A preferred stock, our shares of Series B preferred stock and our shares of common stock using the option pricing equity allocation method, using Black-Scholes. In utilizing the Black-Scholes method, our volatility was estimated at 31% which was based on the average volatility of the guideline public companies over a five-year period. The assumed time to expiration was four years, which was based on the estimated timing of a potential liquidity event. Finally, the valuation firm applied a marketability discount to reflect the lack of an active market in shares of our common stock, which resulted in a fair market value of $6.90 per share.\nOur board of directors considered this third-party valuation and the other factors discussed above in determining that the fair market value of our common stock was $7.04 on July 8, 2013 and August 26, 2013.\nReverse Stock Split\nOn March 5, 2014, we effected a three-for-two reverse stock split on our Common Stock.\nInitial Public Offering\nIn March 2014, we completed our initial public offering or IPO in which we issued and sold 5.4 million shares of common stock and existing shareholders sold 2.7 million shares of common stock at a public offering price of $17.00 per share. We did not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the existing shareholders. We received net proceeds of $81.9 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $6.4 million and other offering expenses of $2.9 million.\nFollow-On Offering\nIn December 2014, the Company completed a follow-on offering in which it issued and sold 0.8 million shares of common stock and existing shareholders sold 3.9 million shares of common stock at a public offering price of $26.25 per share. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the existing shareholders. The Company received net proceeds of $18.4 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $0.9 million and other offering expenses of $0.4 million.\nIn January 2015, the underwriters for the Company's follow-on offering exercised their option to purchase 0.4 million additional shares from certain shareholders of the Company of the 0.7 million available as described in the final prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) in December 2014. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the existing shareholders.\nSecondary Offering\nIn September 2015, the Company completed a secondary offering in which its existing shareholders sold 3.7 million shares of common stock at a public offering price of $29.75 per share. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the existing shareholders.\nIn October 2015, the underwriters for the Company's secondary offering exercised their option to purchase 0.6 million additional shares from certain shareholders of the Company as described in the final prospectus filed with the SEC on September 25, 2015. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the existing shareholders.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary liquidity needs are related to the funding of general business requirements, including working capital requirements, research and development, and capital expenditures. As of June 30, 2016, our principal source of liquidity was $86.5 million of cash and cash equivalents.\nIn order to grow our business, we intend to increase our personnel and related expenses and to make significant investments in our platform, data centers and infrastructure generally. The timing and amount of these investments will vary based on the rate at which we can add new clients and new personnel and the scale of our application development, data center and other activities. Many of these investments will occur in advance of our experiencing any direct benefit from them which could negatively impact our liquidity and cash flows during any particular period and may make it difficult to determine if we are effectively allocating our resources. However, we expect to fund our operations, capital expenditures and other investments principally with cash flows from operations, and to the extent that our liquidity needs exceed our cash from operations, we would look to our cash on hand and borrowing capacity to satisfy those needs.\nOur cash flows from our investing and financing activities are influenced by the amount of funds held for clients which varies significantly from quarter to quarter. The balance of the funds we hold depends on our clients' payroll calendar, and therefore such balance changes from period to period in accordance with the timing with each payroll cycle. Funds held for clients are restricted solely for the repayment of client fund obligations.\nWe believe our current cash and cash equivalents and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and other investment requirements for at least the next 12 months.\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth data regarding cash flows for the periods indicated:\n\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $7.2 million, $11.1 million and $33.0 million for the years ended June 30, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.\nThe increase in net cash provided by operating activities from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016 as well as from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to improved operating results after adjusting for non-cash items including stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $78.8 million, $199.2 million and $673.4 million, for the years ended June 30, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.\nChanges in net cash provided by (used in) investing activities are significantly influenced by the amount of funds held for clients at the end of a reporting period. Changes in the amount of funds held for client from period to period will vary substantially. Our payroll processing activities involves the movement of significant funds from the account of an employer to employees and relevant taxing authorities. During the year ended June 30, 2016 we processed over $74 billion in payroll transactions. Though we debit a client's account prior to any disbursement on its behalf, there is a delay between our payment of amounts due to employees and taxing and other regulatory authorities and when the incoming funds from the client to cover these amounts payable actually clear into our operating accounts. We currently have agreements with nine banks to execute ACH and wire transfers to support our client payroll and tax services. We believe we have sufficient capacity under these ACH arrangements to handle our transactions for the foreseeable future.\nExcluding the net change in funds held for clients, our net cash used in investing activities was $17.5 million, $25.2 million and $25.0 million, for the years ended June 30, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.\nThe increase in net cash used in investing activities of $474.2 million from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the timing of receipts and disbursements of cash and cash equivalents held to satisfy client funds obligations of $474.4 million, increased purchases of property and equipment by $7.1 million and increased capitalized internal-use software costs of $4.2 million, partially offset by a $11.5 million reduction in payments for acquisitions. The increase in net cash used in investing activities of $120.4 million from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the timing of receipts and disbursements of cash and cash equivalents held to\nsatisfy client funds obligations of $112.6 million, increased payments of $5.5 million to acquire certain assets of two of our resellers and increased purchases of property and equipment by $2.3 million.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $142.9 million, $190.5 million and $645.6 million for the years ended June 30, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.\nThe increase in net cash provided by financing activities of $455.1 million from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016 was primarily the result of a $474.4 million increase in funds held for clients, a $1.2 million increase in proceeds received as a result of employees' purchase of shares under the employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by $18.4 million of proceeds related to the follow-on offering, net of issuance costs during fiscal 2015 and a $2.1 million increase in taxes paid related to employees' net share settlement of equity awards. The increase in net cash provided by financing activities from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2015 was primarily the result of a $112.6 million increase in funds held for clients, $1.8 million in proceeds received as a result of employees' purchase of shares under the employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by $3.8 million in taxes paid related to employees' net share settlement of equity awards and $63.7 million year-over-year decrease in proceeds received as a result of public offerings, net of offering costs.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nOur principal commitments consist of operating lease obligations. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at June 30, 2016:\n\nCapital Expenditures\nWe expect to increase capital spending as we continue to grow our business and expand and enhance our data centers and technical infrastructure. Future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of sales growth. In the event that our sales growth or other factors do not meet our expectations, we may eliminate or curtail capital projects in order to mitigate the impact on our use of cash. Capital expenditures were $6.7 million, $9.0 million and $16.1 million for the years ended June 30, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively, exclusive of capitalized internal-use software costs of $4.3 million, $4.2 million, and $8.4 million for the same periods, respectively.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that may be material to investors.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (\u201cASU 2014-09\u201d). ASU 2014-09 supersedes a majority of existing revenue recognition guidance under US GAAP, and requires a company to recognize revenue when it transfers goods or services to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled. Companies may need to apply more judgment and estimation techniques or methods while recognizing revenue, which could result in additional disclosures to the financial statements. In addition, in March 2016, April 2016 and May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) (\u201cASU 2016-08\u201d), ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing (\u201cASU 2016-10\u201d) and ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients (\u201cASU 2016-12\u201d), respectively, to amend certain guidance in ASU 2014-09. Topic 606 allows for either a retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. ASU 2014-09 was originally effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. In July 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of ASU 2014-09 and all amendments to it, with a new effective date for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted as of the original effective date. The Company is currently assessing the potential effects of these changes to its consolidated financial statements and is evaluating the adoption method and timing.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (Topic 740) (\u201cASU 2015-17\u201d), which requires all deferred income tax assets and liabilities to be classified as non-current in a classified balance sheet. As allowed by ASU 2015-17, we adopted the new requirements as of June 30, 2016, on a prospective basis. The adoption of this standard resulted in a reclassification of deferred tax assets and liabilities to the non-current deferred tax liability in our consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2016. ASU 2015-17 did not have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet and had no impact on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows. No prior periods were retrospectively adjusted.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (\u201cASU 2016-02\u201d) which amends various aspects of existing guidance for leases. ASU 2016-02 requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities arising from a lease with terms greater than twelve months, along with additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures. ASU 2016-02 also requires the use of the modified retrospective method, which will require adjustment to all comparative periods presented. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the potential effects of these changes to its consolidated financial statements and is evaluating the timing of adoption.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718) (\u201cASU 2016-09\u201d) which modifies accounting for excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies, forfeitures, and employer tax withholding requirements. ASU 2016-09 also clarifies certain classifications on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the potential effects of these changes to its consolidated financial statements and is evaluating the timing of adoption.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (ASU 2016-13), which requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted as of fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently assessing the potential effects of these changes to its consolidated financial statements and is evaluating the timing of adoption.", "item_7_tables": "Table 13: <table> <tr>

(MD&A) report from a cloud-based provider of payroll and human capital management (HCM) software solutions, Paylocity Holding Corporation, and its subsidiary, Paylocity Corporation. The summary of the key points from the report is as follows:\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements Disclaimer:**\nStatements in the MD&A that aren't purely historical are \"forward-looking statements\" and are subject to risks and uncertainties, meaning actual results could differ from those anticipated.\n\n**Company Overview:**\nPaylocity provides cloud-based payroll and HCM software solutions for medium-sized organizations (20 - 1,000 employees). Their platform offers a unified suite of applications that are configurable, flexible, and integrated with third-party systems.\n\n**Market Opportunity:**\nMedium-sized organizations often lack resources to manage human capital effectively. Paylocity's platform, including their core payroll product Paylocity Web Pay, is developed to meet this need by providing comprehensive HCM solutions. They anticipate growth in their client base and plan to extend their product offerings through continued research and development investment.\n\n**Growth Strategy:**\nPaylocity aims to expand its market share through direct sales force and improved marketing strategies, targeting new and existing geographic territories. They also focus on maintaining high-quality services to retain clients and attract new ones.\n\n**Investments for Growth:**\nThe company is investing in personnel, product enhancements, and infrastructure improvements to support growth. They acknowledge that some investments might occur before realizing direct benefits, affecting resource allocation effectiveness and increasing costs in the short term.\n\n**Impact of Economic Conditions:**\nPaylocity notes that economic downturns could delay sales, pressure for discounts, or affect the renewal of revenue agreements.\n\n**Financial Performance:**\nKey financial metrics reviewed by the company include recurring revenue growth, client count growth, annual revenue retention rate, and amounts related to adjusted gross profit, adjusted recurring gross profit, and adjusted EBITDA. \n\n**Revenue Growth:**\nAn impressive growth in recurring revenue is highlighted, with a 41% increase from fiscal 2014 to 2015, and a 53% increase from fiscal 2015 to 2016. This growth was largely influenced by the launch of the Affordable Care Act compliance solution.\n\n**Client Increase:**\nThe client count increased significantly, indicating a promising market expansion.\n\n**Financial Sustainability:**\nThe company demonstrates strong annual revenue retention, indicating satisfaction and quality of product offerings.\n\n**Profitability Metrics:**\nSeveral non-GAAP financial metrics such as adjusted EBITDA are used to evaluate profitability and operational performance.\n\n**Revenue Sources and Recognition:**\nMost revenue comes from recurring fees from software solutions and implementation service fees, recognized as services are provided.\n\n**Capital and Operating Expenditures:**\nThe company continues to invest in expanding its offerings and infrastructure, affecting liquidity and financial planning.\n\n**Subsidiary Information:**\nPaylocity Corporations is the primary operating subsidiary, conducting business.\n\n**Risks and Uncertainties:**\nThe report includes a detailed discussion about the risks and uncertainties associated with the company\u2019s operations and strategies.\n\n**Accounting Policies:**\nCritical accounting policies involving revenue recognition, treatment of property and equipment, capitalized internal-use software costs, goodwill, intangible assets, income taxes, and stock-based compensation are explained in detail.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources:**\nThe company believes existing cash and cash flows from operations will sustain working capital, capital expenses, and other investment requirements for at least 12 months.\n\n**New Accounting Pronouncements:**\nRecent FASB updates and their impact on accounting for revenues, leases, stock compensation, and credit losses are addressed with the disclosure of how the company plans to adopt these standards.\n\nThis summary captures the main points of the report, but lacks the detail and specific financial figures mentioned in the original text. It's important to note that this summary should be complemented with the full MD&A for comprehensive understanding."}
