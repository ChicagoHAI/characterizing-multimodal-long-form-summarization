Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with ITEM 8. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u201d. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, which relate to future events or the future performance or financial condition of Owl Rock Technology Finance Corp. and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\u201d This discussion also should be read in conjunction with the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements\u201d set forth on page 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Actual results could differ materially from those implied or expressed in any forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nOwl Rock Technology Finance Corp. (the Company\u201d, we\u201d, us\u201d or our\u201d) is a Maryland corporation formed on July 12, 2018. We were formed primarily to originate and make debt and equity investments in technology-related companies based primarily in the United States. We intend to originate and invest in senior secured or unsecured loans, subordinated loans or mezzanine loans, and equity-related securities including common equity, warrants, preferred stock and similar forms of senior equity, which may or may not be convertible into a portfolio company's common equity. Our investment objective is to maximize total return by generating current income from our debt investments and other income producing securities, and capital appreciation from our equity and equity-linked investments.\nWe are managed by Owl Rock Technology Advisors LLC ( the Adviser\u201d or our Adviser\u201d). The Adviser is registered with the SEC as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Subject to the overall supervision of our board of directors (the Board\u201d), the Adviser manages our day-to-day operations, and provides investment advisory and management services to us. The Adviser or its affiliates may engage in certain origination activities and receive attendant arrangement, structuring or similar fees. The Adviser is responsible for managing our business and activities, including sourcing investment opportunities, conducting research, performing diligence on potential investments, structuring our investments, and monitoring our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis through a team of investment professionals. The Board consists of seven directors, four of whom are independent.\nWe conduct private offerings (each, a Private Offering\u201d) of our common shares to accredited investors in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. At the closing of each Private Offering, each investor makes a capital commitment (a Capital Commitment\u201d) to purchase shares of our common stock pursuant to a subscription agreement entered into with us. Until the earlier of an Exchange Listing (as defined below) and the end of the Commitment Period (as defined below), investors are required to fund drawdowns to purchase shares of our common stock up to the amount of their respective Capital Commitment on an as-needed basis each time we deliver a drawdown notice to our investors. The initial closing of the Private Offering occurred on August 10, 2018 (the Initial Closing\u201d). As of December 31, 2018, we had $1.8 billion in total Capital Commitments from investors, of which $65.0 million is from entities affiliated with or related to our Adviser. Prior to the listing of our common stock on a national securities exchange (an Exchange Listing\u201d), the Adviser may, in its sole discretion, permit one or more additional closings ( Subsequent Closings\u201d) as additional Capital Commitments are obtained (the conclusion of all Subsequent Closings, if any, the Final Closing\u201d). The Commitment Period\u201d will continue until the earlier of the (i) five year anniversary of the Final Closing and (ii) the seven year anniversary of the Initial Closing. If we have not consummated a listing of our common shares on a national securities exchange by the end of the Commitment Period, subject to extension for two additional one-year periods, in the sole discretion of the Board, the Board (subject to any necessary shareholder approvals and applicable requirements of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act\u201d)) will use its commercially reasonable efforts to wind down and/or liquidate and dissolve the Company in an orderly manner.\nPlacement activities will be conducted by our officers and the Adviser. In addition, we may enter into agreements with placement agents or broker-dealers to solicit Capital Commitments. For example, the Company and the Adviser entered into a dealer manager agreement with Owl Rock Capital Securities LLC ( Owl Rock Securities\u201d) pursuant to which Owl Rock Securities and certain participating broker-dealers will solicit Capital Commitments and the Company entered into a placement agent agreement with Owl Rock Securities pursuant to which employees of Owl Rock Securities may conduct placement activities. Owl Rock Securities, an affiliate of Owl Rock, is registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC and is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. In addition, the Company, the Adviser and third party placement agents may enter into placement agreements from time to time, pursuant to which such placement agents will solicit Capital Commitments. Fees paid pursuant to these agreements will be paid by our Adviser.\nOwl Rock Capital Advisors LLC ( ORCA\u201d), an affiliate of the Adviser, serves as investment adviser to Owl Rock Capital Corporation and Owl Rock Capital Corporation II, both of which were formed under the laws of the State of Maryland and, like us, have elected to be treated as business development companies ( BDC\u201d) under the 1940 Act. Owl Rock Private Fund Advisors LLC ( ORPFA\u201d), an affiliate of the Adviser, services as investment adviser to Owl Rock First Lien Master Fund, L.P. The Adviser is under common control with ORCA and ORPFA, which are also investment advisers and indirect subsidiaries of Owl Rock Capital Partners. The Adviser, ORCA, ORPFA and Owl Rock Capital Partners are referred to, collectively, as Owl Rock.\u201d\nWe may be prohibited under the 1940 Act from participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, the prior approval of the SEC. We intend to rely on exemptive\nrelief, that has been granted by the SEC to Owl Rock Capital Advisors LLC and certain of its affiliates, to permit us to co-invest with other funds managed by the Adviser or certain of its affiliates, including Owl Rock Capital Corporation and Owl Rock Capital Corporation II, in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. Pursuant to such exemptive relief, we generally are permitted to co-invest with certain of our affiliates if a required majority\u201d (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our independent directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the transactions, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our shareholders and do not involve overreaching by us or our shareholders on the part of any person concerned, (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our shareholders and is consistent with our investment objective and strategies, and (3) the investment by our affiliates would not disadvantage us, and our participation would not be on a basis different from or less advantageous than that on which our affiliates are investing. Owl Rock's investment allocation policy seeks to ensure equitable allocation of investment opportunities between us, Owl Rock Capital Corporation, Owl Rock Capital Corporation II, and/or other funds managed by our Adviser or its affiliates. As a result of the exemptive relief, there could be significant overlap in our investment portfolio and the investment portfolio of Owl Rock Capital Corporation, Owl Rock Capital Corporation II and/or other funds established by the Adviser or its affiliates that could avail themselves of the exemptive relief.\nOn September 24, 2018, we formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, OR Tech Lending LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, which is intended to hold a California finance lenders license. OR Tech Lending LLC is intended to originate loans to borrowers headquartered in California.\nWe have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and intend to elect to be treated as a regulated investment company ( RIC\u201d) for tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code\u201d). As a result, we are required to comply with various statutory and regulatory requirements, such as:\nTable 154: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the requirement to invest at least 70% of our assets in qualifying assets\u201d, as such term is defined in the 1940 Act;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 155: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> source of income limitations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 156: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> asset diversification requirements; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 157: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the requirement to distribute (or be treated as distributing) in each taxable year at least 90% of our investment company taxable income and tax-exempt interest for that taxable year.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition, we will not invest more than 20% of our total assets in companies whose principal place of business is outside the United States, although we do not generally intend to invest in companies whose principal place of business is in an emerging market and we have adopted a policy to invest, under normal circumstances at least 80% of the value of our total assets in technology-related\u201d business (as defined below).\nOur Investment Framework\nWe are a Maryland corporation organized primarily to originate and make debt and equity investments in technology-related companies based primarily in the United States. We originate and invest in senior secured or unsecured loans, subordinated loans or mezzanine loans, and equity-related securities including common equity, warrants, preferred stock and similar forms of senior equity, which may or may not be convertible into a portfolio company's common equity. Our investment objective is to maximize total return by generating current income from debt investments and other income producing securities, and capital appreciation from our equity and equity-linked investments. Since our Adviser's affiliates began investment activities in April 2016 through December 31, 2018, our Adviser or its affiliates have originated $11.1 billion aggregate principal amount of investments across multiple industries, of which $9.8 billion of aggregate principal amount of investments prior to any subsequent exits or repayments, was retained by either us or a corporation or fund advised by our Adviser or its affiliates.\nWe intend to invest in a broad range of established and high growth technology and life sciences-related companies that are capitalizing on the large and growing demand for technology products and services. These companies use technology extensively to improve their business processes, applications and opportunities or seek to grow through technological developments and innovations. These companies operate in technology-related industries or sectors which include, but are not limited to, information technology, application or infrastructure software, financial services, data and analytics, security, cloud computing, communications, life sciences, healthcare, media, consumer electronics, semi-conductor, internet commerce and advertising, environmental, aerospace and defense industries and sectors. Within each industry or sector, we intend to invest in companies that are developing or offering goods and services to businesses and consumers which utilize scientific knowledge, including techniques, skills, methods, devices and processes, to solve problems. We refer to all of these companies as technology-related\u201d companies and intend, under normal circumstances, to invest at least 80% of the value of our total assets in such businesses.\nWe expect that generally our portfolio composition will be majority debt or income producing securities, which may include covenant-lite\u201d loans (as defined below), with a lesser allocation to equity or equity-linked opportunities. In addition, we may invest a portion of our portfolio in opportunistic investments, which will not be our primary focus, but will be intended to enhance returns to\nour Shareholders. These investments may include high-yield bonds and broadly-syndicated loans. In addition, we generally do not intend to invest more than 20% of our total assets in companies whose principal place of business is outside the United States, although we do not generally intend to invest in companies whose principal place of business is in an emerging market. Our portfolio composition may fluctuate from time to time based on market conditions and interest rates.\nCovenants are contractual restrictions that lenders place on companies to limit the corporate actions a company may pursue. Generally, the loans in which we expect to invest will have financial maintenance covenants, which are used to proactively address materially adverse changes in a portfolio company's financial performance. However, to a lesser extent, we may invest in covenant-lite\u201d loans. We use the term covenant-lite\u201d to refer generally to loans that do not have a complete set of financial maintenance covenants. Generally, covenant-lite\u201d loans provide borrower companies more freedom to negatively impact lenders because their covenants are incurrence-based, which means they are only tested and can only be breached following an affirmative action of the borrower, rather than by a deterioration in the borrower's financial condition. Accordingly, to the extent we invest in covenant-lite\u201d loans, we may have fewer rights against a borrower and may have a greater risk of loss on such investments as compared to investments in or exposure to loans with financial maintenance covenants.\nThe companies in which we invest use our capital to support their growth, acquisitions, market or product expansion, refinancings and/or recapitalizations. The debt in which we invest typically is not rated by any rating agency, but if these instruments were rated, they would likely receive a rating of below investment grade (that is, below BBB- or Baa3), which is often referred to as high yield\u201d or junk\u201d.\nKey Components of Our Results of Operations\nInvestments\nWe focus primarily on the direct origination of loans to middle market, technology-related companies domiciled in the United States.\nOur level of investment activity (both the number of investments and the size of each investment) can and will vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make.\nIn addition, as part of our risk strategy on investments, we may reduce the levels of certain investments through partial sales or syndication to additional lenders.\nRevenues\nWe generate revenues primarily in the form of interest income from the investments we hold. In addition, we may generate income from dividends on either direct equity investments or equity interests obtained in connection with originating loans, such as options, warrants or conversion rights. Our debt investments typically have a term of three to ten years. As of December 31, 2018, 89.0% of our debt investments based on fair value bear interest at a floating rate, subject to interest rate floors, in certain cases. Interest on our debt investments is generally payable either monthly or quarterly.\nOur investment portfolio consists primarily of floating rate loans. Macro trends in base interest rates like London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) may affect our net investment income over the long term. However, because we generally intend to originate loans to a small number of portfolio companies each quarter, and those investments may vary in size, our results in any given period, including the interest rate on investments that may be sold or repaid in a period compared to the interest rate of new investments made during that period, may be idiosyncratic, and reflect the characteristics of the particular portfolio companies that we invested in or exited during the period and not necessarily any trends in our business or macro trends.\nLoan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income using the effective yield method for term instruments and the straight-line method for revolving or delayed draw instruments. Repayments of our debt investments can reduce interest income from period to period. The frequency or volume of these repayments may fluctuate significantly. We record prepayment premiums on loans as interest income. We may also generate revenue in the form of commitment, loan origination, structuring, or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance to our portfolio companies and possibly consulting fees. Certain of these fees may be capitalized and amortized as additional interest income over the life of the related loan.\nDividend income on equity investments is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded companies.\nOur portfolio activity will also reflect the proceeds from sales of investments. We will recognize realized gains or losses on investments based on the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the amortized cost basis of the investment without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We record current period changes in fair value of investments that are measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized gains (losses) on investments in the consolidated statement of operations.\nExpenses\nOur primary operating expenses include the payment of the management fee, the incentive fee, and expenses reimbursable under the Administration Agreement and Investment Advisory Agreement. The management fee and incentive fee compensate our Adviser for work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, closing, monitoring and realizing our investments.\nExcept as specifically provided below, we anticipate that all investment professionals and staff of the Adviser, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory and management services to us, and the base compensation, bonus and benefits, and the routine overhead expenses, of such personnel allocable to such services, will be provided and paid for by the Adviser. In addition, the Adviser shall be solely responsible for any placement or finder's\u201d fees payable to placement agents engaged by the Company or its affiliates in connection with the offering of securities by the Company. We will bear our allocable portion of the costs of the compensation, benefits and related administrative expenses (including travel expenses) of our officers who provide operational and administrative services hereunder, their respective staffs and other professionals who provide services to us (including, in each case, employees of the Adviser or an affiliate) who assist with the preparation, coordination, and administration of the foregoing or provide other back office\u201d or middle office\u201d financial or operational services to us. We shall reimburse the Adviser (or its affiliates) for an allocable portion of the compensation paid by the Adviser (or its affiliates) to such individuals (based on a percentage of time such individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to our business affairs and in acting on our behalf). We also will bear all other costs and expenses of our operations, administration and transactions, including, but not limited to (i) investment advisory fees, including Management Fees and Incentive Fees, to the Adviser, pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement; (ii) our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Adviser in performing its administrative obligations under the Investment Advisory Agreement and (iii) all other expenses of our operations and transactions including, without limitation, those relating to:\nTable 158: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the cost of our organization and any offerings;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 159: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the cost of calculating our net asset value, including the cost of any third-party valuation services;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 160: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the cost of effecting any sales and repurchases of the Common Stock and other securities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 161: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> fees and expenses payable under any dealer manager agreements, if any;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 162: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> debt service and other costs of borrowings or other financing arrangements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 163: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> costs of hedging;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 164: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> expenses, including travel expense, incurred by the Adviser, or members of the investment team, or payable to third parties, performing due diligence on prospective portfolio companies and, if necessary, enforcing our rights;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 165: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> escrow agent, transfer agent and custodial fees and expenses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 166: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 167: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> federal and state registration fees, any stock exchange listing fees and fees payable to rating agencies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 168: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> federal, state and local taxes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 169: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> independent directors' fees and expenses, including certain travel expenses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 170: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> costs of preparing financial statements and maintaining books and records and filing reports or other documents with the SEC (or other regulatory bodies) and other reporting and compliance costs, including registration fees, listing fees and licenses, and the compensation of professionals responsible for the preparation of the foregoing;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 171: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to our shareholders (including printing and mailing costs);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 172: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs of any shareholder or director meetings and the compensation of personnel responsible for the preparation of the foregoing and related matters;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 173: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> commissions and other compensation payable to brokers or dealers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 174: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> research and market data;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 175: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> fidelity bond, directors and officers errors and omissions liability insurance and other insurance premiums;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 176: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> direct costs and expenses of administration, including printing, mailing, long distance telephone and staff;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 177: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> fees and expenses associated with independent audits, outside legal and consulting costs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> costs of winding up;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 179: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> costs incurred in connection with the formation or maintenance of entities or vehicles to hold our assets for tax or other purposes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 180: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> extraordinary expenses (such as litigation or indemnification);

We generally will be permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to the common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, would at least be equal to 200% immediately after each such issuance. However, recent legislation has modified the 1940 Act by allowing a BDC to increase the maximum amount of leverage it may incur from an asset coverage ratio of 200% to an asset coverage ratio of 150%, if certain requirements are met. The reduced asset coverage requirement would permit a BDC to double the amount of leverage it can incur. For example, under a 150% asset coverage ratio the Company may borrow $2 for investment purposes of every $1 of investor equity whereas under a 200% asset coverage ratio the Company may only borrow $1 for investment purposes for every $1 of investor equity. On August 7, 2018, our Adviser, as our sole initial shareholder, has approved a proposal that allows us to reduce our asset coverage ratio to 150% and in connection with their subscription agreements, our investors are required to acknowledge our ability to operate with an asset coverage ratio that may be as low as 150%.\nIn any period, our interest expense will depend largely on the extent of our borrowing and we expect interest expense will increase as we increase our leverage over time subject to the limits of the 1940 Act. In addition, we may dedicate assets to financing facilities.\nMarket Trends\nWe believe the technology investment lending environment provides opportunities for us to meet our goal of making investments that generate an attractive total return based on a combination of the following factors:\nLimited Availability of Capital for Technology Companies. We believe that technology companies have limited access to capital, driven by a reduction in activity from commercial and investment banks, and a lack of dedicated pools of capital focused on\ntechnology companies. Traditional lenders, such as commercial and investment banks, generally do not have flexible product offerings that meet the needs of technology-related companies. In recent years, many commercial and investment banks have focused their efforts and resources on lending to large corporate clients and managing capital markets transactions rather than lending to technology-related companies. In addition, these lenders may be constrained in their ability to underwrite and hold loans and high yield securities, as well as their ability to provide equity financing, as they seek to meet existing and future regulatory capital requirements. We also believe that there is a lack of scaled market participants that are willing to provide and hold meaningful amounts of a customized financing solution for technology companies. As a result, we believe our focus on technology-related companies and our ability to invest across the capital structure, coupled with a limited supply of capital providers, presents an attractive opportunity to invest in technology companies.\nCapital Markets Have Been Unable to Fill the Void Left by Banks. While underwritten bond and syndicated loan markets have been robust in recent years, many technology companies are less able to access these markets for reasons including the following:\nHigh Yield Market - Many technology companies generally are not issuing debt in an amount large enough to be an attractively sized bond. High yield bonds are generally purchased by institutional investors who, among other things, are highly focused on the liquidity characteristics of the bond being issued. For example, mutual funds and exchange traded funds ( ETFs\u201d) are significant buyers of underwritten bonds. However, mutual funds and ETFs generally require the ability to liquidate their investments quickly in order to fund investor redemptions and/or comply with regulatory requirements. Accordingly, the existence of an active secondary market for bonds is an important consideration in these entities' initial investment decision. Because there is typically little or no active secondary market for the debt of U.S. middle market companies, mutual funds and ETFs generally do not provide debt capital to technology companies. We believe this is likely to be a persistent problem and creates an advantage for those like us who have a more stable capital base and have the ability to invest in illiquid assets.\nSyndicated Loan Market - Loan issue size and liquidity are key drivers of institutional appetite and, correspondingly, underwriters' willingness to underwrite the loans. Loans arranged through a bank are done either on a best efforts\u201d basis or are underwritten with terms plus provisions that permit the underwriters to change certain terms, including pricing, structure, yield and\ntenor, otherwise known as flex\u201d, to successfully syndicate the loan, in the event the terms initially marketed are insufficiently attractive to investors. Loans provided by companies such as ours provide certainty to issuers in that we can commit to a given amount of debt on specific terms, at stated coupons and with agreed upon fees. As we are the ultimate holder of the loans, we do not require market flex\u201d or other arrangements that banks may require when acting on an agency basis.\nRobust Demand for Debt Capital. According to S&P Capital IQ, there was approximately $1.2 trillion of mergers and acquisitions activity in the technology and software industries from 2013 through 2017. We believe technology companies will continue to require access to capital to refinance existing debt, support growth and finance acquisitions. In addition, we believe the large amount of uninvested capital held by funds of private equity firms, estimated by Preqin Ltd., an alternative assets industry data and research company, to be $1.2 trillion as of December 2018, coupled with a growing focus on technology investing by private equity sponsors, will continue to drive deal activity. We expect that technology companies, private equity sponsors, venture capital firms, and entrepreneurs will continue to seek partners to provide flexible financing for their businesses with debt and equity investments provided by companies such as us.\nTechnology Spend is Large and Increasing. According to Gartner, a research and advisory company, global technology spend was $3.5 trillion in 2017 and is expected to grow to more than $4.0 trillion by 2021. We believe global demand for technology products and services will continue to grow rapidly, and that that growth will stimulate demand for capital from technology companies.\nAttractive Investment Dynamics. An imbalance between the supply of, and demand for, capital creates attractive pricing dynamics. With respect to the debt investments in technology companies, we believe the directly negotiated nature of such financings generally provides more favorable terms to the lender, including stronger covenant and reporting packages, better call protection, and lender protective change of control provisions. Further, we believe that historical default rates for technology and software companies have been lower, and recovery rates have been higher, as compared to the broader leveraged finance market, leading to lower cumulative losses. With respect to equity and equity-linked investments, we will seek to structure these investments with meaningful shareholder protections, including, but not limited to, anti-dilution, anti-layering, and liquidation preferences, which we believe will create the potential for meaningful risk-adjusted long-term capital gains in connection with the future liquidity events of these technology companies.\nCompelling Business Models. We believe that the products and services that technology companies provide often have high switching costs and are fundamental to the operations and success of their customers. As a result, technology companies have attributes that make them compelling investments, including strong customer retention rates, and highly recurring and predictable revenue. Further, technology companies are typically highly capital efficient, with limited capital expenditures and high free cash flow conversion.\nAttractive Opportunities in Investments in Technology Companies. We invest in the debt and equity of technology companies. We believe that opportunities in the debt of technology companies are significant because of the floating rate structure of most senior secured debt issuances and because of the strong defensive characteristics of these types of investments. Given the current low interest rate environment, we believe that debt issues with floating interest rates offer a superior return profile as compared with fixed-rate investments, since floating rate structures are generally less susceptible to declines in value experienced by fixed-rate securities in a rising interest rate environment. Senior secured debt also provides strong defensive characteristics. Senior secured debt has priority in payment among an issuer's security holders whereby holders are due to receive payment before junior creditors and equity holders. Further, these investments are generally secured by the issuer's assets, which may provide protection in the event of a default.\nWe believe that opportunities in the equity of technology companies are significant because of the potential to generate meaningful capital appreciation by participating in the growth in the portfolio company and the demand for its products and services. Moreover, we believe that the high-growth profile of a technology company will generally make it a more attractive candidate for a liquidity event than a company in a non-high growth industry.\nPortfolio and Investment Activity\nAs of December 31, 2018, based on fair value, our portfolio consisted of 81.6% first lien senior secured debt investments, 7.4% second lien senior secured debt investments and 11.0% unsecured debt investments.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our weighted average total yield of the portfolio at fair value and amortized cost was 8.0% and 8.0%, respectively, and our weighted average yield of debt and income producing securities at fair value and amortized cost was 8.0% and 8.0%, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2018 we had investments in six portfolio companies with an aggregate fair value of $262.8 million.\nOur investment activity for the period ended December 31, 2018 is presented below (information presented herein is at par value unless otherwise indicated).\nTable 182: <table></table>\nTable 183: <table> <tr> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Period from July 12, 2018 (Inception) to December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td>

rather, relates to a portion of our investment portfolio and is calculated before the payment of all of our and our subsidiaries' fees and expenses. The weighted average yield was computed using the effective interest rates as of each respective date, including accretion of original issue discount and loan origination fees, but excluding investments on non-accrual status, if any. There can be no assurance that the weighted average yield will remain at its current level.\nOur Adviser monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. It monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if they are meeting their respective business plans and to assess the appropriate course of action with respect to each portfolio company. Our Adviser has several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which may include the following:\nTable 190: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> assessment of success of the portfolio company in adhering to its business plan and compliance with covenants;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 191: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> periodic and regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor, to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 192: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> comparisons to other companies in the portfolio company's industry; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 193: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> review of monthly or quarterly financial statements and financial projections for portfolio companies.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs part of the monitoring process, our Adviser employs an investment rating system to categorize our investments. In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, our Adviser rates the credit risk of all investments on a scale of 1 to 5. This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio investment relative to our initial cost basis in respect of such portfolio investment (i.e., at the time of origination or acquisition), although it may also take into account the performance of the portfolio company's business, the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors. The rating system is as follows:\nTable 194: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment Rating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Description\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Investments with a rating of 1 involve the least amount of risk to our initial cost basis.

For investments rated 3, 4 or 5, our Adviser enhances its level of scrutiny over the monitoring of such portfolio company.\nThe following table shows the composition of our portfolio on the 1 to 5 rating scale as of December 31, 2018:\nTable 196: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment Rating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Investments\nat Fair Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage of\nTotal Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 262,833\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 262,833\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table shows the amortized cost of our performing and non-accrual debt investments as of December 31, 2018:\nTable 197: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amortized Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Performing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 263,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-accrual\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 263,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoans are generally placed on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Accrued interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management's judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid current and, in management's judgment, are likely to remain current. Management may make exceptions to this treatment and determine to not place a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table represents the operating results for the period ended December 31, 2018:\nTable 198: <table> <tr> <td> ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Period from July 12, 2018 (Inception) to December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Investment Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Investment Income (Loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net change in unrealized gain (loss) on investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets Resulting from Operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations can vary from period to period as a result of various factors, including the level of new investment commitments, expenses, the recognition of realized gains and losses and changes in unrealized appreciation and depreciation on the investment portfolio. Additionally, we were initially capitalized on August 7, 2018 and commenced investing activities in September 2018. As a result, comparisons may not be meaningful.\nInvestment Income\nInvestment income for the period ended December 31, 2018 were as follows:\nTable 199: <table> <tr> <td> ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Period from July 12, 2018 (Inception) to December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income from investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total investment income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe generate revenues primarily in the form of interest income from the investments we hold.

In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Administration Agreement, the Adviser may delegate its obligations under the Administration Agreement to an affiliate or to a third party and we reimburse the Adviser for any services performed for us by such affiliate or third party.\nIncome Taxes, Including Excise Taxes\nWe intend to elect to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, and we intend to operate in a manner so as to continue to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify for tax treatment as a RIC, we must, among other things, distribute to our shareholders in each taxable year generally at least 90% of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, and net tax-exempt income for that taxable year. To maintain our tax treatment as a RIC, we, among other things, intend to make the requisite distributions to our shareholders, which generally relieves us from corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes.\nDepending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we can be expected to carry forward taxable income (including net capital gains, if any) in excess of current year dividend distributions from the current tax year into the next tax year and pay a nondeductible 4% U.S. federal excise tax on such taxable income, as required. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions from such income, we will accrue excise tax on estimated excess taxable income.\nFor the period ended December 31, 2018 we did not accrue U.S. federal excise tax.\nNet Change in Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Investments\nWe fair value our portfolio investments quarterly and any changes in fair value are recorded as unrealized gains or losses. During the period ended December 31, 2018, net unrealized gains (losses) on our investment portfolio were comprised of the following:\nTable 201: <table> <tr> <td> ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Period from July 12, 2018 (Inception) to December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net change in unrealized gain (loss) on investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net change in unrealized gain (loss) on investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOur liquidity and capital resources are generated primarily from the proceeds of capital drawdowns of our privately placed Capital Commitments, cash flows from interest, dividends and fees earned from our investments and principal repayments, and our credit facilities. The primary uses of our cash are (i) investments in portfolio companies and other investments and to comply with certain portfolio diversification requirements, (ii) the cost of operations (including paying our Adviser) and (iii) cash distributions to the holders of our shares.\nWe may from time to time enter into additional debt facilities, increase the size of our existing credit facilities or issue additional debt securities. Any such incurrence or issuance would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. In accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to incur borrowings, issue debt securities or issue preferred stock, if immediately after the borrowing or issuance, the ratio of total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness) to total indebtedness plus preferred stock, is at least 150%. As of December 31, 2018, our asset coverage ratio was 195%. We seek to carefully consider our unfunded commitments for the purpose of planning our ongoing financial leverage. Further, we maintain sufficient borrowing capacity within the 150% asset coverage limitation to cover any outstanding unfunded commitments we are required to fund.\nCash as of December 31, 2018, taken together with our uncalled Capital Commitments of $1.5 billion and available debt capacity of $50.0 million, is expected to be sufficient for our investing activities and to conduct our operations in the near term.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $323.0 million in cash. During the period ended December 31, 2018, we used $263.5 million in cash for operating activities, primarily as a result of funding portfolio investments of $262.8 million, partially offset by other operating activity of $0.7 million. Lastly, cash provided by financing activities was $586.6 million during the period, which was the result of proceeds from the issuance of shares, net of offering costs paid, of $289.0 million and proceeds from net borrowing on our credit facilities, net of debt issuance costs, of $297.6 million.\nEquity\nSubscriptions and Drawdowns\nIn connection with our formation, we have the authority to issue 500,000,000 common shares at $0.01 per share par value.\nOn August 7, 2018, we issued 100 common shares for $1,500 to Owl Rock Technology Advisors LLC, which subsequently became our Adviser on August 10, 2018.\nWe have entered into subscription agreements (the Subscription Agreements\u201d) with investors providing for the private placement of our common shares. Under the terms of the Subscription Agreements, investors are required to fund drawdowns to purchase our common shares up to the amount of their respective Capital Commitment on an as-needed basis each time we deliver a capital call notice to its investors.\nDuring the period ended December 31, 2018, we delivered the following capital call notices to investors:\nTable 202: <table> <tr> <td> Capital Drawdown Notice Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Common Share Issuance Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Number of Common Shares Issued\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Aggregate Offering Price\n($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> August 20, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> August 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,666,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 40.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> September 13, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> September 26, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,168,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 120.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> November 26, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 7, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,904,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 129.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,738,951\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 289.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDistributions\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we did not declare any distributions on shares of our common stock. On February 27, 2019, our Board declared a distribution of 90% of estimated first quarter taxable income and net capital gains, if any, for shareholders of record on March 31, 2019, payable on or before May 15, 2019.\nDividend Reinvestment\nWith respect to distributions, we adopted an opt out\u201d dividend reinvestment plan for common shareholders. As a result, in the event of a declared distribution, each shareholder that has not opted out\u201d of the dividend reinvestment plan will have their dividends or distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock rather than receiving cash distributions. Shareholders who receive distributions in the form of shares of common stock will be subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash distributions.\nDebt\nAggregate Borrowings\nDebt obligations consisted of the following as of December 31, 2018:\nTable 203: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Aggregate Principal Committed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Outstanding Principal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount Available(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net Carrying Value(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subscription Credit Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 350,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 50,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 297,555\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 350,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 50,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 297,555\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n________________\nTable 204: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> The amount available reflects any limitations related to each credit facility's borrowing base.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 205: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> The carrying value of our Subscription Credit Facility is presented net of debt issuance costs of $2.4 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the period ended December 31, 2018, the components of interest expense were as follows:\nTable 206: <table> <tr> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Period from July 12, 2018 (Inception) to December 31, 2018(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of debt issuance costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Interest Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.91\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average daily borrowings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n________________\nTable 207: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Average reflects the period from November 19, 2018, the date of the agreement, through December 31, 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSubscription Credit Facility\nOn November 19, 2018 (the Closing Date\u201d), Owl Rock Technology Finance Corp. (the Company\u201d) entered into a revolving credit facility (the Subscription Credit Facility\u201d) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ( Wells Fargo\u201d) as administrative agent (the Administrative Agent\u201d), and Wells Fargo, PNC Bank, National Association ( PNC\u201d), and State Street Bank and Trust\nCompany ( State Street\u201d), as lenders, with a maximum principal amount of the Subscription Credit Facility of $350 million, subject to availability under the borrowing base, which is based on unused capital commitments.\nOn February 25, 2019, the maximum principal amount of the Subscription Credit Facility was increased to $450 million, subject to availability under the borrowing base, which is based on unused capital commitments. The maximum principal amount of the Subscription Credit Facility may be further increased upon request of the Company up to $700 million, subject to customary conditions, and the Subscription Credit Facility also includes a provision permitting the Company to further increase the size of the Subscription Credit Facility under certain circumstances up to a maximum principal amount not to exceed $1 billion, if the existing or new lenders agree to commit to such further increase. Borrowings under the Subscription Credit Facility bear interest, at the Company's election at the time of drawdown, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of LIBOR rate loans, an adjusted LIBOR rate for the applicable interest period plus 1.50% or (ii) in the case of reference rate loans, the greatest of (A) a prime rate plus 0.50%, (B) the federal funds rate plus 1.00%, and (C) one-month LIBOR plus 1.50%. Loans may be converted from one rate to another at any time at the Company's election, subject to certain conditions. The Company also will pay an unused commitment fee of 0.25% per annum on the unused commitments.\nThe Subscription Credit Facility will mature upon the earliest of: (i) the date three (3) years from the Closing Date (the Stated Maturity Date\u201d); (ii) the date upon which the Administrative Agent declares the obligations under the Subscription Credit Facility due and payable after the occurrence of an event of default; (iii) forty-five (45) days prior to the scheduled termination of the commitment period under the Company's subscription agreements; (iv) forty-five (45) days prior to the date of any listing of the Company's common stock on a national securities exchange; (v) the termination of the commitment period under the Company's subscription agreements (if earlier than the scheduled date); and (vi) the date the Company terminates the commitments pursuant to the Subscription Credit Facility. At the Company's option, the Stated Maturity Date may be extended by up to 364 days, subject to satisfaction of customary conditions.\nThe Subscription Credit Facility is secured by a perfected first priority security interest in the Company's right, title, and interest in and to the capital commitments of the Company's private investors, including the Company's right to make capital calls, receive and apply capital contributions, enforce remedies and claims related thereto together with capital call proceeds and related rights, and a pledge of the collateral account into which capital call proceeds are deposited.\nThe Subscription Credit Facility contains customary covenants, including certain limitations on the incurrence by us of additional indebtedness and on our ability to make distributions to our shareholders, or redeem, repurchase or retire shares of stock, upon the occurrence of certain events, and customary events of default (with customary cure and notice provisions).\nTransfers of interests in the Company by investors must comply with certain sections of the Subscription Credit Facility and we shall notify the Administrative Agent before such transfers take place. Such transfers may trigger mandatory prepayment obligations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nPortfolio Company Commitments\nFrom time to time, we may enter into commitments to fund investments. As of December 31, 2018, we had the following outstanding commitments to fund investments in current portfolio companies:\nTable 208: <table> <tr> <td> Portfolio Company\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Investment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cheese Acquisition, LLC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> First lien senior secured delayed draw term loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 31,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cheese Acquisition, LLC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> First lien senior secured revolving loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,545\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gerson Lehrman Group, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> First lien senior secured revolving loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lightning Midco, LLC (dba Vector Solutions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> First lien senior secured delayed draw term loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lightning Midco, LLC (dba Vector Solutions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> First lien senior secured revolving loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Unfunded Portfolio Company Commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 65,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company maintains sufficient capacity to cover outstanding unfunded portfolio company commitments that the Company may be required to fund.\nInvestor Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $1.8 billion in total Capital Commitments from our investors ($1.5 billion undrawn), of which $65.0 million is from an affiliate of our Adviser ($58.4 million undrawn). These undrawn Capital Commitments will no longer remain in effect following the completion of an initial public offering of our common stock.\nOther Commitments and Contingencies\nFrom time to time, we may become a party to certain legal proceedings incidental to the normal course of its business. At December 31, 2018, management was not aware of any pending or threatened litigation.\nRelated-Party Transactions\nWe have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following:\nTable 209: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the Investment Advisory Agreement;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 210: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the Administration Agreement;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 211: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the Dealer Manager Agreement;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 212: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the Placement Agent Agreement; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 213: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the License Agreement.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to the aforementioned agreements, we intend to rely on exemptive relief that has been granted to ORCA and certain of its affiliates to permit us to co-invest with other funds managed by our Adviser or certain of its affiliates including Owl Rock Capital Corporation and Owl Rock Capital Corporation II in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. See ITEM 1. - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 3. Agreements and Related Party Transactions\u201d for further details.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. Our critical accounting policies should be read in connection with our risk factors as described in ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\u201d\nInvestments at Fair Value\nInvestment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds received (excluding prepayment fees, if any) and the amortized cost basis of the investment using the specific identification method without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized, and include investments charged off during the period, net of recoveries. The net change in unrealized gains or losses primarily reflects the change in investment values, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains or losses with respect to investments realized during the period.\nInvestments for which market quotations are readily available are typically valued at the bid price of those market quotations. To validate market quotations, we utilize a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and number of the quotations. Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available, as is the case for substantially all of our investments, are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board, based on, among other things, the input of the Adviser, our audit committee and independent third-party valuation firm(s) engaged at the direction of the Board.\nAs part of the valuation process, the Board takes into account relevant factors in determining the fair value of our investments, including: the estimated enterprise value of a portfolio company (i.e., the total fair value of the portfolio company's debt and equity), the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments based on its earnings and cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, a comparison of the portfolio company's securities to any similar publicly traded securities, and overall changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets that may affect the price at which similar investments may be made in the future. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, the Board considers whether the pricing indicated by the external event corroborates its valuation.\nThe Board undertakes a multi-step valuation process, which includes, among other procedures, the following:\nTable 214: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> With respect to investments for which market quotations are readily available, those investments will typically be valued at the bid price of those market quotations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 215: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> With respect to investment for which market quotations are not readily available, the valuation process begins with the independent valuation firm(s) providing a preliminary valuation of each investment to the Adviser's valuation committee;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 216: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Preliminary valuation conclusions are documented and discussed with the Adviser's valuation committee. Agreed upon valuation recommendations are presented to the Audit Committee;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 217: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The Audit Committee reviews the valuations recommendations and recommends values for each investment to the Board; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 218: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The Board reviews the recommended valuations and determines the fair value of each investment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe conduct this valuation process on a quarterly basis.\nWe apply Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 820, Fair Value Measurements ( ASC 820\u201d), as amended, which establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP and required disclosures of fair value measurements. ASC 820 determines fair value to be the price that would be received for an investment in a current sale, which assumes an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market (which may be a hypothetical market) that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. In accordance with ASC 820, we consider its principal market to be the market that has the greatest volume and level of activity. ASC 820 specifies a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes and ranks the level of observability of inputs used in determination of fair value. In accordance with ASC 820, these levels are summarized below:\nTable 219: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Level 1 - Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 220: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Level 2 - Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 221: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Level 3 - Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTransfers between levels, if any, are recognized at the beginning of the quarter in which the transfer occurred. In addition to using the above inputs in investment valuations, we apply the valuation policy approved by our Board that is consistent with ASC 820. Consistent with the valuation policy, we evaluate the source of the inputs, including any markets in which our investments are trading (or any markets in which securities with similar attributes are trading), in determining fair value. When an investment is valued based on prices provided by reputable dealers or pricing services (that is, broker quotes), we subject those prices to various criteria in making the determination as to whether a particular investment would qualify for treatment as a Level 2 or Level 3 investment. For example, we, or the independent valuation firm(s), review pricing support provided by dealers or pricing services in order to determine if observable market information is being used, versus unobservable inputs.\nDue to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of such investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that may ultimately be realized. Further, such investments are generally less liquid than publicly traded securities and may be subject to contractual and other restrictions on resale. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, it could realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material.\nIn addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected herein.\nInterest and Dividend Income Recognition\nInterest income is recorded on the accrual basis and includes amortization of discounts or premiums. Discounts and premiums to par value on securities purchased are amortized into interest income over the contractual life of the respective security using the effective yield method. The amortized cost of investments represents the original cost adjusted for the amortization of discounts or premiums, if any. Upon prepayment of a loan or debt security, any prepayment premiums, unamortized upfront loan origination fees and unamortized discounts are recorded as interest income in the current period.\nLoans are generally placed on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Accrued interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management's judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual\nloans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid current and, in management's judgment, are likely to remain current. Management may make exceptions to this treatment and determine to not place a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.\nDividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly-traded portfolio companies.\nDistributions\nWe intend to elect to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and qualify annually thereafter, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. To obtain and maintain our tax treatment as a RIC, we must distribute (or be deemed to distribute) in each taxable year distribution for tax purposes equal to at least 90 percent of the sum of our:\nTable 222: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> investment company taxable income (which is generally our ordinary income plus the excess of realized short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid, for such taxable year; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 223: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> net tax-exempt interest income (which is the excess of our gross tax-exempt interest income over certain disallowed deductions) for such taxable year.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs a RIC, we (but not our shareholders) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal tax on investment company taxable income and net capital gains that we distribute to our shareholders.\nWe intend to distribute annually all or substantially all of such income. To the extent that we retain our net capital gains or any investment company taxable income, we generally will be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax. We can be expected to carry forward our net capital gains or any investment company taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions, and pay the U.S. federal excise tax as described below.\nAmounts not distributed on a timely basis in accordance with a calendar year distribution requirement are subject to a nondeductible 4% U.S. federal excise tax payable by us. We may be subject to a nondeductible 4% U.S. federal excise tax if we do not distribute (or are treated as distributing) during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of:\nTable 224: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> 98% of our net ordinary income excluding certain ordinary gains or losses for that calendar year;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 225: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> 98.2% of our capital gain net income, adjusted for certain ordinary gains and losses, recognized for the twelve-month period ending on October 31 of that calendar year; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 226: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> 100% of any income or gains recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhile we intend to distribute any income and capital gains in the manner necessary to minimize imposition of the 4% U.S. federal excise tax, sufficient amounts of our taxable income and capital gains may not be distributed and as a result, in such cases, the excise tax will be imposed. In such an event, we will be liable for this tax only on the amount by which we do not meet the foregoing distribution requirement.\nWe intend to pay quarterly distributions to our shareholders out of assets legally available for distribution. All distributions will be paid at the discretion of our Board and will depend on our earnings, financial condition, maintenance of our tax treatment as a RIC, compliance with applicable BDC regulations and such other factors as our Board may deem relevant from time to time.\nTo the extent our current taxable earnings for a year fall below the total amount of our distributions for that year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, the source of a distribution to our shareholders may be the original capital invested by the shareholder rather than our income or gains. Shareholders should read written disclosure carefully and should not assume that the source of any distribution is our ordinary income or gains.\nWe have adopted an opt out\u201d dividend reinvestment plan for our common shareholders. As a result, if we declare a cash dividend or other distribution, each shareholder that has not opted out\u201d of our dividend reinvestment plan will have their dividends or distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock rather than receiving cash distributions. Shareholders who receive distributions in the form of shares of common stock will be subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash distributions.\nIncome Taxes\nWe have elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We also intend to elect to be treated as a RIC under the Code beginning with its taxable period ending December 31, 2018. So long as we maintain our tax treatment as a RIC, we generally will not pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute at least annually to our shareholders as dividends. Instead, any tax liability related to income earned and distributed by us represents obligations of our investors and will not be reflected in our consolidated financial statements.\nTo qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. In addition, to qualify for RIC tax treatment, we must distribute to its shareholders, for each taxable year, at least 90% of our investment company taxable income\u201d for that year, which is generally our ordinary income plus the excess of our realized net short-term capital gains over our realized net long-term capital losses. In order for us not to be subject to U.S. federal excise taxes, we must distribute annually an amount at least equal to the sum of (i) 98% of our net ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for the calendar year, (ii) 98.2% of our capital gains in excess of capital losses for the one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year and (iii) any net ordinary income and capital gains in excess of capital losses for preceding years that were not distributed during such years. We, at our discretion, may carry forward taxable income in excess of calendar year dividends and pay a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on this income.\nWe do not currently qualify as a publicly offered regulated investment company,\u201d as defined in the Code. Accordingly, shareholders may be taxed as though they received a distribution of some of our expenses. A publicly offered regulated investment company\u201d is a RIC whose shares are either (i) continuously offered pursuant to a public offering, (ii) regularly traded on an established securities market, or (iii) held by at least 500 persons at all times during the taxable year. The Company cannot determine when it will qualify as a publicly offered RIC. If we do not qualify as a publicly offered RIC during the tax year, a non-corporate shareholder's allocable portion of our affected expenses, including a portion of its management fees, will be treated as an additional distribution to shareholders. A non-corporate shareholder's allocable portion of these expenses are treated as miscellaneous itemized deductions that are not currently deductible by such shareholders.\nWe evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing our consolidated financial statements to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not\u201d to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not\u201d threshold are reserved and recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. All penalties and interest associated with income taxes are included in income tax expense. Conclusions regarding tax positions are subject to review and may be adjusted at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, on-going analyses of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. There were no material uncertain tax positions through December 31, 2018.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with ITEM 8. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u201d. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, which relate to future events or the future performance or financial condition of Owl Rock Technology Finance Corp. and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\u201d This discussion also should be read in conjunction with the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements\u201d set forth on page 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Actual results could differ materially from those implied or expressed in any forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nOwl Rock Technology Finance Corp. (the Company\u201d, we\u201d, us\u201d or our\u201d) is a Maryland corporation formed on July 12, 2018. We were formed primarily to originate and make debt and equity investments in technology-related companies based primarily in the United States. We intend to originate and invest in senior secured or unsecured loans, subordinated loans or mezzanine loans, and equity-related securities including common equity, warrants, preferred stock and similar forms of senior equity, which may or may not be convertible into a portfolio company's common equity. Our investment objective is to maximize total return by generating current income from our debt investments and other income producing securities, and capital appreciation from our equity and equity-linked investments.\nWe are managed by Owl Rock Technology Advisors LLC ( the Adviser\u201d or our Adviser\u201d). The Adviser is registered with the SEC as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Subject to the overall supervision of our board of directors (the Board\u201d), the Adviser manages our day-to-day operations, and provides investment advisory and management services to us. The Adviser or its affiliates may engage in certain origination activities and receive attendant arrangement, structuring or similar fees. The Adviser is responsible for managing our business and activities, including sourcing investment opportunities, conducting research, performing diligence on potential investments, structuring our investments, and monitoring our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis through a team of investment professionals. The Board consists of seven directors, four of whom are independent.\nWe conduct private offerings (each, a Private Offering\u201d) of our common shares to accredited investors in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. At the closing of each Private Offering, each investor makes a capital commitment (a Capital Commitment\u201d) to purchase shares of our common stock pursuant to a subscription agreement entered into with us. Until the earlier of an Exchange Listing (as defined below) and the end of the Commitment Period (as defined below), investors are required to fund drawdowns to purchase shares of our common stock up to the amount of their respective Capital Commitment on an as-needed basis each time we deliver a drawdown notice to our investors. The initial closing of the Private Offering occurred on August 10, 2018 (the Initial Closing\u201d). As of December 31, 2018, we had $1.8 billion in total Capital Commitments from investors, of which $65.0 million is from entities affiliated with or related to our Adviser. Prior to the listing of our common stock on a national securities exchange (an Exchange Listing\u201d), the Adviser may, in its sole discretion, permit one or more additional closings ( Subsequent Closings\u201d) as additional Capital Commitments are obtained (the conclusion of all Subsequent Closings, if any, the Final Closing\u201d). The Commitment Period\u201d will continue until the earlier of the (i) five year anniversary of the Final Closing and (ii) the seven year anniversary of the Initial Closing. If we have not consummated a listing of our common shares on a national securities exchange by the end of the Commitment Period, subject to extension for two additional one-year periods, in the sole discretion of the Board, the Board (subject to any necessary shareholder approvals and applicable requirements of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act\u201d)) will use its commercially reasonable efforts to wind down and/or liquidate and dissolve the Company in an orderly manner.\nPlacement activities will be conducted by our officers and the Adviser. In addition, we may enter into agreements with placement agents or broker-dealers to solicit Capital Commitments. For example, the Company and the Adviser entered into a dealer manager agreement with Owl Rock Capital Securities LLC ( Owl Rock Securities\u201d) pursuant to which Owl Rock Securities and certain participating broker-dealers will solicit Capital Commitments and the Company entered into a placement agent agreement with Owl Rock Securities pursuant to which employees of Owl Rock Securities may conduct placement activities. Owl Rock Securities, an affiliate of Owl Rock, is registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC and is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. In addition, the Company, the Adviser and third party placement agents may enter into placement agreements from time to time, pursuant to which such placement agents will solicit Capital Commitments. Fees paid pursuant to these agreements will be paid by our Adviser.\nOwl Rock Capital Advisors LLC ( ORCA\u201d), an affiliate of the Adviser, serves as investment adviser to Owl Rock Capital Corporation and Owl Rock Capital Corporation II, both of which were formed under the laws of the State of Maryland and, like us, have elected to be treated as business development companies ( BDC\u201d) under the 1940 Act. Owl Rock Private Fund Advisors LLC ( ORPFA\u201d), an affiliate of the Adviser, services as investment adviser to Owl Rock First Lien Master Fund, L.P. The Adviser is under common control with ORCA and ORPFA, which are also investment advisers and indirect subsidiaries of Owl Rock Capital Partners. The Adviser, ORCA, ORPFA and Owl Rock Capital Partners are referred to, collectively, as Owl Rock.\u201d\nWe may be prohibited under the 1940 Act from participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, the prior approval of the SEC. We intend to rely on exemptive\nrelief, that has been granted by the SEC to Owl Rock Capital Advisors LLC and certain of its affiliates, to permit us to co-invest with other funds managed by the Adviser or certain of its affiliates, including Owl Rock Capital Corporation and Owl Rock Capital Corporation II, in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. Pursuant to such exemptive relief, we generally are permitted to co-invest with certain of our affiliates if a required majority\u201d (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our independent directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the transactions, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our shareholders and do not involve overreaching by us or our shareholders on the part of any person concerned, (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our shareholders and is consistent with our investment objective and strategies, and (3) the investment by our affiliates would not disadvantage us, and our participation would not be on a basis different from or less advantageous than that on which our affiliates are investing. Owl Rock's investment allocation policy seeks to ensure equitable allocation of investment opportunities between us, Owl Rock Capital Corporation, Owl Rock Capital Corporation II, and/or other funds managed by our Adviser or its affiliates. As a result of the exemptive relief, there could be significant overlap in our investment portfolio and the investment portfolio of Owl Rock Capital Corporation, Owl Rock Capital Corporation II and/or other funds established by the Adviser or its affiliates that could avail themselves of the exemptive relief.\nOn September 24, 2018, we formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, OR Tech Lending LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, which is intended to hold a California finance lenders license. OR Tech Lending LLC is intended to originate loans to borrowers headquartered in California.\nWe have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and intend to elect to be treated as a regulated investment company ( RIC\u201d) for tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code\u201d). As a result, we are required to comply with various statutory and regulatory requirements, such as:\n \u2022 the requirement to invest at least 70% of our assets in qualifying assets\u201d, as such term is defined in the 1940 Act; \n \u2022 source of income limitations; \n \u2022 asset diversification requirements; and \n \u2022 the requirement to distribute (or be treated as distributing) in each taxable year at least 90% of our investment company taxable income and tax-exempt interest for that taxable year. \nIn addition, we will not invest more than 20% of our total assets in companies whose principal place of business is outside the United States, although we do not generally intend to invest in companies whose principal place of business is in an emerging market and we have adopted a policy to invest, under normal circumstances at least 80% of the value of our total assets in technology-related\u201d business (as defined below).\nOur Investment Framework\nWe are a Maryland corporation organized primarily to originate and make debt and equity investments in technology-related companies based primarily in the United States. We originate and invest in senior secured or unsecured loans, subordinated loans or mezzanine loans, and equity-related securities including common equity, warrants, preferred stock and similar forms of senior equity, which may or may not be convertible into a portfolio company's common equity. Our investment objective is to maximize total return by generating current income from debt investments and other income producing securities, and capital appreciation from our equity and equity-linked investments. Since our Adviser's affiliates began investment activities in April 2016 through December 31, 2018, our Adviser or its affiliates have originated $11.1 billion aggregate principal amount of investments across multiple industries, of which $9.8 billion of aggregate principal amount of investments prior to any subsequent exits or repayments, was retained by either us or a corporation or fund advised by our Adviser or its affiliates.\nWe intend to invest in a broad range of established and high growth technology and life sciences-related companies that are capitalizing on the large and growing demand for technology products and services. These companies use technology extensively to improve their business processes, applications and opportunities or seek to grow through technological developments and innovations. These companies operate in technology-related industries or sectors which include, but are not limited to, information technology, application or infrastructure software, financial services, data and analytics, security, cloud computing, communications, life sciences, healthcare, media, consumer electronics, semi-conductor, internet commerce and advertising, environmental, aerospace and defense industries and sectors. Within each industry or sector, we intend to invest in companies that are developing or offering goods and services to businesses and consumers which utilize scientific knowledge, including techniques, skills, methods, devices and processes, to solve problems. We refer to all of these companies as technology-related\u201d companies and intend, under normal circumstances, to invest at least 80% of the value of our total assets in such businesses.\nWe expect that generally our portfolio composition will be majority debt or income producing securities, which may include covenant-lite\u201d loans (as defined below), with a lesser allocation to equity or equity-linked opportunities. In addition, we may invest a portion of our portfolio in opportunistic investments, which will not be our primary focus, but will be intended to enhance returns to\nour Shareholders. These investments may include high-yield bonds and broadly-syndicated loans. In addition, we generally do not intend to invest more than 20% of our total assets in companies whose principal place of business is outside the United States, although we do not generally intend to invest in companies whose principal place of business is in an emerging market. Our portfolio composition may fluctuate from time to time based on market conditions and interest rates.\nCovenants are contractual restrictions that lenders place on companies to limit the corporate actions a company may pursue. Generally, the loans in which we expect to invest will have financial maintenance covenants, which are used to proactively address materially adverse changes in a portfolio company's financial performance. However, to a lesser extent, we may invest in covenant-lite\u201d loans. We use the term covenant-lite\u201d to refer generally to loans that do not have a complete set of financial maintenance covenants. Generally, covenant-lite\u201d loans provide borrower companies more freedom to negatively impact lenders because their covenants are incurrence-based, which means they are only tested and can only be breached following an affirmative action of the borrower, rather than by a deterioration in the borrower's financial condition. Accordingly, to the extent we invest in covenant-lite\u201d loans, we may have fewer rights against a borrower and may have a greater risk of loss on such investments as compared to investments in or exposure to loans with financial maintenance covenants.\nThe companies in which we invest use our capital to support their growth, acquisitions, market or product expansion, refinancings and/or recapitalizations. The debt in which we invest typically is not rated by any rating agency, but if these instruments were rated, they would likely receive a rating of below investment grade (that is, below BBB- or Baa3), which is often referred to as high yield\u201d or junk\u201d.\nKey Components of Our Results of Operations\nInvestments\nWe focus primarily on the direct origination of loans to middle market, technology-related companies domiciled in the United States.\nOur level of investment activity (both the number of investments and the size of each investment) can and will vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make.\nIn addition, as part of our risk strategy on investments, we may reduce the levels of certain investments through partial sales or syndication to additional lenders.\nRevenues\nWe generate revenues primarily in the form of interest income from the investments we hold. In addition, we may generate income from dividends on either direct equity investments or equity interests obtained in connection with originating loans, such as options, warrants or conversion rights. Our debt investments typically have a term of three to ten years. As of December 31, 2018, 89.0% of our debt investments based on fair value bear interest at a floating rate, subject to interest rate floors, in certain cases. Interest on our debt investments is generally payable either monthly or quarterly.\nOur investment portfolio consists primarily of floating rate loans. Macro trends in base interest rates like London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) may affect our net investment income over the long term. However, because we generally intend to originate loans to a small number of portfolio companies each quarter, and those investments may vary in size, our results in any given period, including the interest rate on investments that may be sold or repaid in a period compared to the interest rate of new investments made during that period, may be idiosyncratic, and reflect the characteristics of the particular portfolio companies that we invested in or exited during the period and not necessarily any trends in our business or macro trends.\nLoan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income using the effective yield method for term instruments and the straight-line method for revolving or delayed draw instruments. Repayments of our debt investments can reduce interest income from period to period. The frequency or volume of these repayments may fluctuate significantly. We record prepayment premiums on loans as interest income. We may also generate revenue in the form of commitment, loan origination, structuring, or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance to our portfolio companies and possibly consulting fees. Certain of these fees may be capitalized and amortized as additional interest income over the life of the related loan.\nDividend income on equity investments is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded companies.\nOur portfolio activity will also reflect the proceeds from sales of investments. We will recognize realized gains or losses on investments based on the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the amortized cost basis of the investment without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We record current period changes in fair value of investments that are measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized gains (losses) on investments in the consolidated statement of operations.\nExpenses\nOur primary operating expenses include the payment of the management fee, the incentive fee, and expenses reimbursable under the Administration Agreement and Investment Advisory Agreement. The management fee and incentive fee compensate our Adviser for work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, closing, monitoring and realizing our investments.\nExcept as specifically provided below, we anticipate that all investment professionals and staff of the Adviser, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory and management services to us, and the base compensation, bonus and benefits, and the routine overhead expenses, of such personnel allocable to such services, will be provided and paid for by the Adviser. In addition, the Adviser shall be solely responsible for any placement or finder's\u201d fees payable to placement agents engaged by the Company or its affiliates in connection with the offering of securities by the Company. We will bear our allocable portion of the costs of the compensation, benefits and related administrative expenses (including travel expenses) of our officers who provide operational and administrative services hereunder, their respective staffs and other professionals who provide services to us (including, in each case, employees of the Adviser or an affiliate) who assist with the preparation, coordination, and administration of the foregoing or provide other back office\u201d or middle office\u201d financial or operational services to us. We shall reimburse the Adviser (or its affiliates) for an allocable portion of the compensation paid by the Adviser (or its affiliates) to such individuals (based on a percentage of time such individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to our business affairs and in acting on our behalf). We also will bear all other costs and expenses of our operations, administration and transactions, including, but not limited to (i) investment advisory fees, including Management Fees and Incentive Fees, to the Adviser, pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement; (ii) our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Adviser in performing its administrative obligations under the Investment Advisory Agreement and (iii) all other expenses of our operations and transactions including, without limitation, those relating to:\n \u2022 the cost of our organization and any offerings; \n \u2022 the cost of calculating our net asset value, including the cost of any third-party valuation services; \n \u2022 the cost of effecting any sales and repurchases of the Common Stock and other securities; \n \u2022 fees and expenses payable under any dealer manager agreements, if any; \n \u2022 debt service and other costs of borrowings or other financing arrangements; \n \u2022 costs of hedging; \n \u2022 expenses, including travel expense, incurred by the Adviser, or members of the investment team, or payable to third parties, performing due diligence on prospective portfolio companies and, if necessary, enforcing our rights; \n \u2022 escrow agent, transfer agent and custodial fees and expenses; \n \u2022 fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts; \n \u2022 federal and state registration fees, any stock exchange listing fees and fees payable to rating agencies; \n \u2022 federal, state and local taxes; \n \u2022 independent directors' fees and expenses, including certain travel expenses; \n \u2022 costs of preparing financial statements and maintaining books and records and filing reports or other documents with the SEC (or other regulatory bodies) and other reporting and compliance costs, including registration fees, listing fees and licenses, and the compensation of professionals responsible for the preparation of the foregoing; \n \u2022 the costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to our shareholders (including printing and mailing costs); \n \u2022 the costs of any shareholder or director meetings and the compensation of personnel responsible for the preparation of the foregoing and related matters; \n \u2022 commissions and other compensation payable to brokers or dealers; \n \u2022 research and market data; \n \u2022 fidelity bond, directors and officers errors and omissions liability insurance and other insurance premiums; \n \u2022 direct costs and expenses of administration, including printing, mailing, long distance telephone and staff; \n \u2022 fees and expenses associated with independent audits, outside legal and consulting costs; \n \u2022 costs of winding up; \n \u2022 costs incurred in connection with the formation or maintenance of entities or vehicles to hold our assets for tax or other purposes; \n \u2022 extraordinary expenses (such as litigation or indemnification); and \n \u2022 costs associated with reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act and applicable federal and state securities laws. \nWe expect, but cannot ensure, that our general and administrative expenses will increase in dollar terms during periods of asset growth, but will decline as a percentage of total assets during such periods.\nLeverage\nThe amount of leverage we use in any period depends on a variety of factors, including cash available for investing, the cost of financing and general economic and market conditions. We generally will be permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to the common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, would at least be equal to 200% immediately after each such issuance. However, recent legislation has modified the 1940 Act by allowing a BDC to increase the maximum amount of leverage it may incur from an asset coverage ratio of 200% to an asset coverage ratio of 150%, if certain requirements are met. The reduced asset coverage requirement would permit a BDC to double the amount of leverage it can incur. For example, under a 150% asset coverage ratio the Company may borrow $2 for investment purposes of every $1 of investor equity whereas under a 200% asset coverage ratio the Company may only borrow $1 for investment purposes for every $1 of investor equity. On August 7, 2018, our Adviser, as our sole initial shareholder, has approved a proposal that allows us to reduce our asset coverage ratio to 150% and in connection with their subscription agreements, our investors are required to acknowledge our ability to operate with an asset coverage ratio that may be as low as 150%.\nIn any period, our interest expense will depend largely on the extent of our borrowing and we expect interest expense will increase as we increase our leverage over time subject to the limits of the 1940 Act. In addition, we may dedicate assets to financing facilities.\nMarket Trends\nWe believe the technology investment lending environment provides opportunities for us to meet our goal of making investments that generate an attractive total return based on a combination of the following factors:\nLimited Availability of Capital for Technology Companies. We believe that technology companies have limited access to capital, driven by a reduction in activity from commercial and investment banks, and a lack of dedicated pools of capital focused on\ntechnology companies. Traditional lenders, such as commercial and investment banks, generally do not have flexible product offerings that meet the needs of technology-related companies. In recent years, many commercial and investment banks have focused their efforts and resources on lending to large corporate clients and managing capital markets transactions rather than lending to technology-related companies. In addition, these lenders may be constrained in their ability to underwrite and hold loans and high yield securities, as well as their ability to provide equity financing, as they seek to meet existing and future regulatory capital requirements. We also believe that there is a lack of scaled market participants that are willing to provide and hold meaningful amounts of a customized financing solution for technology companies. As a result, we believe our focus on technology-related companies and our ability to invest across the capital structure, coupled with a limited supply of capital providers, presents an attractive opportunity to invest in technology companies.\nCapital Markets Have Been Unable to Fill the Void Left by Banks. While underwritten bond and syndicated loan markets have been robust in recent years, many technology companies are less able to access these markets for reasons including the following:\nHigh Yield Market - Many technology companies generally are not issuing debt in an amount large enough to be an attractively sized bond. High yield bonds are generally purchased by institutional investors who, among other things, are highly focused on the liquidity characteristics of the bond being issued. For example, mutual funds and exchange traded funds ( ETFs\u201d) are significant buyers of underwritten bonds. However, mutual funds and ETFs generally require the ability to liquidate their investments quickly in order to fund investor redemptions and/or comply with regulatory requirements. Accordingly, the existence of an active secondary market for bonds is an important consideration in these entities' initial investment decision. Because there is typically little or no active secondary market for the debt of U.S. middle market companies, mutual funds and ETFs generally do not provide debt capital to technology companies. We believe this is likely to be a persistent problem and creates an advantage for those like us who have a more stable capital base and have the ability to invest in illiquid assets.\nSyndicated Loan Market - Loan issue size and liquidity are key drivers of institutional appetite and, correspondingly, underwriters' willingness to underwrite the loans. Loans arranged through a bank are done either on a best efforts\u201d basis or are underwritten with terms plus provisions that permit the underwriters to change certain terms, including pricing, structure, yield and\ntenor, otherwise known as flex\u201d, to successfully syndicate the loan, in the event the terms initially marketed are insufficiently attractive to investors. Loans provided by companies such as ours provide certainty to issuers in that we can commit to a given amount of debt on specific terms, at stated coupons and with agreed upon fees. As we are the ultimate holder of the loans, we do not require market flex\u201d or other arrangements that banks may require when acting on an agency basis.\nRobust Demand for Debt Capital. According to S&P Capital IQ, there was approximately $1.2 trillion of mergers and acquisitions activity in the technology and software industries from 2013 through 2017. We believe technology companies will continue to require access to capital to refinance existing debt, support growth and finance acquisitions. In addition, we believe the large amount of uninvested capital held by funds of private equity firms, estimated by Preqin Ltd., an alternative assets industry data and research company, to be $1.2 trillion as of December 2018, coupled with a growing focus on technology investing by private equity sponsors, will continue to drive deal activity. We expect that technology companies, private equity sponsors, venture capital firms, and entrepreneurs will continue to seek partners to provide flexible financing for their businesses with debt and equity investments provided by companies such as us.\nTechnology Spend is Large and Increasing. According to Gartner, a research and advisory company, global technology spend was $3.5 trillion in 2017 and is expected to grow to more than $4.0 trillion by 2021. We believe global demand for technology products and services will continue to grow rapidly, and that that growth will stimulate demand for capital from technology companies.\nAttractive Investment Dynamics. An imbalance between the supply of, and demand for, capital creates attractive pricing dynamics. With respect to the debt investments in technology companies, we believe the directly negotiated nature of such financings generally provides more favorable terms to the lender, including stronger covenant and reporting packages, better call protection, and lender protective change of control provisions. Further, we believe that historical default rates for technology and software companies have been lower, and recovery rates have been higher, as compared to the broader leveraged finance market, leading to lower cumulative losses. With respect to equity and equity-linked investments, we will seek to structure these investments with meaningful shareholder protections, including, but not limited to, anti-dilution, anti-layering, and liquidation preferences, which we believe will create the potential for meaningful risk-adjusted long-term capital gains in connection with the future liquidity events of these technology companies.\nCompelling Business Models. We believe that the products and services that technology companies provide often have high switching costs and are fundamental to the operations and success of their customers. As a result, technology companies have attributes that make them compelling investments, including strong customer retention rates, and highly recurring and predictable revenue. Further, technology companies are typically highly capital efficient, with limited capital expenditures and high free cash flow conversion.\nAttractive Opportunities in Investments in Technology Companies. We invest in the debt and equity of technology companies. We believe that opportunities in the debt of technology companies are significant because of the floating rate structure of most senior secured debt issuances and because of the strong defensive characteristics of these types of investments. Given the current low interest rate environment, we believe that debt issues with floating interest rates offer a superior return profile as compared with fixed-rate investments, since floating rate structures are generally less susceptible to declines in value experienced by fixed-rate securities in a rising interest rate environment. Senior secured debt also provides strong defensive characteristics. Senior secured debt has priority in payment among an issuer's security holders whereby holders are due to receive payment before junior creditors and equity holders. Further, these investments are generally secured by the issuer's assets, which may provide protection in the event of a default.\nWe believe that opportunities in the equity of technology companies are significant because of the potential to generate meaningful capital appreciation by participating in the growth in the portfolio company and the demand for its products and services. Moreover, we believe that the high-growth profile of a technology company will generally make it a more attractive candidate for a liquidity event than a company in a non-high growth industry.\nPortfolio and Investment Activity\nAs of December 31, 2018, based on fair value, our portfolio consisted of 81.6% first lien senior secured debt investments, 7.4% second lien senior secured debt investments and 11.0% unsecured debt investments.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our weighted average total yield of the portfolio at fair value and amortized cost was 8.0% and 8.0%, respectively, and our weighted average yield of debt and income producing securities at fair value and amortized cost was 8.0% and 8.0%, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2018 we had investments in six portfolio companies with an aggregate fair value of $262.8 million.\nOur investment activity for the period ended December 31, 2018 is presented below (information presented herein is at par value unless

There can be no assurance that the weighted average yield will remain at its current level.\nOur Adviser monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. It monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if they are meeting their respective business plans and to assess the appropriate course of action with respect to each portfolio company. Our Adviser has several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which may include the following:\n \u2022 assessment of success of the portfolio company in adhering to its business plan and compliance with covenants; \n \u2022 periodic and regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor, to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments; \n \u2022 comparisons to other companies in the portfolio company's industry; and \n \u2022 review of monthly or quarterly financial statements and financial projections for portfolio companies. \nAs part of the monitoring process, our Adviser employs an investment rating system to categorize our investments. In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, our Adviser rates the credit risk of all investments on a scale of 1 to 5. This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio investment relative to our initial cost basis in respect of such portfolio investment (i.e., at the time of origination or acquisition), although it may also take into account the performance of the portfolio company's business, the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors. The rating system is as follows:\n Investment Rating Description Investments with a rating of 1 involve the least amount of risk to our initial cost basis. The borrower is performing above expectations, and the trends and risk factors for this investment since origination or acquisition are generally favorable; Investments rated 2 involve an acceptable level of risk that is similar to the risk at the time of origination or acquisition. The borrower is generally performing as expected and the risk factors are neutral to favorable. All investments or acquired investments in new portfolio companies are initially assessed a rate of 2; Investments rated 3 involve a borrower performing below expectations and indicates that the loan's risk has increased somewhat since origination or acquisition; \n Investments rated 4 involve a borrower performing materially below expectations and indicates that the loan's risk has increased materially since origination or acquisition. In addition to the borrower being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, loan payments may be past due (but generally not more than 120 days past due); and Investments rated 5 involve a borrower performing substantially below expectations and indicates that the loan's risk has increased substantially since origination or acquisition. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. Loans rated 5 are not anticipated to be repaid in full and we will reduce the fair value of the loan to the amount we anticipate will be recovered. \nOur Adviser rates the investments in our portfolio at least quarterly and it is possible that the rating of a portfolio investment may be reduced or increased over time. For investments rated 3, 4 or 5, our Adviser enhances its level of scrutiny over the monitoring of such portfolio company.\nThe following table shows the composition of our portfolio on the 1 to 5 rating scale as of December 31, 2018:\nTable 196: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment Rating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Investments\nat Fair Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage of\nTotal Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 262,833\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 262,833\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table shows the amortized cost of our performing and non-accrual debt investments as of December 31, 2018:\nTable 197: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amortized Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Performing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 263,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-accrual\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 263,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoans are generally placed on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Accrued interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management's judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid current and, in management's judgment, are likely to remain current. Management may make exceptions to this treatment and determine to not place a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table represents the operating results for the period ended December 31, 2018:\nTable 198: <table> <tr> <td> ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Period from July 12, 2018 (Inception) to December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Investment Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Investment Income (Loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net change in unrealized gain (loss) on investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets Resulting from Operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations can vary from period to period as a result of various factors, including the level of new investment commitments, expenses, the recognition of realized gains and losses and changes in unrealized appreciation and depreciation on the investment portfolio. Additionally, we were initially capitalized on August 7, 2018 and commenced investing activities in September 2018. As a result, comparisons may not be meaningful.\nInvestment Income\nInvestment income for the period ended December 31, 2018 were as follows:\nTable 199: <table> <tr> <td> ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Period from July 12, 2018 (Inception) to December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income from investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total investment income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe generate revenues primarily in the form of interest income from the investments we hold. In addition, we may generate income from dividends on either direct equity investments or equity interests obtained in connection with originating loans, such as options, warrants or conversion rights.\nExpenses\nExpenses for the period ended December 31, 2018 were as follows:\nTable 200: <table> <tr> <td> ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Period from July 12, 2018 (Inception) to December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Initial organization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Management fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Directors' fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnder the terms of the Administration Agreement, we reimburse the Adviser for services performed for us. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Administration Agreement, the Adviser may delegate its obligations under the Administration Agreement to an affiliate or to a third party and we reimburse the Adviser for any services performed for us by such affiliate or third party.\nIncome Taxes, Including Excise Taxes\nWe intend to elect to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, and we intend to operate in a manner so as to continue to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify for tax treatment as a RIC, we must, among other things, distribute to our shareholders in each taxable year generally at least 90% of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, and net tax-exempt income for that taxable year. To maintain our tax treatment as a RIC, we, among other things, intend to make the requisite distributions to our shareholders, which generally relieves us from corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes.\nDepending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we can be expected to carry forward taxable income (including net capital gains, if any) in excess of current year dividend distributions from the current tax year into the next tax year and pay a nondeductible 4% U.S. federal excise tax on such taxable income, as required. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions from such income, we will accrue excise tax on estimated excess taxable income.\nFor the period ended December 31, 2018 we did not accrue U.S. federal excise tax.\nNet Change in Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Investments\nWe fair value our portfolio investments quarterly and any changes in fair value are recorded as unrealized gains or losses. During the period ended December 31, 2018, net unrealized gains (losses) on our investment portfolio were comprised of the following:\nTable 201: <table> <tr> <td> ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Period from July 12, 2018 (Inception) to December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net change in unrealized gain (loss) on investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net change in unrealized gain (loss) on investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOur liquidity and capital resources are generated primarily from the proceeds of capital drawdowns of our privately placed Capital Commitments, cash flows from interest, dividends and fees earned from our investments and principal repayments, and our credit facilities. The primary uses of our cash are (i) investments in portfolio companies and other investments and to comply with certain portfolio diversification requirements, (ii) the cost of operations (including paying our Adviser) and (iii) cash distributions to the holders of our shares.\nWe may from time to time enter into additional debt facilities, increase the size of our existing credit facilities or issue additional debt securities. Any such incurrence or issuance would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. In accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to incur borrowings, issue debt securities or issue preferred stock, if immediately after the borrowing or issuance, the ratio of total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness) to total indebtedness plus preferred stock, is at least 150%. As of December 31, 2018, our asset coverage ratio was 195%. We seek to carefully consider our unfunded commitments for the purpose of planning our ongoing financial leverage. Further, we maintain sufficient borrowing capacity within the 150% asset coverage limitation to cover any outstanding unfunded commitments we are required to fund.\nCash as of December 31, 2018, taken together with our uncalled Capital Commitments of $1.5 billion and available debt capacity of $50.0 million, is expected to be sufficient for our investing activities and to conduct our operations in the near term.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $323.0 million in cash. During the period ended December 31, 2018, we used $263.5 million in cash for operating activities, primarily as a result of funding portfolio investments of $262.8 million, partially offset by other operating activity of $0.7 million. Lastly, cash provided by financing activities was $586.6 million during the period, which was the result of proceeds from the issuance of shares, net of offering costs paid, of $289.0 million and proceeds from net borrowing on our credit facilities, net of debt issuance costs, of $297.6 million.\nEquity\nSubscriptions and Drawdowns\nIn connection with our formation, we have the authority to issue 500,000,000 common shares at $0.01 per share par value.\nOn August 7, 2018, we issued 100 common shares for $1,500 to Owl Rock Technology Advisors LLC, which subsequently became our Adviser on August 10, 2018.\nWe have entered into subscription agreements (the Subscription Agreements\u201d) with investors providing for the private placement of our common shares. Under the terms of the Subscription Agreements, investors are required to fund drawdowns to purchase our common shares up to the amount of their respective Capital Commitment on an as-needed basis each time we deliver a capital call notice to its investors.\nDuring the period ended December 31, 2018, we delivered the following capital call notices to investors:\nTable 202: <table> <tr> <td> Capital Drawdown Notice Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Common Share Issuance Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Number of Common Shares Issued\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Aggregate Offering Price\n($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> August 20, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> August 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,666,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 40.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> September 13, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> September 26, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,168,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 120.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> November 26, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 7, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,904,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 129.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,738,951\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 289.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDistributions\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we did not declare any distributions on shares of our common stock. On February 27, 2019, our Board declared a distribution of 90% of estimated first quarter taxable income and net capital gains, if any, for shareholders of record on March 31, 2019, payable on or before May 15, 2019.\nDividend Reinvestment\nWith respect to distributions, we adopted an opt out\u201d dividend reinvestment plan for common shareholders. As a result, in the event of a declared distribution, each shareholder that has not opted out\u201d of the dividend reinvestment plan will have their dividends or distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock rather than receiving cash distributions. Shareholders who receive distributions in the form of shares of common stock will be subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash distributions.\nDebt\nAggregate Borrowings\nDebt obligations consisted of the following as of December 31, 2018:\nTable 203: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Aggregate Principal Committed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Outstanding Principal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount Available(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net Carrying Value(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subscription Credit Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 350,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 50,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 297,555\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 350,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 50,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 297,555\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n________________\n (1) The amount available reflects any limitations related to each credit facility's borrowing base. \n (2) The carrying value of our Subscription Credit Facility is presented net of debt issuance costs of $2.4 million. \nFor the period ended December 31, 2018, the components of interest expense were as follows:\nTable 206: <table> <tr> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Period from July 12, 2018 (Inception) to December 31, 2018(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of debt issuance costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Interest Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.91\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average daily borrowings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n________________\n (1) Average reflects the period from November 19, 2018, the date of the agreement, through December 31, 2018. \nSubscription Credit Facility\nOn November 19, 2018 (the Closing Date\u201d), Owl Rock Technology Finance Corp. (the Company\u201d) entered into a revolving credit facility (the Subscription Credit Facility\u201d) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ( Wells Fargo\u201d) as administrative agent (the Administrative Agent\u201d), and Wells Fargo, PNC Bank, National Association ( PNC\u201d), and State Street Bank and Trust\nCompany ( State Street\u201d), as lenders, with a maximum principal amount of the Subscription Credit Facility of $350 million, subject to availability under the borrowing base, which is based on unused capital commitments.\nOn February 25, 2019, the maximum principal amount of the Subscription Credit Facility was increased to $450 million, subject to availability under the borrowing base, which is based on unused capital commitments. The maximum principal amount of the Subscription Credit Facility may be further increased upon request of the Company up to $700 million, subject to customary conditions, and the Subscription Credit Facility also includes a provision permitting the Company to further increase the size of the Subscription Credit Facility under certain circumstances up to a maximum principal amount not to exceed $1 billion, if the existing or new lenders agree to commit to such further increase. Borrowings under the Subscription Credit Facility bear interest, at the Company's election at the time of drawdown, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of LIBOR rate loans, an adjusted LIBOR rate for the applicable interest period plus 1.50% or (ii) in the case of reference rate loans, the greatest of (A) a prime rate plus 0.50%, (B) the federal funds rate plus 1.00%, and (C) one-month LIBOR plus 1.50%. Loans may be converted from one rate to another at any time at the Company's election, subject to certain conditions. The Company also will pay an unused commitment fee of 0.25% per annum on the unused commitments.\nThe Subscription Credit Facility will mature upon the earliest of: (i) the date three (3) years from the Closing Date (the Stated Maturity Date\u201d); (ii) the date upon which the Administrative Agent declares the obligations under the Subscription Credit Facility due and payable after the occurrence of an event of default; (iii) forty-five (45) days prior to the scheduled termination of the commitment period under the Company's subscription agreements; (iv) forty-five (45) days prior to the date of any listing of the Company's common stock on a national securities exchange; (v) the termination of the commitment period under the Company's subscription agreements (if earlier than the scheduled date); and (vi) the date the Company terminates the commitments pursuant to the Subscription Credit Facility. At the Company's option, the Stated Maturity Date may be extended by up to 364 days, subject to satisfaction of customary conditions.\nThe Subscription Credit Facility is secured by a perfected first priority security interest in the Company's right, title, and interest in and to the capital commitments of the Company's private investors, including the Company's right to make capital calls, receive and apply capital contributions, enforce remedies and claims related thereto together with capital call proceeds and related rights, and a pledge of the collateral account into which capital call proceeds are deposited.\nThe Subscription Credit Facility contains customary covenants, including certain limitations on the incurrence by us of additional indebtedness and on our ability to make distributions to our shareholders, or redeem, repurchase or retire shares of stock, upon the occurrence of certain events, and customary events of default (with customary cure and notice provisions).\nTransfers of interests in the Company by investors must comply with certain sections of the Subscription Credit Facility and we shall notify the Administrative Agent before such transfers take place. Such transfers may trigger mandatory prepayment obligations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nPortfolio Company Commitments\nFrom time to time, we may enter into commitments to fund investments. As of December 31, 2018, we had the following outstanding commitments to fund investments in current portfolio companies:\nTable 208: <table> <tr> <td> Portfolio Company\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Investment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cheese Acquisition, LLC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> First lien senior secured delayed draw term loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 31,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cheese Acquisition, LLC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> First lien senior secured revolving loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,545\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gerson Lehrman Group, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> First lien senior secured revolving loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lightning Midco, LLC (dba Vector Solutions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> First lien senior secured delayed draw term loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lightning Midco, LLC (dba Vector Solutions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> First lien senior secured revolving loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Unfunded Portfolio Company Commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 65,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company maintains sufficient capacity to cover outstanding unfunded portfolio company commitments that the Company may be required to fund.\nInvestor Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $1.8 billion in total Capital Commitments from our investors ($1.5 billion undrawn), of which $65.0 million is from an affiliate of our Adviser ($58.4 million undrawn). These undrawn Capital Commitments will no longer remain in effect following the completion of an initial public offering of our common stock.\nOther Commitments and Contingencies\nFrom time to time, we may become a party to certain legal proceedings incidental to the normal course of its business. At December 31, 2018, management was not aware of any pending or threatened litigation.\nRelated-Party Transactions\nWe have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following:\n \u2022 the Investment Advisory Agreement; \n \u2022 the Administration Agreement; \n \u2022 the Dealer Manager Agreement; \n \u2022 the Placement Agent Agreement; and \n \u2022 the License Agreement. \nIn addition to the aforementioned agreements, we intend to rely on exemptive relief that has been granted to ORCA and certain of its affiliates to permit us to co-invest with other funds managed by our Adviser or certain of its affiliates including Owl Rock Capital Corporation and Owl Rock Capital Corporation II in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. See ITEM 1. - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 3. Agreements and Related Party Transactions\u201d for further details.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. Our critical accounting policies should be read in connection with our risk factors as described in ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\u201d\nInvestments at Fair Value\nInvestment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds received (excluding prepayment fees, if any) and the amortized cost basis of the investment using the specific identification method without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized, and include investments charged off during the period, net of recoveries. The net change in unrealized gains or losses primarily reflects the change in investment values, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains or losses with respect to investments realized during the period.\nInvestments for which market quotations are readily available are typically valued at the bid price of those market quotations. To validate market quotations, we utilize a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and number of the quotations. Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available, as is the case for substantially all of our investments, are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board, based on, among other things, the input of the Adviser, our audit committee and independent third-party valuation firm(s) engaged at the direction of the Board.\nAs part of the valuation process, the Board takes into account relevant factors in determining the fair value of our investments, including: the estimated enterprise value of a portfolio company (i.e., the total fair value of the portfolio company's debt and equity), the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments based on its earnings and cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, a comparison of the portfolio company's securities to any similar publicly traded securities, and overall changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets that may affect the price at which similar investments may be made in the future. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, the Board considers whether the pricing indicated by the external event corroborates its valuation.\nThe Board undertakes a multi-step valuation process, which includes, among other procedures, the following:\n \u2022 With respect to investments for which market quotations are readily available, those investments will typically be valued at the bid price of those market quotations; \n \u2022 With respect to investment for which market quotations are not readily available, the valuation process begins with the independent valuation firm(s) providing a preliminary valuation of each investment to the Adviser's valuation committee; \n \u2022 Preliminary valuation conclusions are documented and discussed with the Adviser's valuation committee. Agreed upon valuation recommendations are presented to the Audit Committee; \n \u2022 The Audit Committee reviews the valuations recommendations and recommends values for each investment to the Board; and \n \u2022 The Board reviews the recommended valuations and determines the fair value of each investment. \nWe conduct this valuation process on a quarterly basis.\nWe apply Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 820, Fair Value Measurements ( ASC 820\u201d), as amended, which establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP and required disclosures of fair value measurements. ASC 820 determines fair value to be the price that would be received for an investment in a current sale, which assumes an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market (which may be a hypothetical market) that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. In accordance with ASC 820, we consider its principal market to be the market that has the greatest volume and level of activity. ASC 820 specifies a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes and ranks the level of observability of inputs used in determination of fair value. In accordance with ASC 820, these levels are summarized below:\n \u2022 Level 1 - Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access. \n \u2022 Level 2 - Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. \n \u2022 Level 3 - Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. \nTransfers between levels, if any, are recognized at the beginning of the quarter in which the transfer occurred. In addition to using the above inputs in investment valuations, we apply the valuation policy approved by our Board that is consistent with ASC 820. Consistent with the valuation policy, we evaluate the source of the inputs, including any markets in which our investments are trading (or any markets in which securities with similar attributes are trading), in determining fair value. When an investment is valued based on prices provided by reputable dealers or pricing services (that is, broker quotes), we subject those prices to various criteria in making the determination as to whether a particular investment would qualify for treatment as a Level 2 or Level 3 investment. For example, we, or the independent valuation firm(s), review pricing support provided by dealers or pricing services in order to determine if observable market information is being used, versus unobservable inputs.\nDue to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of such investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that may ultimately be realized. Further, such investments are generally less liquid than publicly traded securities and may be subject to contractual and other restrictions on resale. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, it could realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material.\nIn addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected herein.\nInterest and Dividend Income Recognition\nInterest income is recorded on the accrual basis and includes amortization of discounts or premiums. Discounts and premiums to par value on securities purchased are amortized into interest income over the contractual life of the respective security using the effective yield method. The amortized cost of investments represents the original cost adjusted for the amortization of discounts or premiums, if any. Upon prepayment of a loan or debt security, any prepayment premiums, unamortized upfront loan origination fees and unamortized discounts are recorded as interest income in the current period.\nLoans are generally placed on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Accrued interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management's judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual\nloans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid current and, in management's judgment, are likely to remain current. Management may make exceptions to this treatment and determine to not place a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.\nDividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly-traded portfolio companies.\nDistributions\nWe intend to elect to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and qualify annually thereafter, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. To obtain and maintain our tax treatment as a RIC, we must distribute (or be deemed to distribute) in each taxable year distribution for tax purposes equal to at least 90 percent of the sum of our:\n \u2022 investment company taxable income (which is generally our ordinary income plus the excess of realized short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid, for such taxable year; and \n \u2022 net tax-exempt interest income (which is the excess of our gross tax-exempt interest income over certain disallowed deductions) for such taxable year. \nAs a RIC, we (but not our shareholders) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal tax on investment company taxable income and net capital gains that we distribute to our shareholders.\nWe intend to distribute annually all or substantially all of such income. To the extent that we retain our net capital gains or any investment company taxable income, we generally will be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax. We can be expected to carry forward our net capital gains or any investment company taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions, and pay the U.S. federal excise tax as described below.\nAmounts not distributed on a timely basis in accordance with a calendar year distribution requirement are subject to a nondeductible 4% U.S. federal excise tax payable by us. We may be subject to a nondeductible 4% U.S. federal excise tax if we do not distribute (or are treated as distributing) during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of:\n \u2022 98% of our net ordinary income excluding certain ordinary gains or losses for that calendar year; \n \u2022 98.2% of our capital gain net income, adjusted for certain ordinary gains and losses, recognized for the twelve-month period ending on October 31 of that calendar year; and \n \u2022 100% of any income or gains recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years. \nWhile we intend to distribute any income and capital gains in the manner necessary to minimize imposition of the 4% U.S. federal excise tax, sufficient amounts of our taxable income and capital gains may not be distributed and as a result, in such cases, the excise tax will be imposed. In such an event, we will be liable for this tax only on the amount by which we do not meet the foregoing distribution requirement.\nWe intend to pay quarterly distributions to our shareholders out of assets legally available for distribution. All distributions will be paid at the discretion of our Board and will depend on our earnings, financial condition, maintenance of our tax treatment as a RIC, compliance with applicable BDC regulations and such other factors as our Board may deem relevant from time to time.\nTo the extent our current taxable earnings for a year fall below the total amount of our distributions for that year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, the source of a distribution to our shareholders may be the original capital invested by the shareholder rather than our income or gains. Shareholders should read written disclosure carefully and should not assume that the source of any distribution is our ordinary income or gains.\nWe have adopted an opt out\u201d dividend reinvestment plan for our common shareholders. As a result, if we declare a cash dividend or other distribution, each shareholder that has not opted out\u201d of our dividend reinvestment plan will have their dividends or distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock rather than receiving cash distributions. Shareholders who receive distributions in the form of shares of common stock will be subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash distributions.\nIncome Taxes\nWe have elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We also intend to elect to be treated as a RIC under the Code beginning with its taxable period ending December 31, 2018. So long as we maintain our tax treatment as a RIC, we generally will not pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute at least annually to our shareholders as dividends. Instead, any tax liability related to income earned and distributed by us represents obligations of our investors and will not be reflected in our consolidated financial statements.\nTo qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. In addition, to qualify for RIC tax treatment, we must distribute to its shareholders, for each taxable year, at least 90% of our investment company taxable income\u201d for that year, which is generally our ordinary income plus the excess of our realized net short-term capital gains over our realized net long-term capital losses. In order for us not to be subject to U.S. federal excise taxes, we must distribute annually an amount at least equal to the sum of (i) 98% of our net ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for the calendar year, (ii) 98.2% of our capital gains in excess of capital losses for the one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year and (iii) any net ordinary income and capital gains in excess of capital losses for preceding years that were not distributed during such years. We, at our discretion, may carry forward taxable income in excess of calendar year dividends and pay a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on this income.\nWe do not currently qualify as a publicly offered regulated investment company,\u201d as defined in the Code. Accordingly, shareholders may be taxed as though they received a distribution of some of our expenses. A publicly offered regulated investment company\u201d is a RIC whose shares are either (i) continuously offered pursuant to a public offering, (ii) regularly traded on an established securities market, or (iii) held by at least 500 persons at all times during the taxable year. The Company cannot determine when it will qualify as a publicly offered RIC. If we do not qualify as a publicly offered RIC during the tax year, a non-corporate shareholder's allocable portion of our affected expenses, including a portion of its management fees, will be treated as an additional distribution to shareholders. A non-corporate shareholder's allocable portion of these expenses are treated as miscellaneous itemized deductions that are not currently deductible by such shareholders.\nWe evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing our consolidated financial statements to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not\u201d to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not\u201d threshold are reserved and recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. All penalties and interest associated with income taxes are included in income tax expense. Conclusions regarding tax positions are subject to review and may be adjusted at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, on-going analyses of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. There were no material uncertain tax positions through December 31, 2018.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with ITEM 8. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u201d. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, which relate to future events or the future performance or financial condition of Owl Rock Technology Finance Corp. and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\u201d This discussion also should be read in conjunction with the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements\u201d set forth on page 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Actual results could differ materially from those implied or expressed in any forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nOwl Rock Technology Finance Corp. (the Company\u201d, we\u201d, us\u201d or our\u201d) is a Maryland corporation formed on July 12, 2018. We were formed primarily to originate and make debt and equity investments in technology-related companies based primarily in the United States. We intend to originate and invest in senior secured or unsecured loans, subordinated loans or mezzanine loans, and equity-related securities including common equity, warrants, preferred stock and similar forms of senior equity, which may or may not be convertible into a portfolio company's common equity. Our investment objective is to maximize total return by generating current income from our debt investments and other income producing securities, and capital appreciation from our equity and equity-linked investments.\nWe are managed by Owl Rock Technology Advisors LLC ( the Adviser\u201d or our Adviser\u201d). The Adviser is registered with the SEC as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Subject to the overall supervision of our board of directors (the Board\u201d), the Adviser manages our day-to-day operations, and provides investment advisory and management services to us. The Adviser or its affiliates may engage in certain origination activities and receive attendant arrangement, structuring or similar fees. The Adviser is responsible for managing our business and activities, including sourcing investment opportunities, conducting research, performing diligence on potential investments, structuring our investments, and monitoring our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis through a team of investment professionals. The Board consists of seven directors, four of whom are independent.\nWe conduct private offerings (each, a Private Offering\u201d) of our common shares to accredited investors in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. At the closing of each Private Offering, each investor makes a capital commitment (a Capital Commitment\u201d) to purchase shares of our common stock pursuant to a subscription agreement entered into with us. Until the earlier of an Exchange Listing (as defined below) and the end of the Commitment Period (as defined below), investors are required to fund drawdowns to purchase shares of our common stock up to the amount of their respective Capital Commitment on an as-needed basis each time we deliver a drawdown notice to our investors. The initial closing of the Private Offering occurred on August 10, 2018 (the Initial Closing\u201d). As of December 31, 2018, we had $1.8 billion in total Capital Commitments from investors, of which $65.0 million is from entities affiliated with or related to our Adviser. Prior to the listing of our common stock on a national securities exchange (an Exchange Listing\u201d), the Adviser may, in its sole discretion, permit one or more additional closings ( Subsequent Closings\u201d) as additional Capital Commitments are obtained (the conclusion of all Subsequent Closings, if any, the Final Closing\u201d). The Commitment Period\u201d will continue until the earlier of the (i) five year anniversary of the Final Closing and (ii) the seven year anniversary of the Initial Closing. If we have not consummated a listing of our common shares on a national securities exchange by the end of the Commitment Period, subject to extension for two additional one-year periods, in the sole discretion of the Board, the Board (subject to any necessary shareholder approvals and applicable requirements of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act\u201d)) will use its commercially reasonable efforts to wind down and/or liquidate and dissolve the Company in an orderly manner.\nPlacement activities will be conducted by our officers and the Adviser. In addition, we may enter into agreements with placement agents or broker-dealers to solicit Capital Commitments. For example, the Company and the Adviser entered into a dealer manager agreement with Owl Rock Capital Securities LLC ( Owl Rock Securities\u201d) pursuant to which Owl Rock Securities and certain participating broker-dealers will solicit Capital Commitments and the Company entered into a placement agent agreement with Owl Rock Securities pursuant to which employees of Owl Rock Securities may conduct placement activities. Owl Rock Securities, an affiliate of Owl Rock, is registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC and is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. In addition, the Company, the Adviser and third party placement agents may enter into placement agreements from time to time, pursuant to which such placement agents will solicit Capital Commitments. Fees paid pursuant to these agreements will be paid by our Adviser.\nOwl Rock Capital Advisors LLC ( ORCA\u201d), an affiliate of the Adviser, serves as investment adviser to Owl Rock Capital Corporation and Owl Rock Capital Corporation II, both of which were formed under the laws of the State of Maryland and, like us, have elected to be treated as business development companies ( BDC\u201d) under the 1940 Act. Owl Rock Private Fund Advisors LLC ( ORPFA\u201d), an affiliate of the Adviser, services as investment adviser to Owl Rock First Lien Master Fund, L.P. The Adviser is under common control with ORCA and ORPFA, which are also investment advisers and indirect subsidiaries of Owl Rock Capital Partners. The Adviser, ORCA, ORPFA and Owl Rock Capital Partners are referred to, collectively, as Owl Rock.\u201d\nWe may be prohibited under the 1940 Act from participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, the prior approval of the SEC. We intend to rely on exemptive\nrelief, that has been granted by the SEC to Owl Rock Capital Advisors LLC and certain of its affiliates, to permit us to co-invest with other funds managed by the Adviser or certain of its affiliates, including Owl Rock Capital Corporation and Owl Rock Capital Corporation II, in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. Pursuant to such exemptive relief, we generally are permitted to co-invest with certain of our affiliates if a required majority\u201d (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our independent directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the transactions, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our shareholders and do not involve overreaching by us or our shareholders on the part of any person concerned, (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our shareholders and is consistent with our investment objective and strategies, and (3) the investment by our affiliates would not disadvantage us, and our participation would not be on a basis different from or less advantageous than that on which our affiliates are investing. Owl Rock's investment allocation policy seeks to ensure equitable allocation of investment opportunities between us, Owl Rock Capital Corporation, Owl Rock Capital Corporation II, and/or other funds managed by our Adviser or its affiliates. As a result of the exemptive relief, there could be significant overlap in our investment portfolio and the investment portfolio of Owl Rock Capital Corporation, Owl Rock Capital Corporation II and/or other funds established by the Adviser or its affiliates that could avail themselves of the exemptive relief.\nOn September 24, 2018, we formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, OR Tech Lending LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, which is intended to hold a California finance lenders license. OR Tech Lending LLC is intended to originate loans to borrowers headquartered in California.\nWe have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and intend to elect to be treated as a regulated investment company ( RIC\u201d) for tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code\u201d). As a result, we are required to comply with various statutory and regulatory requirements, such as:\n \u2022 the requirement to invest at least 70% of our assets in qualifying assets\u201d, as such term is defined in the 1940 Act; \n \u2022 source of income limitations; \n \u2022 asset diversification requirements; and \n \u2022 the requirement to distribute (or be treated as distributing) in each taxable year at least 90% of our investment company taxable income and tax-exempt interest for that taxable year. \nIn addition, we will not invest more than 20% of our total assets in companies whose principal place of business is outside the United States, although we do not generally intend to invest in companies whose principal place of business is in an emerging market and we have adopted a policy to invest, under normal circumstances at least 80% of the value of our total assets in technology-related\u201d business (as defined below).\nOur Investment Framework\nWe are a Maryland corporation organized primarily to originate and make debt and equity investments in technology-related companies based primarily in the United States. We originate and invest in senior secured or unsecured loans, subordinated loans or mezzanine loans, and equity-related securities including common equity, warrants, preferred stock and similar forms of senior equity, which may or may not be convertible into a portfolio company's common equity. Our investment objective is to maximize total return by generating current income from debt investments and other income producing securities, and capital appreciation from our equity and equity-linked investments. Since our Adviser's affiliates began investment activities in April 2016 through December 31, 2018, our Adviser or its affiliates have originated $11.1 billion aggregate principal amount of investments across multiple industries, of which $9.8 billion of aggregate principal amount of investments prior to any subsequent exits or repayments, was retained by either us or a corporation or fund advised by our Adviser or its affiliates.\nWe intend to invest in a broad range of established and high growth technology and life sciences-related companies that are capitalizing on the large and growing demand for technology products and services. These companies use technology extensively to improve their business processes, applications and opportunities or seek to grow through technological developments and innovations. These companies operate in technology-related industries or sectors which include, but are not limited to, information technology, application or infrastructure software, financial services, data and analytics, security, cloud computing, communications, life sciences, healthcare, media, consumer electronics, semi-conductor, internet commerce and advertising, environmental, aerospace and defense industries and sectors. Within each industry or sector, we intend to invest in companies that are developing or offering goods and services to businesses and consumers which utilize scientific knowledge, including techniques, skills, methods, devices and processes, to solve problems. We refer to all of these companies as technology-related\u201d companies and intend, under normal circumstances, to invest at least 80% of the value of our total assets in such businesses.\nWe expect that generally our portfolio composition will be majority debt or income producing securities, which may include covenant-lite\u201d loans (as defined below), with a lesser allocation to equity or equity-linked opportunities. In addition, we may invest a portion of our portfolio in opportunistic investments, which will not be our primary focus, but will be intended to enhance returns to\nour Shareholders. These investments may include high-yield bonds and broadly-syndicated loans. In addition, we generally do not intend to invest more than 20% of our total assets in companies whose principal place of business is outside the United States, although we do not generally intend to invest in companies whose principal place of business is in an emerging market. Our portfolio composition may fluctuate from time to time based on market conditions and interest rates.\nCovenants are contractual restrictions that lenders place on companies to limit the corporate actions a company may pursue. Generally, the loans in which we expect to invest will have financial maintenance covenants, which are used to proactively address materially adverse changes in a portfolio company's financial performance. However, to a lesser extent, we may invest in covenant-lite\u201d loans. We use the term covenant-lite\u201d to refer generally to loans that do not have a complete set of financial maintenance covenants. Generally, covenant-lite\u201d loans provide borrower companies more freedom to negatively impact lenders because their covenants are incurrence-based, which means they are only tested and can only be breached following an affirmative action of the borrower, rather than by a deterioration in the borrower's financial condition. Accordingly, to the extent we invest in covenant-lite\u201d loans, we may have fewer rights against a borrower and may have a greater risk of loss on such investments as compared to investments in or exposure to loans with financial maintenance covenants.\nThe companies in which we invest use our capital to support their growth, acquisitions, market or product expansion, refinancings and/or recapitalizations. The debt in which we invest typically is not rated by any rating agency, but if these instruments were rated, they would likely receive a rating of below investment grade (that is, below BBB- or Baa3), which is often referred to as high yield\u201d or junk\u201d.\nKey Components of Our Results of Operations\nInvestments\nWe focus primarily on the direct origination of loans to middle market, technology-related companies domiciled in the United States.\nOur level of investment activity (both the number of investments and the size of each investment) can and will vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make.\nIn addition, as part of our risk strategy on investments, we may reduce the levels of certain investments through partial sales or syndication to additional lenders.\nRevenues\nWe generate revenues primarily in the form of interest income from the investments we hold. In addition, we may generate income from dividends on either direct equity investments or equity interests obtained in connection with originating loans, such as options, warrants or conversion rights. Our debt investments typically have a term of three to ten years. As of December 31, 2018, 89.0% of our debt investments based on fair value bear interest at a floating rate, subject to interest rate floors, in certain cases. Interest on our debt investments is generally payable either monthly or quarterly.\nOur investment portfolio consists primarily of floating rate loans. Macro trends in base interest rates like London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) may affect our net investment income over the long term. However, because we generally intend to originate loans to a small number of portfolio companies each quarter, and those investments may vary in size, our results in any given period, including the interest rate on investments that may be sold or repaid in a period compared to the interest rate of new investments made during that period, may be idiosyncratic, and reflect the characteristics of the particular portfolio companies that we invested in or exited during the period and not necessarily any trends in our business or macro trends.\nLoan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income using the effective yield method for term instruments and the straight-line method for revolving or delayed draw instruments. Repayments of our debt investments can reduce interest income from period to period. The frequency or volume of these repayments may fluctuate significantly. We record prepayment premiums on loans as interest income. We may also generate revenue in the form of commitment, loan origination, structuring, or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance to our portfolio companies and possibly consulting fees. Certain of these fees may be capitalized and amortized as additional interest income over the life of the related loan.\nDividend income on equity investments is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded companies.\nOur portfolio activity will also reflect the proceeds from sales of investments. We will recognize realized gains or losses on investments based on the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the amortized cost basis of the investment without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We record current period changes in fair value of investments that are measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized gains (losses) on investments in the consolidated statement of operations.\nExpenses\nOur primary operating expenses include the payment of the management fee, the incentive fee, and expenses reimbursable under the Administration Agreement and Investment Advisory Agreement. The management fee and incentive fee compensate our Adviser for work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, closing, monitoring and realizing our investments.\nExcept as specifically provided below, we anticipate that all investment professionals and staff of the Adviser, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory and management services to us, and the base compensation, bonus and benefits, and the routine overhead expenses, of such personnel allocable to such services, will be provided and paid for by the Adviser. In addition, the Adviser shall be solely responsible for any placement or finder's\u201d fees payable to placement agents engaged by the Company or its affiliates in connection with the offering of securities by the Company. We will bear our allocable portion of the costs of the compensation, benefits and related administrative expenses (including travel expenses) of our officers who provide operational and administrative services hereunder, their respective staffs and other professionals who provide services to us (including, in each case, employees of the Adviser or an affiliate) who assist with the preparation, coordination, and administration of the foregoing or provide other back office\u201d or middle office\u201d financial or operational services to us. We shall reimburse the Adviser (or its affiliates) for an allocable portion of the compensation paid by the Adviser (or its affiliates) to such individuals (based on a percentage of time such individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to our business affairs and in acting on our behalf). We also will bear all other costs and expenses of our operations, administration and transactions, including, but not limited to (i) investment advisory fees, including Management Fees and Incentive Fees, to the Adviser, pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement; (ii) our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Adviser in performing its administrative obligations under the Investment Advisory Agreement and (iii) all other expenses of our operations and transactions including, without limitation, those relating to:\n \u2022 the cost of our organization and any offerings; \n \u2022 the cost of calculating our net asset value, including the cost of any third-party valuation services; \n \u2022 the cost of effecting any sales and repurchases of the Common Stock and other securities; \n \u2022 fees and expenses payable under any dealer manager agreements, if any; \n \u2022 debt service and other costs of borrowings or other financing arrangements; \n \u2022 costs of hedging; \n \u2022 expenses, including travel expense, incurred by the Adviser, or members of the investment team, or payable to third parties, performing due diligence on prospective portfolio companies and, if necessary, enforcing our rights; \n \u2022 escrow agent, transfer agent and custodial fees and expenses; \n \u2022 fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts; \n \u2022 federal and state registration fees, any stock exchange listing fees and fees payable to rating agencies; \n \u2022 federal, state and local taxes; \n \u2022 independent directors' fees and expenses, including certain travel expenses; \n \u2022 costs of preparing financial statements and maintaining books and records and filing reports or other documents with the SEC (or other regulatory bodies) and other reporting and compliance costs, including registration fees, listing fees and licenses, and the compensation of professionals responsible for the preparation of the foregoing; \n \u2022 the costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to our shareholders (including printing and mailing costs); \n \u2022 the costs of any shareholder or director meetings and the compensation of personnel responsible for the preparation of the foregoing and related matters; \n \u2022 commissions and other compensation payable to brokers or dealers; \n \u2022 research and market data; \n \u2022 fidelity bond, directors and officers errors and omissions liability insurance and other insurance premiums; \n \u2022 direct costs and expenses of administration, including printing, mailing, long distance telephone and staff; \n \u2022 fees and expenses associated with independent audits, outside legal and consulting costs; \n \u2022 costs of winding up; \n \u2022 costs incurred in connection with the formation or maintenance of entities or vehicles to hold our assets for tax or other purposes; \n \u2022 extraordinary expenses (such as litigation or indemnification); and \n \u2022 costs associated with reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act and applicable federal and state securities laws. \nWe expect, but cannot ensure, that our general and administrative expenses will increase in dollar terms during periods of asset growth, but will decline as a percentage of total assets during such periods.\nLeverage\nThe amount of leverage we use in any period depends on a variety of factors, including cash available for investing, the cost of financing and general economic and market conditions. We generally will be permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to the common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, would at least be equal to 200% immediately after each such issuance. However, recent legislation has modified the 1940 Act by allowing a BDC to increase the maximum amount of leverage it may incur from an asset coverage ratio of 200% to an asset coverage ratio of 150%, if certain requirements are met. The reduced asset coverage requirement would permit a BDC to double the amount of leverage it can incur. For example, under a 150% asset coverage ratio the Company may borrow $2 for investment purposes of every $1 of investor equity whereas under a 200% asset coverage ratio the Company may only borrow $1 for investment purposes for every $1 of investor equity. On August 7, 2018, our Adviser, as our sole initial shareholder, has approved a proposal that allows us to reduce our asset coverage ratio to 150% and in connection with their subscription agreements, our investors are required to acknowledge our ability to operate with an asset coverage ratio that may be as low as 150%.\nIn any period, our interest expense will depend largely on the extent of our borrowing and we expect interest expense will increase as we increase our leverage over time subject to the limits of the 1940 Act. In addition, we may dedicate assets to financing facilities.\nMarket Trends\nWe believe the technology investment lending environment provides opportunities for us to meet our goal of making investments that generate an attractive total return based on a combination of the following factors:\nLimited Availability of Capital for Technology Companies. We believe that technology companies have limited access to capital, driven by a reduction in activity from commercial and investment banks, and a lack of dedicated pools of capital focused on\ntechnology companies. Traditional lenders, such as commercial and investment banks, generally do not have flexible product offerings that meet the needs of technology-related companies. In recent years, many commercial and investment banks have focused their efforts and resources on lending to large corporate clients and managing capital markets transactions rather than lending to technology-related companies. In addition, these lenders may be constrained in their ability to underwrite and hold loans and high yield securities, as well as their ability to provide equity financing, as they seek to meet existing and future regulatory capital requirements. We also believe that there is a lack of scaled market participants that are willing to provide and hold meaningful amounts of a customized financing solution for technology companies. As a result, we believe our focus on technology-related companies and our ability to invest across the capital structure, coupled with a limited supply of capital providers, presents an attractive opportunity to invest in technology companies.\nCapital Markets Have Been Unable to Fill the Void Left by Banks. While underwritten bond and syndicated loan markets have been robust in recent years, many technology companies are less able to access these markets for reasons including the following:\nHigh Yield Market - Many technology companies generally are not issuing debt in an amount large enough to be an attractively sized bond. High yield bonds are generally purchased by institutional investors who, among other things, are highly focused on the liquidity characteristics of the bond being issued. For example, mutual funds and exchange traded funds ( ETFs\u201d) are significant buyers of underwritten bonds. However, mutual funds and ETFs generally require the ability to liquidate their investments quickly in order to fund investor redemptions and/or comply with regulatory requirements. Accordingly, the existence of an active secondary market for bonds is an important consideration in these entities' initial investment decision. Because there is typically little or no active secondary market for the debt of U.S. middle market companies, mutual funds and ETFs generally do not provide debt capital to technology companies. We believe this is likely to be a persistent problem and creates an advantage for those like us who have a more stable capital base and have the ability to invest in illiquid assets.\nSyndicated Loan Market - Loan issue size and liquidity are key drivers of institutional appetite and, correspondingly, underwriters' willingness to underwrite the loans. Loans arranged through a bank are done either on a best efforts\u201d basis or are underwritten with terms plus provisions that permit the underwriters to change certain terms, including pricing, structure, yield and\ntenor, otherwise known as flex\u201d, to successfully syndicate the loan, in the event the terms initially marketed are insufficiently attractive to investors. Loans provided by companies such as ours provide certainty to issuers in that we can commit to a given amount of debt on specific terms, at stated coupons and with agreed upon fees. As we are the ultimate holder of the loans, we do not require market flex\u201d or other arrangements that banks may require when acting on an agency basis.\nRobust Demand for Debt Capital. According to S&P Capital IQ, there was approximately $1.2 trillion of mergers and acquisitions activity in the technology and software industries from 2013 through 2017. We believe technology companies will continue to require access to capital to refinance existing debt, support growth and finance acquisitions. In addition, we believe the large amount of uninvested capital held by funds of private equity firms, estimated by Preqin Ltd., an alternative assets industry data and research company, to be $1.2 trillion as of December 2018, coupled with a growing focus on technology investing by private equity sponsors, will continue to drive deal activity. We expect that technology companies, private equity sponsors, venture capital firms, and entrepreneurs will continue to seek partners to provide flexible financing for their businesses with debt and equity investments provided by companies such as us.\nTechnology Spend is Large and Increasing. According to Gartner, a research and advisory company, global technology spend was $3.5 trillion in 2017 and is expected to grow to more than $4.0 trillion by 2021. We believe global demand for technology products and services will continue to grow rapidly, and that that growth will stimulate demand for capital from technology companies.\nAttractive Investment Dynamics. An imbalance between the supply of, and demand for, capital creates attractive pricing dynamics. With respect to the debt investments in technology companies, we believe the directly negotiated nature of such financings generally provides more favorable terms to the lender, including stronger covenant and reporting packages, better call protection, and lender protective change of control provisions. Further, we believe that historical default rates for technology and software companies have been lower, and recovery rates have been higher, as compared to the broader leveraged finance market, leading to lower cumulative losses. With respect to equity and equity-linked investments, we will seek to structure these investments with meaningful shareholder protections, including, but not limited to, anti-dilution, anti-layering, and liquidation preferences, which we believe will create the potential for meaningful risk-adjusted long-term capital gains in connection with the future liquidity events of these technology companies.\nCompelling Business Models. We believe that the products and services that technology companies provide often have high switching costs and are fundamental to the operations and success of their customers. As a result, technology companies have attributes that make them compelling investments, including strong customer retention rates, and highly recurring and predictable revenue. Further, technology companies are typically highly capital efficient, with limited capital expenditures and high free cash flow conversion.\nAttractive Opportunities in Investments in Technology Companies. We invest in the debt and equity of technology companies. We believe that opportunities in the debt of technology companies are significant because of the floating rate structure of most senior secured debt issuances and because of the strong defensive characteristics of these types of investments. Given the current low interest rate environment, we believe that debt issues with floating interest rates offer a superior return profile as compared with fixed-rate investments, since floating rate structures are generally less susceptible to declines in value experienced by fixed-rate securities in a rising interest rate environment. Senior secured debt also provides strong defensive characteristics. Senior secured debt has priority in payment among an issuer's security holders whereby holders are due to receive payment before junior creditors and equity holders. Further, these investments are generally secured by the issuer's assets, which may provide protection in the event of a default.\nWe believe that opportunities in the equity of technology companies are significant because of the potential to generate meaningful capital appreciation by participating in the growth in the portfolio company and the demand for its products and services. Moreover, we believe that the high-growth profile of a technology company will generally make it a more attractive candidate for a liquidity event than a company in a non-high growth industry.\nPortfolio and Investment Activity\nAs of December 31, 2018, based on fair value, our portfolio consisted of 81.6% first lien senior secured debt investments, 7.4% second lien senior secured debt investments and 11.0% unsecured debt investments.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our weighted average total yield of the portfolio at fair value and amortized cost was 8.0% and 8.0%, respectively, and our weighted average yield of debt and income producing securities at fair value and amortized cost was 8.0% and 8.0%, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2018 we had investments in six portfolio companies with an aggregate fair value of $262.8 million.\nOur investment activity for the period ended December 31, 2018 is presented below (information presented herein is at par value unless otherwise indicated).\n \n\n________________\n (1) Number of new investment commitments represents commitments to a particular portfolio company. \n (2) Assumes each floating rate commitment is subject to the greater of the interest rate floor (if applicable) or 3-month LIBOR, which was 2.81% as of December 31, 2018. \nAs of December 31, 2018, our investments consisted of the following:\n\nThe table below describes investments by industry composition based on fair value as of December 31, 2018:\n\nThe table below describes investments by geographic composition based on fair value as of December 31, 2018:\n\nThe weighted average yields and interest rates of our investments at fair value as of December 31, 2018 were as follows:\n\nThe weighted average yield of our debt and income producing securities is not the same as a return on investment for our shareholders but, rather, relates to a portion of our investment portfolio and is calculated before the payment of all of our and our subsidiaries' fees and expenses. The weighted average yield was computed using the effective interest rates as of each respective date, including accretion of original issue discount and loan origination fees, but excluding investments on non-accrual status, if any. There can be no assurance that the weighted average yield will remain at its current level.\nOur Adviser monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. It monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if they are meeting their respective business plans and to assess the appropriate course of action with respect to each portfolio company. Our Adviser has several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which may include the following:\n \u2022 assessment of success of the portfolio company in adhering to its business plan and compliance with covenants; \n \u2022 periodic and regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor, to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments; \n \u2022 comparisons to other companies in the portfolio company's industry; and \n \u2022 review of monthly or quarterly financial statements and financial projections for portfolio companies. \nAs part of the monitoring process, our Adviser employs an investment rating system to categorize our investments. In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, our Adviser rates the credit risk of all investments on a scale of 1 to 5. This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio investment relative to our initial cost basis in respect of such portfolio investment (i.e., at the time of origination or acquisition), although it may also take into account the performance of the portfolio company's business, the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors. The rating system is as follows:\n Investment Rating Description Investments with a rating of 1 involve the least amount of risk to our initial cost basis. The borrower is performing above expectations, and the trends and risk factors for this investment since origination or acquisition are generally favorable; Investments rated 2 involve an acceptable level of risk that is similar to the risk at the time of origination or acquisition. The borrower is generally performing as expected and the risk factors are neutral to favorable. All investments or acquired investments in new portfolio companies are initially assessed a rate of 2; Investments rated 3 involve a borrower performing below expectations and indicates that the loan's risk has increased somewhat since origination or acquisition; \n Investments rated 4 involve a borrower performing materially below expectations and indicates that the loan's risk has increased materially since origination or acquisition. In addition to the borrower being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, loan payments may be past due (but generally not more than 120 days past due); and Investments rated 5 involve a borrower performing substantially below expectations and indicates that the loan's risk has increased substantially since origination or acquisition. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. Loans rated 5 are not anticipated to be repaid in full and we will reduce the fair value of the loan to the amount we anticipate will be recovered. \nOur Adviser rates the investments in our portfolio at least quarterly and it is possible that the rating of a portfolio investment may be reduced or increased over time. For investments rated 3, 4 or 5, our Adviser enhances its level of scrutiny over the monitoring of such portfolio company.\nThe following table shows the composition of our portfolio on the 1 to 5 rating scale as of December 31, 2018:\n\nThe following table shows the amortized cost of our performing and non-accrual debt investments as of December 31, 2018:\n\nLoans are generally placed on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Accrued interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management's judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid current and, in management's judgment, are likely to remain current. Management may make exceptions to this treatment and determine to not place a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table represents the operating results for the period ended December 31, 2018:\n\nNet increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations can vary from period to period as a result of various factors, including the level of new investment commitments, expenses, the recognition of realized gains and losses and changes in unrealized appreciation and depreciation on the investment portfolio. Additionally, we were initially capitalized on August 7, 2018 and commenced investing activities in September 2018. As a result, comparisons may not be meaningful.\nInvestment Income\nInvestment income for the period ended December 31, 2018 were as follows:\n\nWe generate revenues primarily in the form of interest income from the investments we hold. In addition, we may generate income from dividends on either direct equity investments or equity interests obtained in connection with originating loans, such as options, warrants or conversion rights.\nExpenses\nExpenses for the period ended December 31, 2018 were as follows:\n\nUnder the terms of the Administration Agreement, we reimburse the Adviser for services performed for us. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Administration Agreement, the Adviser may delegate its obligations under the Administration Agreement to an affiliate or to a third party and we reimburse the Adviser for any services performed for us by such affiliate or third party.\nIncome Taxes, Including Excise Taxes\nWe intend to elect to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, and we intend to operate in a manner so as to continue to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify for tax treatment as a RIC, we must, among other things, distribute to our shareholders in each taxable year generally at least 90% of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, and net tax-exempt income for that taxable year. To maintain our tax treatment as a RIC, we, among other things, intend to make the requisite distributions to our shareholders, which generally relieves us from corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes.\nDepending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we can be expected to carry forward taxable income (including net capital gains, if any) in excess of current year dividend distributions from the current tax year into the next tax year and pay a nondeductible 4% U.S. federal excise tax on such taxable income, as required. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions from such income, we will accrue excise tax on estimated excess taxable income.\nFor the period ended December 31, 2018 we did not accrue U.S. federal excise tax.\nNet Change in Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Investments\nWe fair value our portfolio investments quarterly and any changes in fair value are recorded as unrealized gains or losses. During the period ended December 31, 2018, net unrealized gains (losses) on our investment portfolio were comprised of the following:\n\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOur liquidity and capital resources are generated primarily from the proceeds of capital drawdowns of our privately placed Capital Commitments, cash flows from interest, dividends and fees earned from our investments and principal repayments, and our credit facilities. The primary uses of our cash are (i) investments in portfolio companies and other investments and to comply with certain portfolio diversification requirements, (ii) the cost of operations (including paying our Adviser) and (iii) cash distributions to the holders of our shares.\nWe may from time to time enter into additional debt facilities, increase the size of our existing credit facilities or issue additional debt securities. Any such incurrence or issuance would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. In accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to incur borrowings, issue debt securities or issue preferred stock, if immediately after the borrowing or issuance, the ratio of total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness) to total indebtedness plus preferred stock, is at least 150%. As of December 31, 2018, our asset coverage ratio was 195%. We seek to carefully consider our unfunded commitments for the purpose of planning our ongoing financial leverage. Further, we maintain sufficient borrowing capacity within the 150% asset coverage limitation to cover any outstanding unfunded commitments we are required to fund.\nCash as of December 31, 2018, taken together with our uncalled Capital Commitments of $1.5 billion and available debt capacity of $50.0 million, is expected to be sufficient for our investing activities and to conduct our operations in the near term.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $323.0 million in cash. During the period ended December 31, 2018, we used $263.5 million in cash for operating activities, primarily as a result of funding portfolio investments of $262.8 million, partially offset by other operating activity of $0.7 million. Lastly, cash provided by financing activities was $586.6 million during the period, which was the result of proceeds from the issuance of shares, net of offering costs paid, of $289.0 million and proceeds from net borrowing on our credit facilities, net of debt issuance costs, of $297.6 million.\nEquity\nSubscriptions and Drawdowns\nIn connection with our formation, we have the authority to issue 500,000,000 common shares at $0.01 per share par value.\nOn August 7, 2018, we issued 100 common shares for $1,500 to Owl Rock Technology Advisors LLC, which subsequently became our Adviser on August 10, 2018.\nWe have entered into subscription agreements (the Subscription Agreements\u201d) with investors providing for the private placement of our common shares. Under the terms of the Subscription Agreements, investors are required to fund drawdowns to purchase our common shares up to the amount of their respective Capital Commitment on an as-needed basis each time we deliver a capital call notice to its investors.\nDuring the period ended December 31, 2018, we delivered the following capital call notices to investors:\n\nDistributions\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we did not declare any distributions on shares of our common stock. On February 27, 2019, our Board declared a distribution of 90% of estimated first quarter taxable income and net capital gains, if any, for shareholders of record on March 31, 2019, payable on or before May 15, 2019.\nDividend Reinvestment\nWith respect to distributions, we adopted an opt out\u201d dividend reinvestment plan for common shareholders. As a result, in the event of a declared distribution, each shareholder that has not opted out\u201d of the dividend reinvestment plan will have their dividends or distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock rather than receiving cash distributions. Shareholders who receive distributions in the form of shares of common stock will be subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash distributions.\nDebt\nAggregate Borrowings\nDebt obligations consisted of the following as of December 31, 2018:\n\n________________\n (1) The amount available reflects any limitations related to each credit facility's borrowing base. \n (2) The carrying value of our Subscription Credit Facility is presented net of debt issuance costs of $2.4 million. \nFor the period ended December 31, 2018, the components of interest expense were as follows:\n\n________________\n (1) Average reflects the period from November 19, 2018, the date of the agreement, through December 31, 2018. \nSubscription Credit Facility\nOn November 19, 2018 (the Closing Date\u201d), Owl Rock Technology Finance Corp. (the Company\u201d) entered into a revolving credit facility (the Subscription Credit Facility\u201d) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ( Wells Fargo\u201d) as administrative agent (the Administrative Agent\u201d), and Wells Fargo, PNC Bank, National Association ( PNC\u201d), and State Street Bank and Trust\nCompany ( State Street\u201d), as lenders, with a maximum principal amount of the Subscription Credit Facility of $350 million, subject to availability under the borrowing base, which is based on unused capital commitments.\nOn February 25, 2019, the maximum principal amount of the Subscription Credit Facility was increased to $450 million, subject to availability under the borrowing base, which is based on unused capital commitments. The maximum principal amount of the Subscription Credit Facility may be further increased upon request of the Company up to $700 million, subject to customary conditions, and the Subscription Credit Facility also includes a provision permitting the Company to further increase the size of the Subscription Credit Facility under certain circumstances up to a maximum principal amount not to exceed $1 billion, if the existing or new lenders agree to commit to such further increase. Borrowings under the Subscription Credit Facility bear interest, at the Company's election at the time of drawdown, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of LIBOR rate loans, an adjusted LIBOR rate for the applicable interest period plus 1.50% or (ii) in the case of reference rate loans, the greatest of (A) a prime rate plus 0.50%, (B) the federal funds rate plus 1.00%, and (C) one-month LIBOR plus 1.50%. Loans may be converted from one rate to another at any time at the Company's election, subject to certain conditions. The Company also will pay an unused commitment fee of 0.25% per annum on the unused commitments.\nThe Subscription Credit Facility will mature upon the earliest of: (i) the date three (3) years from the Closing Date (the Stated Maturity Date\u201d); (ii) the date upon which the Administrative Agent declares the obligations under the Subscription Credit Facility due and payable after the occurrence of an event of default; (iii) forty-five (45) days prior to the scheduled termination of the commitment period under the Company's subscription agreements; (iv) forty-five (45) days prior to the date of any listing of the Company's common stock on a national securities exchange; (v) the termination of the commitment period under the Company's subscription agreements (if earlier than the scheduled date); and (vi) the date the Company terminates the commitments pursuant to the Subscription Credit Facility. At the Company's option, the Stated Maturity Date may be extended by up to 364 days, subject to satisfaction of customary conditions.\nThe Subscription Credit Facility is secured by a perfected first priority security interest in the Company's right, title, and interest in and to the capital commitments of the Company's private investors, including the Company's right to make capital calls, receive and apply capital contributions, enforce remedies and claims related thereto together with capital call proceeds and related rights, and a pledge of the collateral account into which capital call proceeds are deposited.\nThe Subscription Credit Facility contains customary covenants, including certain limitations on the incurrence by us of additional indebtedness and on our ability to make distributions to our shareholders, or redeem, repurchase or retire shares of stock, upon the occurrence of certain events, and customary events of default (with customary cure and notice provisions).\nTransfers of interests in the Company by investors must comply with certain sections of the Subscription Credit Facility and we shall notify the Administrative Agent before such transfers take place. Such transfers may trigger mandatory prepayment obligations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nPortfolio Company Commitments\nFrom time to time, we may enter into commitments to fund investments. As of December 31, 2018, we had the following outstanding commitments to fund investments in current portfolio companies:\n\nThe Company maintains sufficient capacity to cover outstanding unfunded portfolio company commitments that the Company may be required to fund.\nInvestor Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $1.8 billion in total Capital Commitments from our investors ($1.5 billion undrawn), of which $65.0 million is from an affiliate of our Adviser ($58.4 million undrawn). These undrawn Capital Commitments will no longer remain in effect following the completion of an initial public offering of our common stock.\nOther Commitments and Contingencies\nFrom time to time, we may become a party to certain legal proceedings incidental to the normal course of its business. At December 31, 2018, management was not aware of any pending or threatened litigation.\nRelated-Party Transactions\nWe have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following:\n \u2022 the Investment Advisory Agreement; \n \u2022 the Administration Agreement; \n \u2022 the Dealer Manager Agreement; \n \u2022 the Placement Agent Agreement; and \n \u2022 the License Agreement. \nIn addition to the aforementioned agreements, we intend to rely on exemptive relief that has been granted to ORCA and certain of its affiliates to permit us to co-invest with other funds managed by our Adviser or certain of its affiliates including Owl Rock Capital Corporation and Owl Rock Capital Corporation II in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. See ITEM 1. - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 3. Agreements and Related Party Transactions\u201d for further details.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. Our critical accounting policies should be read in connection with our risk factors as described in ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\u201d\nInvestments at Fair Value\nInvestment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds received (excluding prepayment fees, if any) and the amortized cost basis of the investment using the specific identification method without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized, and include investments charged off during the period, net of recoveries. The net change in unrealized gains or losses primarily reflects the change in investment values, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains or losses with respect to investments realized during the period.\nInvestments for which market quotations are readily available are typically valued at the bid price of those market quotations. To validate market quotations, we utilize a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and number of the quotations. Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available, as is the case for substantially all of our investments, are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board, based on, among other things, the input of the Adviser, our audit committee and independent third-party valuation firm(s) engaged at the direction of the Board.\nAs part of the valuation process, the Board takes into account relevant factors in determining the fair value of our investments, including: the estimated enterprise value of a portfolio company (i.e., the total fair value of the portfolio company's debt and equity), the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments based on its earnings and cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, a comparison of the portfolio company's securities to any similar publicly traded securities, and overall changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets that may affect the price at which similar investments may be made in the future. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, the Board considers whether the pricing indicated by the external event corroborates its valuation.\nThe Board undertakes a multi-step valuation process, which includes, among other procedures, the following:\n \u2022 With respect to investments for which market quotations are readily available, those investments will typically be valued at the bid price of those market quotations; \n \u2022 With respect to investment for which market quotations are not readily available, the valuation process begins with the independent valuation firm(s) providing a preliminary valuation of each investment to the Adviser's valuation committee; \n \u2022 Preliminary valuation conclusions are documented and discussed with the Adviser's valuation committee. Agreed upon valuation recommendations are presented to the Audit Committee; \n \u2022 The Audit Committee reviews the valuations recommendations and recommends values for each investment to the Board; and \n \u2022 The Board reviews the recommended valuations and determines the fair value of each investment. \nWe conduct this valuation process on a quarterly basis.\nWe apply Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 820, Fair Value Measurements ( ASC 820\u201d), as amended, which establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP and required disclosures of fair value measurements. ASC 820 determines fair value to be the price that would be received for an investment in a current sale, which assumes an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market (which may be a hypothetical market) that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. In accordance with ASC 820, we consider its principal market to be the market that has the greatest volume and level of activity. ASC 820 specifies a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes and ranks the level of observability of inputs used in determination of fair value. In accordance with ASC 820, these levels are summarized below:\n \u2022 Level 1 - Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access. \n \u2022 Level 2 - Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. \n \u2022 Level 3 - Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. \nTransfers between levels, if any, are recognized at the beginning of the quarter in which the transfer occurred. In addition to using the above inputs in investment valuations, we apply the valuation policy approved by our Board that is consistent with ASC 820. Consistent with the valuation policy, we evaluate the source of the inputs, including any markets in which our investments are trading (or any markets in which securities with similar attributes are trading), in determining fair value. When an investment is valued based on prices provided by reputable dealers or pricing services (that is, broker quotes), we subject those prices to various criteria in making the determination as to whether a particular investment would qualify for treatment as a Level 2 or Level 3 investment. For example, we, or the independent valuation firm(s), review pricing support provided by dealers or pricing services in order to determine if observable market information is being used, versus unobservable inputs.\nDue to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of such investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that may ultimately be realized. Further, such investments are generally less liquid than publicly traded securities and may be subject to contractual and other restrictions on resale. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, it could realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material.\nIn addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected herein.\nInterest and Dividend Income Recognition\nInterest income is recorded on the accrual basis and includes amortization of discounts or premiums. Discounts and premiums to par value on securities purchased are amortized into interest income over the contractual life of the respective security using the effective yield method. The amortized cost of investments represents the original cost adjusted for the amortization of discounts or premiums, if any. Upon prepayment of a loan or debt security, any prepayment premiums, unamortized upfront loan origination fees and unamortized discounts are recorded as interest income in the current period.\nLoans are generally placed on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Accrued interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management's judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual\nloans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid current and, in management's judgment, are likely to remain current. Management may make exceptions to this treatment and determine to not place a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.\nDividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly-traded portfolio companies.\nDistributions\nWe intend to elect to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and qualify annually thereafter, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. To obtain and maintain our tax treatment as a RIC, we must distribute (or be deemed to distribute) in each taxable year distribution for tax purposes equal to at least 90 percent of the sum of our:\n \u2022 investment company taxable income (which is generally our ordinary income plus the excess of realized short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid, for such taxable year; and \n \u2022 net tax-exempt interest income (which is the excess of our gross tax-exempt interest income over certain disallowed deductions) for such taxable year. \nAs a RIC, we (but not our shareholders) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal tax on investment company taxable income and net capital gains that we distribute to our shareholders.\nWe intend to distribute annually all or substantially all of such income. To the extent that we retain our net capital gains or any investment company taxable income, we generally will be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax. We can be expected to carry forward our net capital gains or any investment company taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions, and pay the U.S. federal excise tax as described below.\nAmounts not distributed on a timely basis in accordance with a calendar year distribution requirement are subject to a nondeductible 4% U.S. federal excise tax payable by us. We may be subject to a nondeductible 4% U.S. federal excise tax if we do not distribute (or are treated as distributing) during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of:\n \u2022 98% of our net ordinary income excluding certain ordinary gains or losses for that calendar year; \n \u2022 98.2% of our capital gain net income, adjusted for certain ordinary gains and losses, recognized for the twelve-month period ending on October 31 of that calendar year; and \n \u2022 100% of any income or gains recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years. \nWhile we intend to distribute any income and capital gains in the manner necessary to minimize imposition of the 4% U.S. federal excise tax, sufficient amounts of our taxable income and capital gains may not be distributed and as a result, in such cases, the excise tax will be imposed. In such an event, we will be liable for this tax only on the amount by which we do not meet the foregoing distribution requirement.\nWe intend to pay quarterly distributions to our shareholders out of assets legally available for distribution. All distributions will be paid at the discretion of our Board and will depend on our earnings, financial condition, maintenance of our tax treatment as a RIC, compliance with applicable BDC regulations and such other factors as our Board may deem relevant from time to time.\nTo the extent our current taxable earnings for a year fall below the total amount of our distributions for that year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, the source of a distribution to our shareholders may be the original capital invested by the shareholder rather than our income or gains. Shareholders should read written disclosure carefully and should not assume that the source of any distribution is our ordinary income or gains.\nWe have adopted an opt out\u201d dividend reinvestment plan for our common shareholders. As a result, if we declare a cash dividend or other distribution, each shareholder that has not opted out\u201d of our dividend reinvestment plan will have their dividends or distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock rather than receiving cash distributions. Shareholders who receive distributions in the form of shares of common stock will be subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash distributions.\nIncome Taxes\nWe have elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We also intend to elect to be treated as a RIC under the Code beginning with its taxable period ending December 31, 2018. So long as we maintain our tax treatment as a RIC, we generally will not pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute at least annually to our shareholders as dividends. Instead, any tax liability related to income earned and distributed by us represents obligations of our investors and will not be reflected in our consolidated financial statements.\nTo qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. In addition, to qualify for RIC tax treatment, we must distribute to its shareholders, for each taxable year, at least 90% of our investment company taxable income\u201d for that year, which is generally our ordinary income plus the excess of our realized net short-term capital gains over our realized net long-term capital losses. In order for us not to be subject to U.S. federal excise taxes, we must distribute annually an amount at least equal to the sum of (i) 98% of our net ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for the calendar year, (ii) 98.2% of our capital gains in excess of capital losses for the one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year and (iii) any net ordinary income and capital gains in excess of capital losses for preceding years that were not distributed during such years. We, at our discretion, may carry forward taxable income in excess of calendar year dividends and pay a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on this income.\nWe do not currently qualify as a publicly offered regulated investment company,\u201d as defined in the Code. Accordingly, shareholders may be taxed as though they received a distribution of some of our expenses. A publicly offered regulated investment company\u201d is a RIC whose shares are either (i) continuously offered pursuant to a public offering, (ii) regularly traded on an established securities market, or (iii) held by at least 500 persons at all times during the taxable year. The Company cannot determine when it will qualify as a publicly offered RIC. If we do not qualify as a publicly offered RIC during the tax year, a non-corporate shareholder's allocable portion of our affected expenses, including a portion of its management fees, will be treated as an additional distribution to shareholders. A non-corporate shareholder's allocable portion of these expenses are treated as miscellaneous itemized deductions that are not currently deductible by such shareholders.\nWe evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing our consolidated financial statements to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not\u201d to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not\u201d threshold are reserved and recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. All penalties and interest associated with income taxes are included in income tax expense. Conclusions regarding tax positions are subject to review and may be adjusted at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, on-going analyses of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. There were no material uncertain tax positions through December 31, 2018.", "item_7_tables": "Table 183: <table> <tr> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Period from July 12, 2018

Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) for Owl Rock Technology Finance Corp. It provides an overview of the company's financial conditions and results from operations and should be read in conjunction with Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements found earlier in the report.\n\nOwl Rock Technology Finance Corp., a Maryland corporation, invests primarily in technology-related companies within the United States. It generates revenue through debt investments (senior secured or unsecured loans, subordinated loans, or mezzanine loans) and equity-related securities (including common equity, warrants, preferred stock, and possibly convertible senior equity). The company seeks to maximize total return through current income from debt investments and capital appreciation from equity and equity-linked investments.\n\nManagement of the company is conducted by Owl Rock Technology Advisors LLC, which is registered with the SEC as an investment adviser. Owl Rock Technology Finance Corp. also engages in private offerings of its common shares to accredited investors. As of December 31, 2018, it had $1.8 billion in total Capital Commitments from investors, with $65.0 million from entities affiliated with its Adviser.\n\nThe company's investments were primarily in industries like IT, software, financial services, health technology, and other sectors and had a portfolio consisting mainly of first lien senior secured debt investments. Investment activity totaled $332 million in new commitments during the reporting period, and investing activity has seen $11.1 billion in originated investments across different industries by the company\u2019s Adviser or its affiliates since April 2016.\n\nThe company has secured a revolving credit facility for $350 million with credit institutions and may enter or increase facilities or issue debt securities, considering market conditions and needs. For the period ending December 31, 2018, the total investment income was $2.6 million, less $4.7 million in expenses, resulting in a net investment loss of $2.1 million and an overall net decrease in net assets resulting from operations of $3.2 million.\n\nOwl Rock Technology Finance Corp. is regulated as a Business Development Company (BDC) under the 1940 Act and aims to elect a status as a regulated investment company (RIC) for tax purposes. This would enable the company, by meeting specific requirements, to pass its taxable income directly to shareholders without corporate-level federal income tax.\n\nThe MD&A details the company's accounting policies, particularly concerning the valuation of investments and income recognition. It emphasizes the importance of fair value measurements for investments where market quotations are not readily available. The company uses a third-party valuation firm to assist its Board in determining the fair value of such investments.\n\nFinally, the report outlines related-party transactions, including various agreements with affiliates, and states Owl Rock Technology Finance Corp.'s policy on the distribution of income to maintain its RIC tax status. The company intends to distribute dividends quarterly and has adopted an \"opt-out\" dividend reinvestment plan for shareholders who choose to automatically reinvest dividends into additional shares instead of receiving cash distributions."}
