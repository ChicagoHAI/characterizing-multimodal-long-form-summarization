Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those under Risk Factors\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A or in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nEverbridge is a global software company that provides enterprise software applications that automate and accelerate organizations' operational response to critical events in order to keep people safe and businesses running. During public safety threats such as active shooter situations, terrorist attacks or severe weather conditions, as well as critical business events such as IT outages, cyber-attacks or other incidents such as product recalls or supply-chain interruptions, our SaaS-based platform enables our customers to quickly and reliably aggregate and assess threat data, locate people at risk and responders able to assist, automate the execution of pre-defined communications processes and track progress on executing response plans. Our customers use our platform to identify and assess hundreds of different types of threats to their organizations, people, assets or brand. Our solutions enable organizations to deliver intelligent, contextual messages to, and receive verification of delivery from, hundreds or millions of recipients, across multiple communications modalities such as voice, SMS and e-mail. Our applications enable the delivery of messages in near real-time to more than 100 different communication devices, in over 200 countries and territories, in 15 languages and dialects - all simultaneously. We delivered 1.5 billion communications in 2016. We automate the process of sending contextual notifications to multiple constituencies and receiving return information on a person's or operation's status so that organizations can act quickly and precisely. Our Critical Event Management platform is comprised of a comprehensive set of software applications that address the full spectrum of tasks an organization has to perform to manage a critical event, including Mass Notification, Incident Management, Safety Connection, IT Alerting, Visual Command Center, Crisis Commander, Community Engagement and Secure Messaging. We believe that our broad suite of integrated, enterprise applications delivered via a single global platform is a significant competitive advantage in the market for Critical Event Management solutions, which we refer to generally as CEM.\nOur customer base has grown from 867 customers at the end of 2011 to more than 3,200 customers as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, our customers were based in 28 countries and included eight of the 10 largest U.S. cities, eight of the 10 largest U.S.-based investment banks, 24 of the 25 busiest North American airports, six of the 10 largest global consulting firms, six of the 10 largest global auto makers, all four of the largest global accounting firms, four of the 10 largest U.S.-based health care providers and four of the 10 largest U.S.-based health insurers. We provide our applications to customers of varying sizes, including enterprises, small businesses, non-profit organizations, educational institutions and governmental agencies. Our customers span a wide variety of industries including technology, energy, financial services, healthcare and life sciences, manufacturing, media and entertainment, retail, higher education and professional services.\nWe sell all of our critical communications applications on a subscription basis. We generally enter into contracts that range from one to three years in length, with an average contract duration of 2.0 years as of December 31, 2016, and generally bill and collect payment annually in advance. We derive most of our revenue from subscriptions to applications. Over 90% of the revenue that we recognized in each of the eight most recently completed quarters was generated from contracts entered into in prior quarters or renewals of those contracts; the balance of the revenue that we recognized in each such quarter was generated from contracts entered into with new customers or new contracts, other than renewals, entered into with existing customers in such quarter. Historically, we derived more than 86% of our revenue in each of the last three fiscal years from sales of our Mass Notification application. Our pricing model is based on the number of applications subscribed to and, per application, the number of people, locations and things connected to our platform as well as the volume of communications. We also offer premium services including data feeds for social media, threat intelligence and weather. We generate additional revenue by expanding the number of applications that our customers subscribe to and the number of contacts and devices connected to our platform.\nWe generated revenue of $76.8 million in 2016, $58.7 million in 2015, $42.4 million in 2014 and $30.0 million in 2013, representing year-over-year increases of 41% in 2014, 38% in 2015 and 31% in 2016. We had net losses of $11.3 million, $10.8 million, $0.6 million and $0.9 million in 2016, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, 14% and 17% of our customers, respectively, were located outside of the United States and these customers generated 10% and 14% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nWe have focused on rapidly growing our business and believe that the future growth of our business is dependent on many factors, including our ability to increase the functionality of our platform and applications, expand our customer base, accelerate adoption of our applications beyond Mass Notification within our existing customer base and expand our international presence. Our future growth will also depend on the growth in the market for critical communications solutions and our ability to effectively compete. In order to further penetrate the market for critical communications solutions and capitalize on what we believe to be a significant opportunity, we intend to continue to invest in research and development, build-out our data center infrastructure and services capabilities and hire additional sales representatives, both domestically and internationally, to drive sales to new customers and incremental sales of new applications to existing customers. Nevertheless, we expect to continue to incur losses in the near term and, if we are unable to achieve our growth objectives, we may not be able to achieve profitability.\nRecent Developments\nIn September 2016, we closed our initial public offering, or IPO, at which time we sold a total of 6,250,000 shares of our common stock. We received net cash proceeds of $66.1 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and other costs associated with the offering paid or payable by us.\nIn December 2016, we acquired 100% of the shares of Svensk Krisledning AB, or Crisis Commander. We acquired Crisis Commander for cash consideration of approximately $2.3 million with additional time and performance-based milestones that could result in additional payments of $0.4 million. Crisis Commander is a SaaS mobile crisis management company operating out of Sweden.\nIn January 2017, we acquired 100% of the shares of IDV Solutions, LLC, or IDV. We acquired IDV for cash consideration of approximately $21.3 million, with additional time and performance-based milestones that could result in additional payments of $6.2 million. IDV is a provider of threat assessment and operational visualization software located in Lansing, Michigan.\nPresentation of Financial Statements\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Business acquisitions are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition. Our purchase accounting resulted in all assets and liabilities of acquired businesses being recorded at their estimated fair values on the acquisition dates. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nWe report our financial results as one operating segment. Our operating results are regularly reviewed on a consolidated basis by our chief executive officer, who is our chief operating decision maker, principally to make strategic decisions regarding how we allocate our resources and to assess our consolidated operating performance.\nOther Metrics\nWe regularly monitor a number of financial and operating metrics in order to measure our current performance and estimate our future performance. Our other business metrics may be calculated in a manner different than similar other business metrics used by other companies.\nTable 201: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue retention rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,351\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,524\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted gross margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 55,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 41,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 30,663\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Free cash flow\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,953\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 202: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Revenue Retention Rate. We calculate our revenue retention rate by dividing (1) total revenue in the current 12-month period from those customers who were customers during the prior 12-month period by (2) total revenue from all customers in the prior 12-month period. For the purposes of calculating our revenue retention rate, we count as customers all entities with whom we had contracts in the applicable period other than (1) customers of our wholly-owned subsidiary, Microtech, which generates an immaterial amount of our revenue in any given year and (2) in the first year following our acquisition of another business, customers that we acquired in connection with such acquisition. We believe that our ability to retain our customers and expand their use of our solutions over time is an indicator of the stability of our revenue base and the long-term value of our customer relationships. Our revenue retention rate provides insight into the impact on current period revenue of the number of new customers acquired during the prior 12-month period, the timing of our implementation of those new customers, growth in the usage of our solutions by our existing customers and customer attrition. If our revenue retention rate for a period exceeds 100%, this means that the revenue retained during the period including upsells more than offset the revenue that we lost from customers that did not renew their contracts during the period. Our revenue retention rate may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customers' satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our platform and applications, pricing, economic conditions or overall reductions in our customers' spending levels.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 203: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA represents our net loss before interest income and interest expense, income tax expense and benefit, depreciation and amortization expense and stock-based compensation expense. We do not consider these items to be indicative of our core operating performance. The items that are non-cash include depreciation and amortization expense and stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA is a measure used by management to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends and to generate future operating plans, make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital and invest in initiatives that are focused on cultivating new markets for our solutions. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating adjusted EBITDA facilitates comparisons of our operating performance on a period-to-period basis. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors. Nevertheless, use of adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: (1) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the capitalized software that is amortized will need to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; (2) adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (3) adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation; (4) adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments or receipts that may represent a reduction or increase in cash available to us; and (5) other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces the usefulness of the metric as a comparative measure. Because of these and other limitations, you should consider adjusted EBITDA alongside our other GAAP-based financial performance measures, net loss and our other GAAP financial results.

Adjusted gross margin represents gross profit plus stock-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangibles. Adjusted gross margin is a measure used by management to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends and to generate future operating plans. The exclusion of stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquired intangibles facilitates comparisons of our operating performance on a period-to-period basis. In the near term, we expect these expenses to continue to negatively impact our gross profit. Adjusted gross margin is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.

These non-GAAP financial measures exclude all or a combination of the following (as reflected in the following reconciliation tables): stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquired intangibles. The presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making purposes and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about our operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects and allow for greater transparency with respect to metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision making. While our non-GAAP financial measures are an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating our own operating results over different periods of time, you should consider our non-GAAP financial measures alongside our GAAP financial results.\nWe exclude stock-based compensation expense because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of equity instruments that can impact our non-cash expense. We believe that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation expense allow for more meaningful comparisons between our operating results from period to period. We believe that excluding the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles allows for more meaningful comparisons between operating results from period to period as the intangibles are valued at the time of acquisition and are amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition. Accordingly, we believe that excluding these expenses provides investors and management with greater visibility of the underlying performance of our business operations, facilitates comparison of our results with other periods and may also facilitate comparison with the results of other companies in our industry.\nThere are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and exclude expenses that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. Further, stock-based compensation expense has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business and an important part of the compensation provided to our employees.\nThe following table reconciles our GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures for the years ended 2016, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 209: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

subscriptions to our critical communications and enterprise safety applications.\nWe generally bill and collect payment for our subscriptions annually in advance. All revenue billed in advance of services being delivered is recorded in deferred revenue. The initial subscription period typically ranges from one to three years. We offer varying levels of customer support based on customer needs and the complexity of their businesses, including the level of usage by a customer in terms of minutes or the amount of data used to transmit the notifications. Our pricing model is based on the number of applications subscribed to and, per application, the\nnumber of people, locations and things connected to our platform as well as the volume of communications. We also offer premium services including data feeds for social media, threat intelligence and weather. We generate additional revenue by expanding the number of premium features and applications that our customers subscribe to and the number of contacts connected to our platform.\nWe generate an immaterial amount of revenue from set-up fees, which consist of participant process mapping, configuration, customer data migration and integration. We also sell professional services, which have been immaterial to date.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue includes expenses related to the fulfillment of our subscription services, consisting primarily of employee-related expenses for data center operations and customer support, including salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation expense. Cost of revenue also includes hosting costs, messaging costs and depreciation and amortization. As we add data center capacity and support personnel in advance of anticipated growth, our cost of revenue will increase and, if anticipated revenue growth does not occur, our gross profit will be adversely affected.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development and general and administrative expenses. Salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation expense and other personnel costs are the most significant components of each of these expense categories. We include stock-based compensation expense incurred in connection with the grant of stock options within the applicable operating expense category based on the equity award recipient's functional area.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expense primarily consists of employee-related expenses for sales, marketing and public relations employees, including salaries, bonuses, commissions, benefits and stock-based compensation expense. Sales and marketing expense also includes trade show, market research, advertising and other related external marketing expense as well as office and software related costs to support sales. We defer certain sales commissions related to acquiring new customers and amortize these expenses ratably over the term of the corresponding subscription agreement. We plan to continue to expand our sales and marketing functions to grow our customer base and increase sales to existing customers. This growth will include adding sales personnel and expanding our marketing activities to continue to generate additional leads and build brand awareness. In the near term, we expect our sales and marketing expense to increase on an absolute dollar basis as we hire new sales representatives in the United States and worldwide and grow our marketing staff.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expense primarily consists of employee-related expenses for research and development staff, including salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation expense. Research and development expense also includes the cost of certain third-party services, office related costs to support research and development activities, software subscriptions and hosting costs. We capitalize certain software development costs that are attributable to developing new applications and adding incremental functionality to our platform and amortize these costs over the estimated life of the new application or incremental functionality, which is generally three years. We focus our research and development efforts on improving our applications, developing new applications and delivering new functionality. In the near term, we expect our research and development expense to increase on an absolute dollar basis as we continue to increase the functionality of our platform and applications.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expense primarily consists of employee-related expenses for administrative, legal, finance and human resource personnel, including salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation expense. General and administrative expense also includes professional fees, insurance premiums, corporate expenses, transaction-related costs, office-related expenses, facility costs, depreciation and amortization and software license costs. In the near term, we expect our general and administrative expense to increase on an absolute dollar basis as we incur the costs associated with being a publicly traded company.\nInterest Income\nInterest income consists of interest earned on our cash balances held at financial institutions.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists of interest on our outstanding debt obligations and interest on our capital leases.\nOther Expenses, Net\nOther expenses, net consists primarily of realized foreign currency gains and losses.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of our total revenue for those periods. The period-to-period comparison of our historical results is not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in the future.\nTable 210: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year

Our principal source of liquidity is cash and cash equivalents totaling $60.8 million as of December 31, 2016, which includes the remaining net proceeds from our initial public offering completed in September 2016. We received net proceeds of $66.1 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses paid or payable by us. We have generated significant losses since inception and expect to continue to generate losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe believe that our cash balances, our available borrowings under our revolving line of credit and the cash flows generated by our operations will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. However, our belief may prove to be incorrect, and we could utilize our available financial resources sooner than we currently expect. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including those set forth in the section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K titled Risk Factors.\u201d We cannot assure you that we will be able to raise additional capital on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, if we fail to meet our operating plan during the next 12 months, our liquidity could be adversely affected.\nCash Flows\nThe following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 230: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,578\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,412\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,503\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,020\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7,404\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,136\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,120\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effects of exchange rates on cash and cash\nequivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (88\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents at end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 60,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,578\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,412\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2016, $1.5 million of the $60.8 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by foreign subsidiaries. Our intention is to indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings in our foreign subsidiaries. If these earnings were used to fund domestic operations, they would be subject to additional income taxes upon repatriation.\nSources of Funds\nInitial Public Offering\nOn September 21, 2016, we closed our initial public offering in which we issued and sold 6,250,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $12.00 per share for net proceeds of approximately $66.1 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses paid or payable by us.\nCredit Facility\nIn June 2015, we entered into a loan and security agreement with Western Alliance Bank (formerly known as Bridge Bank) to provide a secured revolving line of credit that allows us to borrow up to $10.0 million for working capital and general business requirements. In February 2016, we entered into an amendment of our loan and security agreement with Western Alliance Bank to (1) increase the capacity of our revolving line of credit by $5.0 million to $15.0 million and (2) set the minimum prime rate based on which interest due is calculated at 3.25%. No other changes were made to the loan and security agreement. The loan and security agreement, as amended, allows us to borrow up to $15.0 million for working capital and general business requirements. Amounts outstanding under the line of credit bear interest at the prime rate plus 0.75% with accrued interest payable on a monthly basis and outstanding and unpaid principal due upon maturity of the credit facility in June 2018. As of December 31, 2016, the total amount available to be borrowed by us was $15.0 million and we had no outstanding balance on the revolving line of credit.\nWestern Alliance Bank maintains a security interest in substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets, excluding intellectual property, to secure any outstanding amounts under the loan agreement. The loan agreement contains customary events of default, conditions to borrowing and covenants, including restrictions on our ability to dispose of assets, make acquisitions, incur debt, incur liens and make distributions and dividends to stockholders. The loan agreement also includes a financial covenant related to our recurring revenue renewal rate. During the continuance of an event of default, Western Alliance Bank may accelerate amounts outstanding, terminate the credit facility and foreclose on the collateral.\nUses of Funds\nOur historical uses of cash have primarily consisted of cash used for operating activities, such as expansion of our sales and marketing operations, research and development activities and other working capital needs.\nOperating Activities\nOur net loss and cash flows provided by operating activities are significantly influenced by our investments in headcount and infrastructure to support our growth, marketing and sponsorship expenses, and our ability to bill and collect in a timely manner. Our net loss has been significantly greater than our use of cash for operating activities due to the inclusion of non-cash expenses and charges.\nOperating activities provided $9.5 million in 2016, primarily from $9.6 million in cash provided as a result of changes in operating assets and liabilities, which was increased by $11.2 million of non-cash operating expenses and partially offset by our net loss of $11.3 million. Specifically, we recognized non-cash charges aggregating $7.7 million for depreciation and amortization of intangible assets, capitalized software development costs and property and equipment, $3.1 million for stock-based compensation expense, $0.4 million for the increase in our accounts receivable provision and $0.1 million related to non-cash interest on notes payable, offset by a $0.1 million decrease in our deferred income taxes. The change in operating assets and liabilities reflected a $12.0 million increase in deferred revenue, a $1.3 million increase in accrued employee-related expenses due to timing of payments, and a $0.5 million increase in accrued expenses due to timing of payments made to vendors. These increases were partially offset by a $2.3 million increase in accounts receivable, a $1.1 million increase in other assets due to timing of payments made for deferred IPO cost and commissions, a $0.4 million decrease in accounts payable due to the timing of payments made and a $0.3 million increase in prepaid expenses as a result of the increase in upfront payments made for insurance services.\nOperating activities provided $4.5 million in 2015, primarily from $7.7 million in cash provided as a result of changes in operating assets and liabilities, which was increased by $7.5 million of non-cash operating expenses and partially offset by our net loss of $10.8 million. Specifically, we recognized non-cash charges aggregating $6.0 million for depreciation and amortization of intangible assets, capitalized software development costs and property and equipment, $1.5 million for stock-based compensation expense, $0.4 million for the increase in our accounts receivable provision and $0.1 million related to non-cash interest on notes payable, offset by a $0.4 million decrease in our deferred income taxes. The change in operating assets and liabilities reflected an $11.6 million increase in deferred revenue, a $1.2 million increase in accrued employee-related expenses due to timing of payments and a $0.9 million increase in accounts payable due to timing of payments made to vendors. These increases were partially offset by a $4.8 million increase in accounts receivable, a $0.7 million increase in prepaid expenses as a result of the increase in upfront payments made for insurance services, a $0.4 million increase in other assets due to timing of payments made for deferred IPO cost and commissions and a $0.2 million decrease in accrued expenses due to the timing of payments made.\nInvesting Activities\nOur investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures for capitalized software development costs and property and equipment purchases.\nInvesting activities used $9.0 million in 2016, primarily from net cash paid in acquisitions of $2.3 million, and our investment in software development of $5.5 million and property and equipment of $1.0 million.\nInvesting activities used $7.4 million in cash in 2015, primarily from our investment in software development of $4.9 million and property and equipment of $2.5 million.\nFinancing Activities\nCash generated by financing activities includes proceeds from our initial public offering, borrowings under our term loan and credit facilities and proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of employee stock options. Cash used in financing activities includes deferred initial public offering costs and payments on capital leases, notes payable and repayments of debt under our credit facilities.\nFinancing activities provided $51.5 million of cash in 2016, which reflects proceeds of $67.8 million from our initial public offering, net of underwriter's discount and commissions, $0.8 million from the exercise of stock options and proceeds from our line of credit of $9.5 million. These amounts were offset by a $19.5 million payment on our line of credit, a $5.0 million payment on our term loan and a $2.0 million payment on notes payable related to the Vocal Limited acquisition.\nFinancing activities provided $7.2 million in cash in 2015, primarily from proceeds from our term loan of $5.0 million and proceeds from our line of credit of $12.0 million, partially offset by a $1.5 million payment to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock, $5.0 million in payments on our line of credit, $1.8 million in payments on notes payable, $1.4 million in payments attributed to deferred initial public offering costs and $0.1 million in payments on capital leases.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our commitments to settle contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016:\nTable 231: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 to 3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3 to 5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Leases (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 232: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Operating leases include total future minimum rent payments under non-cancelable operating lease agreements as described in note (18) of our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFuture minimum operating lease payments have been reduced by future minimum sublease income of $0.2 million.\nIn December 2016, we entered into a new lease for our executive offices in Burlington, Massachusetts that will increase our future minimum lease commitments over the next five years by $8.0 million.\nThe above table does not include any payments we may have to make under the contingent liability related to the Crisis Commander and IDV acquisitions, as the amount of the ultimate payments are unknown. Please see Note 5 and 19 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information.\nThe commitment amounts in the table above are associated with contracts that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum services to be used, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the actions under the contracts. The table does not include obligations under agreements that we can cancel without a significant penalty.\nBacklog\nWe sell all of our critical communications applications on a subscription basis. We generally enter into contracts that range from one to three years in length, with an average contract duration of 2.0 years as of December 31, 2016, and generally bill and collect payment annually in advance. Since we bill many of our customers at the beginning of each contract year, there can be amounts that we have not yet been contractually able to invoice. Until such time as these amounts are invoiced, they are not recorded in revenue, deferred revenue or elsewhere in our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2016, the dollar amount of this backlog believed to be firm was $39.3 million. We expect that the amount of backlog relative to the total value of our subscription agreements will change from year to year for several reasons, including the specific timing and duration of customer agreements, varying invoicing cycles of agreements, the specific timing of customer renewals and changes in customer financial circumstances. In addition, because revenue for any period is a function of revenue recognized from deferred revenue under contracts in existence at the beginning of the period, as well as contracts that are renewed and new customer contracts that are entered into during the period, backlog at the beginning of any period is not necessarily indicative of future performance. Our presentation of backlog may also differ from that of other companies in our industry. Due to these factors, as well as variances in billing arrangements with customers, we do not utilize backlog as a key management metric internally.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including entities sometimes referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities that were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. In addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements require us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenue, assets, liabilities, costs and expenses. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. Our most critical accounting policies are summarized below.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from contract subscription fees for use of our applications.\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, with respect to a transaction when all of the following conditions have been satisfied:\nTable 233: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> persuasive evidence of an agreement exists;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 234: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the service has been provided to the customer;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 235: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> fees are fixed or determinable; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 236: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the collection of the fees is reasonably assured and acceptance criteria, if any, have been met.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIf any of these criteria are not met, revenue recognition is deferred until such time that all of the criteria are met.\nOur subscription arrangements do not provide customers with the right to take possession of our software at any time.\nSubscription Revenue\nWe recognize subscription revenue ratably over the initial subscription period committed by the customer commencing when the customer's environment has been created in our hosted environment. The initial subscription period is typically one to three years and the level of service provided each customer varies based on the level of service required by the complexity of a customer's business.\nOther Revenue\nWe recognize revenue for set-up fees, which historically have not been material to our financial statements. We have concluded that set-up fees do not meet the criteria for separation from our primary service as they do not have stand-alone value as we have historically not sold set-up fees separately. We charge set-up fees for substantially all new applications and services. These set-up fees are recognized ratably over the contractual period, which approximates the life of the application. We also sell professional services, which have been immaterial to date.\nDeferred Revenue\nDeferred revenue includes amounts collected or billed in excess of recognizable revenue. Such amounts are recognized by us over the life of the contract upon meeting the revenue recognition criteria. Deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding 12-month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as non-current deferred revenue. Because the mix of billing terms with customers can vary from period to period, the annualized value of the contracts that we enter into with our customers will not be completely reflected in deferred revenue at any single point in time.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe results of businesses acquired in a business combination are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition. Purchase accounting results in assets and liabilities of an acquired business being recorded at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. Any excess consideration over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill.\nWe perform valuations of assets acquired and liabilities assumed on each acquisition accounted for as a business combination and allocate the purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on our best estimate of fair value. We determine the appropriate useful life of intangible assets by performing an analysis of cash flows based on historical experience of the acquired businesses. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives based on the pattern in which the economic benefits associated with the asset are expected to be consumed, which to date has approximated the straight-line method of amortization.\nTransaction costs associated with business combinations are expensed as incurred and are included in general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired in our business combinations. Goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Events or changes in circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include a significant adverse change in business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business, significant negative industry or economic trends, or significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future results of operations.\nWe have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, including goodwill. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, additional impairment testing is not required. However, if we conclude otherwise, we are required to perform the first step of a two-step impairment test. Alternatively, we may elect to proceed directly to the first step of the two-step impairment test and bypass the qualitative assessment.\nThe first step of the impairment test involves comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its book value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value exceeds book value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary. If, however, the fair value of the reporting unit is less than book value, the carrying amount of the goodwill is compared to its implied fair value. The estimate of implied fair value of goodwill may require valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess. We test for goodwill impairment on November 30 of each year.\nSoftware Development Costs\nWe capitalize the costs of software developed or obtained for internal use in accordance with ASC Topic 350-40, Internal Use Software. Capitalized software development costs consist of costs incurred during the application development stage and include purchased software licenses, implementation costs, consulting costs, and payroll-related costs for projects that qualify for capitalization. These costs relate to major new functionality. All other costs, primarily related to maintenance and minor software fixes, are expensed as incurred.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe recognize stock-based compensation expense for stock-based compensation awards granted to our employees, directors, consultants and other service providers that can be settled in shares of our common stock. Compensation expense for stock-based compensation awards granted is based on the grant date fair value estimate for each award as determined by our board of directors or the compensation committee of our board of directors. We recognize these compensation costs on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally four years. As stock-based compensation expense recognized is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, such expense is reduced for estimated forfeitures.\nWe estimate the fair value of stock-based compensation awards at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which was developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are freely transferable. The fair values generated by the model may not be indicative of the actual fair values of our awards as it does not consider other factors important to those stock-based payment awards, such as continued employment, periodic vesting requirements and limited transferability.\nDetermining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options. The determination of the grant date fair value of options using an option-pricing model is affected by our estimated common stock fair value as well as assumptions regarding a number of other complex and subjective variables. These variables include the fair value of our common stock, the expected term of the options, our expected stock price volatility, risk-free interest rates, and expected dividends, which are estimated as follows:\nTable 237: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Fair value of our common stock. Prior to our initial public offering, the fair value of our common stock was determined by the estimated fair value at the time of grant. For stock options granted subsequent to our initial public offering, the fair value of common stock is based on the closing market price of our common stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Market on the date of grant.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 238: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Expected term. The expected term represents the period that the stock-based compensation awards are expected to be outstanding. Since we did not have sufficient historical information to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise behavior, we use the simplified method to compute expected term, which represents the average of the time-to-vesting and the contractual life.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 239: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Expected volatility. As we have a limited trading history for our common stock, the expected stock price volatility for our common stock is estimated by taking the average historic price volatility for industry peers based on daily price observations over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock option grants. We do not rely on implied volatilities of traded options in our industry peers' common stock because the volume of activity was relatively low. We intend to continue to consistently apply this process using the same or similar public companies until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own common stock share price becomes available.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 240: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Risk-free interest rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for zero coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to the expected term of the options.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 241: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Expected dividend yield. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not presently plan to declare or pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we used an expected dividend yield of zero.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIf any of the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model change significantly, stock-based compensation for future awards may differ materially compared with the awards granted previously.\nThe following table presents the weighted-average assumptions used to estimate the fair value of options granted during the periods presented:\nTable 242: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Employee Stock Options:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected term (in years)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.29 - 6.11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.09 - 6.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.89 - 6.13\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected volatility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 60% - 70%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 60%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51.7% - 69%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.21% - 2.55%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.41% - 1.94%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.63% - 2.06%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dividend rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. This guidance eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test, instead requiring an entity to recognize a goodwill impairment charge for the amount by which the goodwill carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. This guidance is effective for interim and annual goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and early adoption is permitted. This guidance must be applied on a prospective basis. We expect to adopt this guidance for interim and annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business. This guidance narrows the definition of a business. This standard provides guidance to assist entities with evaluating when a set of transferred assets and activities is a business. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. This guidance must be applied prospectively to transactions occurring within the period of adoption. We expect to adopt this guidance effective January 1, 2018. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash. This guidance requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. As a result, restricted cash will be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, and the new guidance is to be applied retrospectively. We not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our cash flows.\nIn September 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. This guidance clarifies the presentation requirements of eight specific issues within the statement of cash flows. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial statements, as our treatment of the relevant affected items within its consolidated statement of cash flows is consistent with the requirements of this guidance.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. This standard is intended to simplify several areas of accounting for share-based compensation arrangements, including the income tax impact, classification on the statement of cash flows and forfeitures. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted. The ASU will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2017. We do not expect this ASU to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. The standard will affect all entities that lease assets and will require lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases (except for short-term leases that have a duration of less than one year) as of the date on which the lessor makes the underlying asset available to the lessee. For public companies, the new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. For leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, lessees and lessors must apply a modified retrospective transition approach. We are still evaluating the effect that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. The new standard requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. The new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. We adopted this standard retrospectively in the first quarter of 2016. The balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 was retrospectively adjusted, which resulted in reductions to other assets of $0.1 million and long-term debt of $0.1 million.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, which delays the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. The FASB also agreed to allow entities to choose to adopt the standard as of the original effective date. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. The guidance includes indicators to assist an entity in determining whether it controls a specified good or service before it is transferred to the customers. The new revenue recognition standard will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2018, with the option to adopt it in the first quarter of 2017. We currently anticipate adopting the new standard effective January 1, 2018. The new standard also permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method), or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (the modified retrospective method). We currently anticipate adopting the standard using the modified retrospective method. We are still in the process of completing our analysis on the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those under Risk Factors\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A or in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nEverbridge is a global software company that provides enterprise software applications that automate and accelerate organizations' operational response to critical events in order to keep people safe and businesses running. During public safety threats such as active shooter situations, terrorist attacks or severe weather conditions, as well as critical business events such as IT outages, cyber-attacks or other incidents such as product recalls or supply-chain interruptions, our SaaS-based platform enables our customers to quickly and reliably aggregate and assess threat data, locate people at risk and responders able to assist, automate the execution of pre-defined communications processes and track progress on executing response plans. Our customers use our platform to identify and assess hundreds of different types of threats to their organizations, people, assets or brand. Our solutions enable organizations to deliver intelligent, contextual messages to, and receive verification of delivery from, hundreds or millions of recipients, across multiple communications modalities such as voice, SMS and e-mail. Our applications enable the delivery of messages in near real-time to more than 100 different communication devices, in over 200 countries and territories, in 15 languages and dialects - all simultaneously. We delivered 1.5 billion communications in 2016. We automate the process of sending contextual notifications to multiple constituencies and receiving return information on a person's or operation's status so that organizations can act quickly and precisely. Our Critical Event Management platform is comprised of a comprehensive set of software applications that address the full spectrum of tasks an organization has to perform to manage a critical event, including Mass Notification, Incident Management, Safety Connection, IT Alerting, Visual Command Center, Crisis Commander, Community Engagement and Secure Messaging. We believe that our broad suite of integrated, enterprise applications delivered via a single global platform is a significant competitive advantage in the market for Critical Event Management solutions, which we refer to generally as CEM.\nOur customer base has grown from 867 customers at the end of 2011 to more than 3,200 customers as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, our customers were based in 28 countries and included eight of the 10 largest U.S. cities, eight of the 10 largest U.S.-based investment banks, 24 of the 25 busiest North American airports, six of the 10 largest global consulting firms, six of the 10 largest global auto makers, all four of the largest global accounting firms, four of the 10 largest U.S.-based health care providers and four of the 10 largest U.S.-based health insurers. We provide our applications to customers of varying sizes, including enterprises, small businesses, non-profit organizations, educational institutions and governmental agencies. Our customers span a wide variety of industries including technology, energy, financial services, healthcare and life sciences, manufacturing, media and entertainment, retail, higher education and professional services.\nWe sell all of our critical communications applications on a subscription basis. We generally enter into contracts that range from one to three years in length, with an average contract duration of 2.0 years as of December 31, 2016, and generally bill and collect payment annually in advance. We derive most of our revenue from subscriptions to applications. Over 90% of the revenue that we recognized in each of the eight most recently completed quarters was generated from contracts entered into in prior quarters or renewals of those contracts; the balance of the revenue that we recognized in each such quarter was generated from contracts entered into with new customers or new contracts, other than renewals, entered into with existing customers in such quarter. Historically, we derived more than 86% of our revenue in each of the last three fiscal years from sales of our Mass Notification application. Our pricing model is based on the number of applications subscribed to and, per application, the number of people, locations and things connected to our platform as well as the volume of communications. We also offer premium services including data feeds for social media, threat intelligence and weather. We generate additional revenue by expanding the number of applications that our customers subscribe to and the number of contacts and devices connected to our platform.\nWe generated revenue of $76.8 million in 2016, $58.7 million in 2015, $42.4 million in 2014 and $30.0 million in 2013, representing year-over-year increases of 41% in 2014, 38% in 2015 and 31% in 2016. We had net losses of $11.3 million, $10.8 million, $0.6 million and $0.9 million in 2016, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, 14% and 17% of our customers, respectively, were located outside of the United States and these customers generated 10% and 14% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nWe have focused on rapidly growing our business and believe that the future growth of our business is dependent on many factors, including our ability to increase the functionality of our platform and applications, expand our customer base, accelerate adoption of our applications beyond Mass Notification within our existing customer base and expand our international presence. Our future growth will also depend on the growth in the market for critical communications solutions and our ability to effectively compete. In order to further penetrate the market for critical communications solutions and capitalize on what we believe to be a significant opportunity, we intend to continue to invest in research and development, build-out our data center infrastructure and services capabilities and hire additional sales representatives, both domestically and internationally, to drive sales to new customers and incremental sales of new applications to existing customers. Nevertheless, we expect to continue to incur losses in the near term and, if we are unable to achieve our growth objectives, we may not be able to achieve profitability.\nRecent Developments\nIn September 2016, we closed our initial public offering, or IPO, at which time we sold a total of 6,250,000 shares of our common stock. We received net cash proceeds of $66.1 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and other costs associated with the offering paid or payable by us.\nIn December 2016, we acquired 100% of the shares of Svensk Krisledning AB, or Crisis Commander. We acquired Crisis Commander for cash consideration of approximately $2.3 million with additional time and performance-based milestones that could result in additional payments of $0.4 million. Crisis Commander is a SaaS mobile crisis management company operating out of Sweden.\nIn January 2017, we acquired 100% of the shares of IDV Solutions, LLC, or IDV. We acquired IDV for cash consideration of approximately $21.3 million, with additional time and performance-based milestones that could result in additional payments of $6.2 million. IDV is a provider of threat assessment and operational visualization software located in Lansing, Michigan.\nPresentation of Financial Statements\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Business acquisitions are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition. Our purchase accounting resulted in all assets and liabilities of acquired businesses being recorded at their estimated fair values on the acquisition dates. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nWe report our financial results as one operating segment. Our operating results are regularly reviewed on a consolidated basis by our chief executive officer, who is our chief operating decision maker, principally to make strategic decisions regarding how we allocate our resources and to assess our consolidated operating performance.\nOther Metrics\nWe regularly monitor a number of financial and operating metrics in order to measure our current performance and estimate our future performance. Our other business metrics may be calculated in a manner different than similar other business metrics used by other companies.\nTable 201: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue retention rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,351\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,524\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted gross margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 55,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 41,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 30,663\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Free cash flow\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,953\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u2022 Revenue Retention Rate. We calculate our revenue retention rate by dividing (1) total revenue in the current 12-month period from those customers who were customers during the prior 12-month period by (2) total revenue from all customers in the prior 12-month period. For the purposes of calculating our revenue retention rate, we count as customers all entities with whom we had contracts in the applicable period other than (1) customers of our wholly-owned subsidiary, Microtech, which generates an immaterial amount of our revenue in any given year and (2) in the first year following our acquisition of another business, customers that we acquired in connection with such acquisition. We believe that our ability to retain our customers and expand their use of our solutions over time is an indicator of the stability of our revenue base and the long-term value of our customer relationships. Our revenue retention rate provides insight into the impact on current period revenue of the number of new customers acquired during the prior 12-month period, the timing of our implementation of those new customers, growth in the usage of our solutions by our existing customers and customer attrition. If our revenue retention rate for a period exceeds 100%, this means that the revenue retained during the period including upsells more than offset the revenue that we lost from customers that did not renew their contracts during the period. Our revenue retention rate may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customers' satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our platform and applications, pricing, economic conditions or overall reductions in our customers' spending levels. \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA represents our net loss before interest income and interest expense, income tax expense and benefit, depreciation and amortization expense and stock-based compensation expense. We do not consider these items to be indicative of our core operating performance. The items that are non-cash include depreciation and amortization expense and stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA is a measure used by management to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends and to generate future operating plans, make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital and invest in initiatives that are focused on cultivating new markets for our solutions. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating adjusted EBITDA facilitates comparisons of our operating performance on a period-to-period basis. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors. Nevertheless, use of adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: (1) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the capitalized software that is amortized will need to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; (2) adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (3) adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation; (4) adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments or receipts that may represent a reduction or increase in cash available to us; and (5) other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces the usefulness of the metric as a comparative measure. Because of these and other limitations, you should consider adjusted EBITDA alongside our other GAAP-based financial performance measures, net loss and our other GAAP financial results. The following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods indicated: \nTable 204: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (11,286\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (10,824\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (623\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Benefit from income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (24\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (562\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (89\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,742\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,976\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,522\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,351\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,524\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u2022 Adjusted Gross Margin. Adjusted gross margin represents gross profit plus stock-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangibles. Adjusted gross margin is a measure used by management to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends and to generate future operating plans. The exclusion of stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquired intangibles facilitates comparisons of our operating performance on a period-to-period basis. In the near term, we expect these expenses to continue to negatively impact our gross profit. Adjusted gross margin is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe that adjusted gross margin provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors. Nevertheless, our use of adjusted gross margin has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP.

Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs. Free cash flow is a measure used by management to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends and to generate future operating plans. The exclusion of capital expenditures and amounts capitalized for internally-developed software facilitates comparisons of our operating performance on a period-to-period basis and excludes items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core operating performance. Free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe that free cash flow provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors. Nevertheless, our use of free cash flow has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP. You should consider free cash flow alongside our other GAAP-based financial performance measures, net cash provided by operating activities, and our other GAAP financial results. The following table presents a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash for operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods indicated: \nTable 208: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,503\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (970\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,502\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,155\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capitalized software development costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,494\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,902\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,677\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Free cash flow\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,953\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdditional Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we provide investors with certain additional supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP cost of revenue, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP sales and marketing expense, non-GAAP research and development expense, non-GAAP general and administrative expense, non-GAAP total operating expenses, non-GAAP operating loss and non-GAAP net loss, which we collectively refer to as non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude all or a combination of the following (as reflected in the following reconciliation tables): stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquired intangibles. The presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making purposes and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about our operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects and allow for greater transparency with respect to metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision making. While our non-GAAP financial measures are an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating our own operating results over different periods of time, you should consider our non-GAAP financial measures alongside our GAAP financial results.\nWe exclude stock-based compensation expense because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of equity instruments that can impact our non-cash expense. We believe that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation expense allow for more meaningful comparisons between our operating results from period to period. We believe that excluding the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles allows for more meaningful comparisons between operating results from period to period as the intangibles are valued at the time of acquisition and are amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition. Accordingly, we believe that excluding these expenses provides investors and management with greater visibility of the underlying performance of our business operations, facilitates comparison of our results with other periods and may also facilitate comparison with the results of other companies in our industry.\nThere are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and exclude expenses that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. Further, stock-based compensation expense has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business and an important part of the compensation provided to our employees.\nThe following table reconciles our GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures for the years ended 2016, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 209: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

subscriptions to our critical communications and enterprise safety applications.\nWe generally bill and collect payment for our subscriptions annually in advance. All revenue billed in advance of services being delivered is recorded in deferred revenue. The initial subscription period typically ranges from one to three years. We offer varying levels of customer support based on customer needs and the complexity of their businesses, including the level of usage by a customer in terms of minutes or the amount of data used to transmit the notifications. Our pricing model is based on the number of applications subscribed to and, per application, the\nnumber of people, locations and things connected to our platform as well as the volume of communications. We also offer premium services including data feeds for social media, threat intelligence and weather. We generate additional revenue by expanding the number of premium features and applications that our customers subscribe to and the number of contacts connected to our platform.\nWe generate an immaterial amount of revenue from set-up fees, which consist of participant process mapping, configuration, customer data migration and integration. We also sell professional services, which have been immaterial to date.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue includes expenses related to the fulfillment of our subscription services, consisting primarily of employee-related expenses for data center operations and customer support, including salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation expense. Cost of revenue also includes hosting costs, messaging costs and depreciation and amortization. As we add data center capacity and support personnel in advance of anticipated growth, our cost of revenue will increase and, if anticipated revenue growth does not occur, our gross profit will be adversely affected.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development and general and administrative expenses. Salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation expense and other personnel costs are the most significant components of each of these expense categories. We include stock-based compensation expense incurred in connection with the grant of stock options within the applicable operating expense category based on the equity award recipient's functional area.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expense primarily consists of employee-related expenses for sales, marketing and public relations employees, including salaries, bonuses, commissions, benefits and stock-based compensation expense. Sales and marketing expense also includes trade show, market research, advertising and other related external marketing expense as well as office and software related costs to support sales. We defer certain sales commissions related to acquiring new customers and amortize these expenses ratably over the term of the corresponding subscription agreement. We plan to continue to expand our sales and marketing functions to grow our customer base and increase sales to existing customers. This growth will include adding sales personnel and expanding our marketing activities to continue to generate additional leads and build brand awareness. In the near term, we expect our sales and marketing expense to increase on an absolute dollar basis as we hire new sales representatives in the United States and worldwide and grow our marketing staff.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expense primarily consists of employee-related expenses for research and development staff, including salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation expense. Research and development expense also includes the cost of certain third-party services, office related costs to support research and development activities, software subscriptions and hosting costs. We capitalize certain software development costs that are attributable to developing new applications and adding incremental functionality to our platform and amortize these costs over the estimated life of the new application or incremental functionality, which is generally three years. We focus our research and development efforts on improving our applications, developing new applications and delivering new functionality. In the near term, we expect our research and development expense to increase on an absolute dollar basis as we continue to increase the functionality of our platform and applications.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expense primarily consists of employee-related expenses for administrative, legal, finance and human resource personnel, including salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation expense. General and administrative expense also includes professional fees, insurance premiums, corporate expenses, transaction-related costs, office-related expenses, facility costs, depreciation and amortization and software license costs. In the near term, we expect our general and administrative expense to increase on an absolute dollar basis as we incur the costs associated with being a publicly traded company.\nInterest Income\nInterest income consists of interest earned on our cash balances held at financial institutions.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists of interest on our outstanding debt obligations and interest on our capital leases.\nOther Expenses, Net\nOther expenses, net consists primarily of realized foreign currency gains and losses.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of our total revenue for those periods. The period-to-period comparison of our historical results is not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in the future.\nTable 210: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year

These increases were offset by a $0.6 million decrease in professional fees due to a decrease in legal, accounting and audit services in 2016.\nOther Expense, Net\nTable 221: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (115\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (19.2\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther expense, net decreased by $0.1 million in 2016 compared to 2015 as a result of a decrease in interest expense related to interest expense due under our term loan and revolving line of credit, which were paid off in September 2016 with the proceeds of our IPO.\nIncome Taxes\nTable 222: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Benefit from income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (24\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (562\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (95.7\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBenefit from income taxes decreased by $0.5 million in 2016 compared to 2015 due to the placement of a full valuation allowance on our foreign deferred taxes.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nRevenue\nTable 223: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 58,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 42,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,299\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue increased by $16.3 million in 2015 compared to 2014.

Our principal source of liquidity is cash and cash equivalents totaling $60.8 million as of December 31, 2016, which includes the remaining net proceeds from our initial public offering completed in September 2016. We received net proceeds of $66.1 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses paid or payable by us. We have generated significant losses since inception and expect to continue to generate losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe believe that our cash balances, our available borrowings under our revolving line of credit and the cash flows generated by our operations will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. However, our belief may prove to be incorrect, and we could utilize our available financial resources sooner than we currently expect. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including those set forth in the section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K titled Risk Factors.\u201d We cannot assure you that we will be able to raise additional capital on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, if we fail to meet our operating plan during the next 12 months, our liquidity could be adversely affected.\nCash Flows\nThe following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 230: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,578\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,412\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,503\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,020\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7,404\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,136\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,120\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effects of exchange rates on cash and cash\nequivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (88\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents at end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 60,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,578\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,412\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2016, $1.5 million of the $60.8 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by foreign subsidiaries. Our intention is to indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings in our foreign subsidiaries. If these earnings were used to fund domestic operations, they would be subject to additional income taxes upon repatriation.\nSources of Funds\nInitial Public Offering\nOn September 21, 2016, we closed our initial public offering in which we issued and sold 6,250,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $12.00 per share for net proceeds of approximately $66.1 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses paid or payable by us.\nCredit Facility\nIn June 2015, we entered into a loan and security agreement with Western Alliance Bank (formerly known as Bridge Bank) to provide a secured revolving line of credit that allows us to borrow up to $10.0 million for working capital and general business requirements. In February 2016, we entered into an amendment of our loan and security agreement with Western Alliance Bank to (1) increase the capacity of our revolving line of credit by $5.0 million to $15.0 million and (2) set the minimum prime rate based on which interest due is calculated at 3.25%. No other changes were made to the loan and security agreement. The loan and security agreement, as amended, allows us to borrow up to $15.0 million for working capital and general business requirements. Amounts outstanding under the line of credit bear interest at the prime rate plus 0.75% with accrued interest payable on a monthly basis and outstanding and unpaid principal due upon maturity of the credit facility in June 2018. As of December 31, 2016, the total amount available to be borrowed by us was $15.0 million and we had no outstanding balance on the revolving line of credit.\nWestern Alliance Bank maintains a security interest in substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets, excluding intellectual property, to secure any outstanding amounts under the loan agreement. The loan agreement contains customary events of default, conditions to borrowing and covenants, including restrictions on our ability to dispose of assets, make acquisitions, incur debt, incur liens and make distributions and dividends to stockholders. The loan agreement also includes a financial covenant related to our recurring revenue renewal rate. During the continuance of an event of default, Western Alliance Bank may accelerate amounts outstanding, terminate the credit facility and foreclose on the collateral.\nUses of Funds\nOur historical uses of cash have primarily consisted of cash used for operating activities, such as expansion of our sales and marketing operations, research and development activities and other working capital needs.\nOperating Activities\nOur net loss and cash flows provided by operating activities are significantly influenced by our investments in headcount and infrastructure to support our growth, marketing and sponsorship expenses, and our ability to bill and collect in a timely manner. Our net loss has been significantly greater than our use of cash for operating activities due to the inclusion of non-cash expenses and charges.\nOperating activities provided $9.5 million in 2016, primarily from $9.6 million in cash provided as a result of changes in operating assets and liabilities, which was increased by $11.2 million of non-cash operating expenses and partially offset by our net loss of $11.3 million. Specifically, we recognized non-cash charges aggregating $7.7 million for depreciation and amortization of intangible assets, capitalized software development costs and property and equipment, $3.1 million for stock-based compensation expense, $0.4 million for the increase in our accounts receivable provision and $0.1 million related to non-cash interest on notes payable, offset by a $0.1 million decrease in our deferred income taxes. The change in operating assets and liabilities reflected a $12.0 million increase in deferred revenue, a $1.3 million increase in accrued employee-related expenses due to timing of payments, and a $0.5 million increase in accrued expenses due to timing of payments made to vendors. These increases were partially offset by a $2.3 million increase in accounts receivable, a $1.1 million increase in other assets due to timing of payments made for deferred IPO cost and commissions, a $0.4 million decrease in accounts payable due to the timing of payments made and a $0.3 million increase in prepaid expenses as a result of the increase in upfront payments made for insurance services.\nOperating activities provided $4.5 million in 2015, primarily from $7.7 million in cash provided as a result of changes in operating assets and liabilities, which was increased by $7.5 million of non-cash operating expenses and partially offset by our net loss of $10.8 million. Specifically, we recognized non-cash charges aggregating $6.0 million for depreciation and amortization of intangible assets, capitalized software development costs and property and equipment, $1.5 million for stock-based compensation expense, $0.4 million for the increase in our accounts receivable provision and $0.1 million related to non-cash interest on notes payable, offset by a $0.4 million decrease in our deferred income taxes. The change in operating assets and liabilities reflected an $11.6 million increase in deferred revenue, a $1.2 million increase in accrued employee-related expenses due to timing of payments and a $0.9 million increase in accounts payable due to timing of payments made to vendors. These increases were partially offset by a $4.8 million increase in accounts receivable, a $0.7 million increase in prepaid expenses as a result of the increase in upfront payments made for insurance services, a $0.4 million increase in other assets due to timing of payments made for deferred IPO cost and commissions and a $0.2 million decrease in accrued expenses due to the timing of payments made.\nInvesting Activities\nOur investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures for capitalized software development costs and property and equipment purchases.\nInvesting activities used $9.0 million in 2016, primarily from net cash paid in acquisitions of $2.3 million, and our investment in software development of $5.5 million and property and equipment of $1.0 million.\nInvesting activities used $7.4 million in cash in 2015, primarily from our investment in software development of $4.9 million and property and equipment of $2.5 million.\nFinancing Activities\nCash generated by financing activities includes proceeds from our initial public offering, borrowings under our term loan and credit facilities and proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of employee stock options. Cash used in financing activities includes deferred initial public offering costs and payments on capital leases, notes payable and repayments of debt under our credit facilities.\nFinancing activities provided $51.5 million of cash in 2016, which reflects proceeds of $67.8 million from our initial public offering, net of underwriter's discount and commissions, $0.8 million from the exercise of stock options and proceeds from our line of credit of $9.5 million. These amounts were offset by a $19.5 million payment on our line of credit, a $5.0 million payment on our term loan and a $2.0 million payment on notes payable related to the Vocal Limited acquisition.\nFinancing activities provided $7.2 million in cash in 2015, primarily from proceeds from our term loan of $5.0 million and proceeds from our line of credit of $12.0 million, partially offset by a $1.5 million payment to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock, $5.0 million in payments on our line of credit, $1.8 million in payments on notes payable, $1.4 million in payments attributed to deferred initial public offering costs and $0.1 million in payments on capital leases.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our commitments to settle contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016:\nTable 231: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 to 3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3 to 5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Leases (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Operating leases include total future minimum rent payments under non-cancelable operating lease agreements as described in note (18) of our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nFuture minimum operating lease payments have been reduced by future minimum sublease income of $0.2 million.\nIn December 2016, we entered into a new lease for our executive offices in Burlington, Massachusetts that will increase our future minimum lease commitments over the next five years by $8.0 million.\nThe above table does not include any payments we may have to make under the contingent liability related to the Crisis Commander and IDV acquisitions, as the amount of the ultimate payments are unknown. Please see Note 5 and 19 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information.\nThe commitment amounts in the table above are associated with contracts that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum services to be used, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the actions under the contracts. The table does not include obligations under agreements that we can cancel without a significant penalty.\nBacklog\nWe sell all of our critical communications applications on a subscription basis. We generally enter into contracts that range from one to three years in length, with an average contract duration of 2.0 years as of December 31, 2016, and generally bill and collect payment annually in advance. Since we bill many of our customers at the beginning of each contract year, there can be amounts that we have not yet been contractually able to invoice. Until such time as these amounts are invoiced, they are not recorded in revenue, deferred revenue or elsewhere in our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2016, the dollar amount of this backlog believed to be firm was $39.3 million. We expect that the amount of backlog relative to the total value of our subscription agreements will change from year to year for several reasons, including the specific timing and duration of customer agreements, varying invoicing cycles of agreements, the specific timing of customer renewals and changes in customer financial circumstances. In addition, because revenue for any period is a function of revenue recognized from deferred revenue under contracts in existence at the beginning of the period, as well as contracts that are renewed and new customer contracts that are entered into during the period, backlog at the beginning of any period is not necessarily indicative of future performance. Our presentation of backlog may also differ from that of other companies in our industry. Due to these factors, as well as variances in billing arrangements with customers, we do not utilize backlog as a key management metric internally.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including entities sometimes referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities that were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. In addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements require us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenue, assets, liabilities, costs and expenses. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. Our most critical accounting policies are summarized below.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from contract subscription fees for use of our applications.\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, with respect to a transaction when all of the following conditions have been satisfied:\n \u2022 persuasive evidence of an agreement exists; \n \u2022 the service has been provided to the customer; \n \u2022 fees are fixed or determinable; and \n \u2022 the collection of the fees is reasonably assured and acceptance criteria, if any, have been met. \nIf any of these criteria are not met, revenue recognition is deferred until such time that all of the criteria are met.\nOur subscription arrangements do not provide customers with the right to take possession of our software at any time.\nSubscription Revenue\nWe recognize subscription revenue ratably over the initial subscription period committed by the customer commencing when the customer's environment has been created in our hosted environment. The initial subscription period is typically one to three years and the level of service provided each customer varies based on the level of service required by the complexity of a customer's business.\nOther Revenue\nWe recognize revenue for set-up fees, which historically have not been material to our financial statements. We have concluded that set-up fees do not meet the criteria for separation from our primary service as they do not have stand-alone value as we have historically not sold set-up fees separately. We charge set-up fees for substantially all new applications and services. These set-up fees are recognized ratably over the contractual period, which approximates the life of the application. We also sell professional services, which have been immaterial to date.\nDeferred Revenue\nDeferred revenue includes amounts collected or billed in excess of recognizable revenue. Such amounts are recognized by us over the life of the contract upon meeting the revenue recognition criteria. Deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding 12-month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as non-current deferred revenue. Because the mix of billing terms with customers can vary from period to period, the annualized value of the contracts that we enter into with our customers will not be completely reflected in deferred revenue at any single point in time.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe results of businesses acquired in a business combination are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition. Purchase accounting results in assets and liabilities of an acquired business being recorded at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. Any excess consideration over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill.\nWe perform valuations of assets acquired and liabilities assumed on each acquisition accounted for as a business combination and allocate the purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on our best estimate of fair value. We determine the appropriate useful life of intangible assets by performing an analysis of cash flows based on historical experience of the acquired businesses. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives based on the pattern in which the economic benefits associated with the asset are expected to be consumed, which to date has approximated the straight-line method of amortization.\nTransaction costs associated with business combinations are expensed as incurred and are included in general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired in our business combinations. Goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Events or changes in circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include a significant adverse change in business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business, significant negative industry or economic trends, or significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future results of operations.\nWe have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, including goodwill. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, additional impairment testing is not required. However, if we conclude otherwise, we are required to perform the first step of a two-step impairment test. Alternatively, we may elect to proceed directly to the first step of the two-step impairment test and bypass the qualitative assessment.\nThe first step of the impairment test involves comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its book value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value exceeds book value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary. If, however, the fair value of the reporting unit is less than book value, the carrying amount of the goodwill is compared to its implied fair value. The estimate of implied fair value of goodwill may require valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess. We test for goodwill impairment on November 30 of each year.\nSoftware Development Costs\nWe capitalize the costs of software developed or obtained for internal use in accordance with ASC Topic 350-40, Internal Use Software. Capitalized software development costs consist of costs incurred during the application development stage and include purchased software licenses, implementation costs, consulting costs, and payroll-related costs for projects that qualify for capitalization. These costs relate to major new functionality. All other costs, primarily related to maintenance and minor software fixes, are expensed as incurred.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe recognize stock-based compensation expense for stock-based compensation awards granted to our employees, directors, consultants and other service providers that can be settled in shares of our common stock. Compensation expense for stock-based compensation awards granted is based on the grant date fair value estimate for each award as determined by our board of directors or the compensation committee of our board of directors. We recognize these compensation costs on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally four years. As stock-based compensation expense recognized is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, such expense is reduced for estimated forfeitures.\nWe estimate the fair value of stock-based compensation awards at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which was developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are freely transferable. The fair values generated by the model may not be indicative of the actual fair values of our awards as it does not consider other factors important to those stock-based payment awards, such as continued employment, periodic vesting requirements and limited transferability.\nDetermining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options. The determination of the grant date fair value of options using an option-pricing model is affected by our estimated common stock fair value as well as assumptions regarding a number of other complex and subjective variables. These variables include the fair value of our common stock, the expected term of the options, our expected stock price volatility, risk-free interest rates, and expected dividends, which are estimated as follows:\n \u2022 Fair value of our common stock. Prior to our initial public offering, the fair value of our common stock was determined by the estimated fair value at the time of grant. For stock options granted subsequent to our initial public offering, the fair value of common stock is based on the closing market price of our common stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Market on the date of grant. \n \u2022 Expected term. The expected term represents the period that the stock-based compensation awards are expected to be outstanding. Since we did not have sufficient historical information to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise behavior, we use the simplified method to compute expected term, which represents the average of the time-to-vesting and the contractual life. \n \u2022 Expected volatility. As we have a limited trading history for our common stock, the expected stock price volatility for our common stock is estimated by taking the average historic price volatility for industry peers based on daily price observations over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock option grants. We do not rely on implied volatilities of traded options in our industry peers' common stock because the volume of activity was relatively low. We intend to continue to consistently apply this process using the same or similar public companies until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own common stock share price becomes available. \n \u2022 Risk-free interest rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for zero coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to the expected term of the options. \n \u2022 Expected dividend yield. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not presently plan to declare or pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we used an expected dividend yield of zero. \nIf any of the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model change significantly, stock-based compensation for future awards may differ materially compared with the awards granted previously.\nThe following table presents the weighted-average assumptions used to estimate the fair value of options granted during the periods presented:\nTable 242: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Employee Stock Options:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected term (in years)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.29 - 6.11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.09 - 6.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.89 - 6.13\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected volatility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 60% - 70%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 60%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51.7% - 69%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.21% - 2.55%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.41% - 1.94%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.63% - 2.06%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dividend rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. This guidance eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test, instead requiring an entity to recognize a goodwill impairment charge for the amount by which the goodwill carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. This guidance is effective for interim and annual goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and early adoption is permitted. This guidance must be applied on a prospective basis. We expect to adopt this guidance for interim and annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business. This guidance narrows the definition of a business. This standard provides guidance to assist entities with evaluating when a set of transferred assets and activities is a business. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. This guidance must be applied prospectively to transactions occurring within the period of adoption. We expect to adopt this guidance effective January 1, 2018. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash. This guidance requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. As a result, restricted cash will be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, and the new guidance is to be applied retrospectively. We not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our cash flows.\nIn September 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. This guidance clarifies the presentation requirements of eight specific issues within the statement of cash flows. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial statements, as our treatment of the relevant affected items within its consolidated statement of cash flows is consistent with the requirements of this guidance.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. This standard is intended to simplify several areas of accounting for share-based compensation arrangements, including the income tax impact, classification on the statement of cash flows and forfeitures. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted. The ASU will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2017. We do not expect this ASU to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. The standard will affect all entities that lease assets and will require lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases (except for short-term leases that have a duration of less than one year) as of the date on which the lessor makes the underlying asset available to the lessee. For public companies, the new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. For leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, lessees and lessors must apply a modified retrospective transition approach. We are still evaluating the effect that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. The new standard requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. The new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. We adopted this standard retrospectively in the first quarter of 2016. The balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 was retrospectively adjusted, which resulted in reductions to other assets of $0.1 million and long-term debt of $0.1 million.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, which delays the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. The FASB also agreed to allow entities to choose to adopt the standard as of the original effective date. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. The guidance includes indicators to assist an entity in determining whether it controls a specified good or service before it is transferred to the customers. The new revenue recognition standard will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2018, with the option to adopt it in the first quarter of 2017. We currently anticipate adopting the new standard effective January 1, 2018. The new standard also permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method), or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (the modified retrospective method). We currently anticipate adopting the standard using the modified retrospective method. We are still in the process of completing our analysis on the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those under Risk Factors\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A or in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nEverbridge is a global software company that provides enterprise software applications that automate and accelerate organizations' operational response to critical events in order to keep people safe and businesses running. During public safety threats such as active shooter situations, terrorist attacks or severe weather conditions, as well as critical business events such as IT outages, cyber-attacks or other incidents such as product recalls or supply-chain interruptions, our SaaS-based platform enables our customers to quickly and reliably aggregate and assess threat data, locate people at risk and responders able to assist, automate the execution of pre-defined communications processes and track progress on executing response plans. Our customers use our platform to identify and assess hundreds of different types of threats to their organizations, people, assets or brand. Our solutions enable organizations to deliver intelligent, contextual messages to, and receive verification of delivery from, hundreds or millions of recipients, across multiple communications modalities such as voice, SMS and e-mail. Our applications enable the delivery of messages in near real-time to more than 100 different communication devices, in over 200 countries and territories, in 15 languages and dialects - all simultaneously. We delivered 1.5 billion communications in 2016. We automate the process of sending contextual notifications to multiple constituencies and receiving return information on a person's or operation's status so that organizations can act quickly and precisely. Our Critical Event Management platform is comprised of a comprehensive set of software applications that address the full spectrum of tasks an organization has to perform to manage a critical event, including Mass Notification, Incident Management, Safety Connection, IT Alerting, Visual Command Center, Crisis Commander, Community Engagement and Secure Messaging. We believe that our broad suite of integrated, enterprise applications delivered via a single global platform is a significant competitive advantage in the market for Critical Event Management solutions, which we refer to generally as CEM.\nOur customer base has grown from 867 customers at the end of 2011 to more than 3,200 customers as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, our customers were based in 28 countries and included eight of the 10 largest U.S. cities, eight of the 10 largest U.S.-based investment banks, 24 of the 25 busiest North American airports, six of the 10 largest global consulting firms, six of the 10 largest global auto makers, all four of the largest global accounting firms, four of the 10 largest U.S.-based health care providers and four of the 10 largest U.S.-based health insurers. We provide our applications to customers of varying sizes, including enterprises, small businesses, non-profit organizations, educational institutions and governmental agencies. Our customers span a wide variety of industries including technology, energy, financial services, healthcare and life sciences, manufacturing, media and entertainment, retail, higher education and professional services.\nWe sell all of our critical communications applications on a subscription basis. We generally enter into contracts that range from one to three years in length, with an average contract duration of 2.0 years as of December 31, 2016, and generally bill and collect payment annually in advance. We derive most of our revenue from subscriptions to applications. Over 90% of the revenue that we recognized in each of the eight most recently completed quarters was generated from contracts entered into in prior quarters or renewals of those contracts; the balance of the revenue that we recognized in each such quarter was generated from contracts entered into with new customers or new contracts, other than renewals, entered into with existing customers in such quarter. Historically, we derived more than 86% of our revenue in each of the last three fiscal years from sales of our Mass Notification application. Our pricing model is based on the number of applications subscribed to and, per application, the number of people, locations and things connected to our platform as well as the volume of communications. We also offer premium services including data feeds for social media, threat intelligence and weather. We generate additional revenue by expanding the number of applications that our customers subscribe to and the number of contacts and devices connected to our platform.\nWe generated revenue of $76.8 million in 2016, $58.7 million in 2015, $42.4 million in 2014 and $30.0 million in 2013, representing year-over-year increases of 41% in 2014, 38% in 2015 and 31% in 2016. We had net losses of $11.3 million, $10.8 million, $0.6 million and $0.9 million in 2016, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, 14% and 17% of our customers, respectively, were located outside of the United States and these customers generated 10% and 14% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nWe have focused on rapidly growing our business and believe that the future growth of our business is dependent on many factors, including our ability to increase the functionality of our platform and applications, expand our customer base, accelerate adoption of our applications beyond Mass Notification within our existing customer base and expand our international presence. Our future growth will also depend on the growth in the market for critical communications solutions and our ability to effectively compete. In order to further penetrate the market for critical communications solutions and capitalize on what we believe to be a significant opportunity, we intend to continue to invest in research and development, build-out our data center infrastructure and services capabilities and hire additional sales representatives, both domestically and internationally, to drive sales to new customers and incremental sales of new applications to existing customers. Nevertheless, we expect to continue to incur losses in the near term and, if we are unable to achieve our growth objectives, we may not be able to achieve profitability.\nRecent Developments\nIn September 2016, we closed our initial public offering, or IPO, at which time we sold a total of 6,250,000 shares of our common stock. We received net cash proceeds of $66.1 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and other costs associated with the offering paid or payable by us.\nIn December 2016, we acquired 100% of the shares of Svensk Krisledning AB, or Crisis Commander. We acquired Crisis Commander for cash consideration of approximately $2.3 million with additional time and performance-based milestones that could result in additional payments of $0.4 million. Crisis Commander is a SaaS mobile crisis management company operating out of Sweden.\nIn January 2017, we acquired 100% of the shares of IDV Solutions, LLC, or IDV. We acquired IDV for cash consideration of approximately $21.3 million, with additional time and performance-based milestones that could result in additional payments of $6.2 million. IDV is a provider of threat assessment and operational visualization software located in Lansing, Michigan.\nPresentation of Financial Statements\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Business acquisitions are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition. Our purchase accounting resulted in all assets and liabilities of acquired businesses being recorded at their estimated fair values on the acquisition dates. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nWe report our financial results as one operating segment. Our operating results are regularly reviewed on a consolidated basis by our chief executive officer, who is our chief operating decision maker, principally to make strategic decisions regarding how we allocate our resources and to assess our consolidated operating performance.\nOther Metrics\nWe regularly monitor a number of financial and operating metrics in order to measure our current performance and estimate our future performance. Our other business metrics may be calculated in a manner different than similar other business metrics used by other companies.\n\n \u2022 Revenue Retention Rate. We calculate our revenue retention rate by dividing (1) total revenue in the current 12-month period from those customers who were customers during the prior 12-month period by (2) total revenue from all customers in the prior 12-month period. For the purposes of calculating our revenue retention rate, we count as customers all entities with whom we had contracts in the applicable period other than (1) customers of our wholly-owned subsidiary, Microtech, which generates an immaterial amount of our revenue in any given year and (2) in the first year following our acquisition of another business, customers that we acquired in connection with such acquisition. We believe that our ability to retain our customers and expand their use of our solutions over time is an indicator of the stability of our revenue base and the long-term value of our customer relationships. Our revenue retention rate provides insight into the impact on current period revenue of the number of new customers acquired during the prior 12-month period, the timing of our implementation of those new customers, growth in the usage of our solutions by our existing customers and customer attrition. If our revenue retention rate for a period exceeds 100%, this means that the revenue retained during the period including upsells more than offset the revenue that we lost from customers that did not renew their contracts during the period. Our revenue retention rate may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customers' satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our platform and applications, pricing, economic conditions or overall reductions in our customers' spending levels. \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA represents our net loss before interest income and interest expense, income tax expense and benefit, depreciation and amortization expense and stock-based compensation expense. We do not consider these items to be indicative of our core operating performance. The items that are non-cash include depreciation and amortization expense and stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA is a measure used by management to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends and to generate future operating plans, make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital and invest in initiatives that are focused on cultivating new markets for our solutions. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating adjusted EBITDA facilitates comparisons of our operating performance on a period-to-period basis. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors. Nevertheless, use of adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: (1) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the capitalized software that is amortized will need to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; (2) adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (3) adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation; (4) adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments or receipts that may represent a reduction or increase in cash available to us; and (5) other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces the usefulness of the metric as a comparative measure. Because of these and other limitations, you should consider adjusted EBITDA alongside our other GAAP-based financial performance measures, net loss and our other GAAP financial results. The following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods indicated: \n\n \u2022 Adjusted Gross Margin. Adjusted gross margin represents gross profit plus stock-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangibles. Adjusted gross margin is a measure used by management to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends and to generate future operating plans. The exclusion of stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquired intangibles facilitates comparisons of our operating performance on a period-to-period basis. In the near term, we expect these expenses to continue to negatively impact our gross profit. Adjusted gross margin is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe that adjusted gross margin provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors. Nevertheless, our use of adjusted gross margin has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP. You should consider adjusted gross margin alongside our other GAAP-based financial performance measures, gross profit and our other GAAP financial results. The following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted gross margin to gross profit, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods indicated: \n\n \u2022 Free Cash Flow. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs. Free cash flow is a measure used by management to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends and to generate future operating plans. The exclusion of capital expenditures and amounts capitalized for internally-developed software facilitates comparisons of our operating performance on a period-to-period basis and excludes items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core operating performance. Free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe that free cash flow provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors. Nevertheless, our use of free cash flow has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP. You should consider free cash flow alongside our other GAAP-based financial performance measures, net cash provided by operating activities, and our other GAAP financial results. The following table presents a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash for operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods indicated: \n\nAdditional Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we provide investors with certain additional supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP cost of revenue, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP sales and marketing expense, non-GAAP research and development expense, non-GAAP general and administrative expense, non-GAAP total operating expenses, non-GAAP operating loss and non-GAAP net loss, which we collectively refer to as non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude all or a combination of the following (as reflected in the following reconciliation tables): stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquired intangibles. The presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making purposes and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about our operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects and allow for greater transparency with respect to metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision making. While our non-GAAP financial measures are an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating our own operating results over different periods of time, you should consider our non-GAAP financial measures alongside our GAAP financial results.\nWe exclude stock-based compensation expense because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of equity instruments that can impact our non-cash expense. We believe that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation expense allow for more meaningful comparisons between our operating results from period to period. We believe that excluding the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles allows for more meaningful comparisons between operating results from period to period as the intangibles are valued at the time of acquisition and are amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition. Accordingly, we believe that excluding these expenses provides investors and management with greater visibility of the underlying performance of our business operations, facilitates comparison of our results with other periods and may also facilitate comparison with the results of other companies in our industry.\nThere are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and exclude expenses that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. Further, stock-based compensation expense has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business and an important part of the compensation provided to our employees.\nThe following table reconciles our GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures for the years ended 2016, 2015 and 2014:\n\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from the sale of subscriptions to our critical communications and enterprise safety applications.\nWe generally bill and collect payment for our subscriptions annually in advance. All revenue billed in advance of services being delivered is recorded in deferred revenue. The initial subscription period typically ranges from one to three years. We offer varying levels of customer support based on customer needs and the complexity of their businesses, including the level of usage by a customer in terms of minutes or the amount of data used to transmit the notifications. Our pricing model is based on the number of applications subscribed to and, per application, the\nnumber of people, locations and things connected to our platform as well as the volume of communications. We also offer premium services including data feeds for social media, threat intelligence and weather. We generate additional revenue by expanding the number of premium features and applications that our customers subscribe to and the number of contacts connected to our platform.\nWe generate an immaterial amount of revenue from set-up fees, which consist of participant process mapping, configuration, customer data migration and integration. We also sell professional services, which have been immaterial to date.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue includes expenses related to the fulfillment of our subscription services, consisting primarily of employee-related expenses for data center operations and customer support, including salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation expense. Cost of revenue also includes hosting costs, messaging costs and depreciation and amortization. As we add data center capacity and support personnel in advance of anticipated growth, our cost of revenue will increase and, if anticipated revenue growth does not occur, our gross profit will be adversely affected.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development and general and administrative expenses. Salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation expense and other personnel costs are the most significant components of each of these expense categories. We include stock-based compensation expense incurred in connection with the grant of stock options within the applicable operating expense category based on the equity award recipient's functional area.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expense primarily consists of employee-related expenses for sales, marketing and public relations employees, including salaries, bonuses, commissions, benefits and stock-based compensation expense. Sales and marketing expense also includes trade show, market research, advertising and other related external marketing expense as well as office and software related costs to support sales. We defer certain sales commissions related to acquiring new customers and amortize these expenses ratably over the term of the corresponding subscription agreement. We plan to continue to expand our sales and marketing functions to grow our customer base and increase sales to existing customers. This growth will include adding sales personnel and expanding our marketing activities to continue to generate additional leads and build brand awareness. In the near term, we expect our sales and marketing expense to increase on an absolute dollar basis as we hire new sales representatives in the United States and worldwide and grow our marketing staff.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expense primarily consists of employee-related expenses for research and development staff, including salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation expense. Research and development expense also includes the cost of certain third-party services, office related costs to support research and development activities, software subscriptions and hosting costs. We capitalize certain software development costs that are attributable to developing new applications and adding incremental functionality to our platform and amortize these costs over the estimated life of the new application or incremental functionality, which is generally three years. We focus our research and development efforts on improving our applications, developing new applications and delivering new functionality. In the near term, we expect our research and development expense to increase on an absolute dollar basis as we continue to increase the functionality of our platform and applications.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expense primarily consists of employee-related expenses for administrative, legal, finance and human resource personnel, including salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation expense. General and administrative expense also includes professional fees, insurance premiums, corporate expenses, transaction-related costs, office-related expenses, facility costs, depreciation and amortization and software license costs. In the near term, we expect our general and administrative expense to increase on an absolute dollar basis as we incur the costs associated with being a publicly traded company.\nInterest Income\nInterest income consists of interest earned on our cash balances held at financial institutions.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists of interest on our outstanding debt obligations and interest on our capital leases.\nOther Expenses, Net\nOther expenses, net consists primarily of realized foreign currency gains and losses.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of our total revenue for those periods. The period-to-period comparison of our historical results is not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in the future.\n\n (1) Includes stock-based compensation expense and depreciation and amortization as follows: \n\n\n (1) Columns may not add up to 100% due to rounding. \n * Represents less than 0.5% of revenue. \nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nRevenue\n\nRevenue increased by $18.1 million in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase was primarily due to an $18.1 million increase in sales of our solutions driven by expansion of our customer base from 2,662 customers as of December 31, 2015 to 3,205 as of December 31, 2016, including increased sales to larger organizations with greater numbers of contacts and locations.\nCost of Revenue\n\nCost of revenue increased by $4.0 million in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase was primarily due to a $1.5 million increase in employee-related costs associated with our increased headcount from 90 employees as of December 31, 2015 to 98 employees as of December 31, 2016. The remaining increase was principally the result of a $1.8 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense attributable to our acquired intangible assets, a $0.9 million increase in hosting and messaging costs, offset by a $0.2 million decrease in office related expenses.\nGross margin percentage increased due to our continued investment in personnel to support our growth in revenue, which was greater than our growth in expenses.\nOperating Expenses\nSales and Marketing Expense\n\nSales and marketing expense increased by $8.9 million in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase was primarily due to an $8.2 million increase in employee-related costs associated with our increased headcount from 157 employees as of December 31, 2015 to 182 employees as of December 31, 2016. The remaining increase was principally the result of a $0.5 million increase in trade show and advertising costs and a $0.2 million increase in software costs to support our sales organization.\nResearch and Development Expense\n\nResearch and development expense increased by $3.2 million in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase was primarily due to a $2.7 million increase in employee-related costs associated with our increased headcount from 109 employees as of December 31, 2015 to 123 employees as of December 31, 2016. The remaining increase was principally the result of a $0.6 million increase for the use of outside consultants and a $0.5 million increase in hosting and software related cost to support research and development activities. A total of $5.5 million of internally-developed software costs during 2016 and $4.8 million of internally-developed software costs during 2015 were capitalized, resulting in a decrease of the expense by $0.7 million in 2016.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\n\nGeneral and administrative expense increased by $2.0 million in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase was primarily due to a $2.0 million increase in employee-related costs associated with our increased headcount from 62 employees as of December 31, 2015 to 64 employees as of December 31, 2016. There was an additional increase of $0.4 million to support our operations and our preparations to become a public company. These increases were offset by a $0.6 million decrease in professional fees due to a decrease in legal, accounting and audit services in 2016.\nOther Expense, Net\n\nOther expense, net decreased by $0.1 million in 2016 compared to 2015 as a result of a decrease in interest expense related to interest expense due under our term loan and revolving line of credit, which were paid off in September 2016 with the proceeds of our IPO.\nIncome Taxes\n\nBenefit from income taxes decreased by $0.5 million in 2016 compared to 2015 due to the placement of a full valuation allowance on our foreign deferred taxes.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nRevenue\n\nRevenue increased by $16.3 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase was primarily due to a $14.0 million increase in sales of our solutions driven by expansion of our customer base from 2,167 customers as of December 31, 2014 to 2,662 as of December 31, 2015, including increased sales to larger organizations with greater numbers of contacts and locations. In 2015, we also had a $2.3 million increase in revenue attributable to the acquisition of Nixle, which occurred in December 2014.\nCost of Revenue\n\nCost of revenue increased by $7.7 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase was primarily due to a $2.7 million increase in employee-related costs associated with our increased headcount from 72 employees as of December 31, 2014 to 90 employees as of December 31, 2015. The remaining increase was principally the result of a $2.8 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense attributable to our acquired intangible assets, a $1.8 million increase in hosting and messaging costs and a $0.3 million increase in office related expenses.\nGross margin percentage decreased due to an increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets and capitalized software, as well as our continued investment in personnel to support our growth.\nOperating Expenses\nSales and Marketing Expense\n\nSales and marketing expense increased by $10.1 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase was primarily due to an $8.1 million increase in employee-related costs associated with our increased headcount from 104 employees as of December 31, 2014 to 157 employees as of December 31, 2015. The remaining increase was principally the result of a $1.1 million increase in trade show and advertising costs and a $0.9 million increase in office related costs to support sales.\nResearch and Development Expense\n\nResearch and development expense increased by $4.2 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase was primarily due to a $6.5 million increase in employee-related costs associated with our increased headcount from 83 employees as of December 31, 2014 to 109 employees as of December 31, 2015. The remaining increase was principally the result of a $0.9 million increase in office and software related cost to support research and development activities. A total of $4.8 million of internally-developed software costs during 2015 and $1.6 million of internally-developed software costs during 2014 were capitalized, resulting in a reduction of the expense by $3.2 million in 2015.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\n\nGeneral and administrative expense increased by $4.8 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase was primarily due to a $2.5 million increase in employee-related costs associated with our increased headcount from 44 employees as of December 31, 2014 to 62 employees as of December 31, 2015. The remaining increase was the result of a $1.7 million increase in professional fees due to increased legal, accounting and audit services to support our operations and our preparations to become a public company, a $0.4 million increase in office related expenses and a $0.4 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense related to equipment. These increases were offset by a $0.2 million decrease in legal and transaction-related costs in 2015.\nOther Expense, Net\n\nOther expense, net increased by $0.2 million in 2015 compared to 2014 as a result of increased interest expense related to accretion of interest on our notes payable, interest expense due under our term loan and revolving line of credit.\nIncome Taxes\n\nBenefit from income taxes increased by $0.5 million in 2015 compared to 2014 due to our increased operations in foreign jurisdictions where we are subject to income taxes on profits which have benefited from current losses.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nTo date, we have financed our operations primarily through cash from operating activities, along with equity issuances and debt financing arrangements. Our principal source of liquidity is cash and cash equivalents totaling $60.8 million as of December 31, 2016, which includes the remaining net proceeds from our initial public offering completed in September 2016. We received net proceeds of $66.1 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses paid or payable by us. We have generated significant losses since inception and expect to continue to generate losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe believe that our cash balances, our available borrowings under our revolving line of credit and the cash flows generated by our operations will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. However, our belief may prove to be incorrect, and we could utilize our available financial resources sooner than we currently expect. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including those set forth in the section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K titled Risk Factors.\u201d We cannot assure you that we will be able to raise additional capital on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, if we fail to meet our operating plan during the next 12 months, our liquidity could be adversely affected.\nCash Flows\nThe following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\n\nAt December 31, 2016, $1.5 million of the $60.8 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by foreign subsidiaries. Our intention is to indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings in our foreign subsidiaries. If these earnings were used to fund domestic operations, they would be subject to additional income taxes upon repatriation.\nSources of Funds\nInitial Public Offering\nOn September 21, 2016, we closed our initial public offering in which we issued and sold 6,250,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $12.00 per share for net proceeds of approximately $66.1 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses paid or payable by us.\nCredit Facility\nIn June 2015, we entered into a loan and security agreement with Western Alliance Bank (formerly known as Bridge Bank) to provide a secured revolving line of credit that allows us to borrow up to $10.0 million for working capital and general business requirements. In February 2016, we entered into an amendment of our loan and security agreement with Western Alliance Bank to (1) increase the capacity of our revolving line of credit by $5.0 million to $15.0 million and (2) set the minimum prime rate based on which interest due is calculated at 3.25%. No other changes were made to the loan and security agreement. The loan and security agreement, as amended, allows us to borrow up to $15.0 million for working capital and general business requirements. Amounts outstanding under the line of credit bear interest at the prime rate plus 0.75% with accrued interest payable on a monthly basis and outstanding and unpaid principal due upon maturity of the credit facility in June 2018. As of December 31, 2016, the total amount available to be borrowed by us was $15.0 million and we had no outstanding balance on the revolving line of credit.\nWestern Alliance Bank maintains a security interest in substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets, excluding intellectual property, to secure any outstanding amounts under the loan agreement. The loan agreement contains customary events of default, conditions to borrowing and covenants, including restrictions on our ability to dispose of assets, make acquisitions, incur debt, incur liens and make distributions and dividends to stockholders. The loan agreement also includes a financial covenant related to our recurring revenue renewal rate. During the continuance of an event of default, Western Alliance Bank may accelerate amounts outstanding, terminate the credit facility and foreclose on the collateral.\nUses of Funds\nOur historical uses of cash have primarily consisted of cash used for operating activities, such as expansion of our sales and marketing operations, research and development activities and other working capital needs.\nOperating Activities\nOur net loss and cash flows provided by operating activities are significantly influenced by our investments in headcount and infrastructure to support our growth, marketing and sponsorship expenses, and our ability to bill and collect in a timely manner. Our net loss has been significantly greater than our use of cash for operating activities due to the inclusion of non-cash expenses and charges.\nOperating activities provided $9.5 million in 2016, primarily from $9.6 million in cash provided as a result of changes in operating assets and liabilities, which was increased by $11.2 million of non-cash operating expenses and partially offset by our net loss of $11.3 million. Specifically, we recognized non-cash charges aggregating $7.7 million for depreciation and amortization of intangible assets, capitalized software development costs and property and equipment, $3.1 million for stock-based compensation expense, $0.4 million for the increase in our accounts receivable provision and $0.1 million related to non-cash interest on notes payable, offset by a $0.1 million decrease in our deferred income taxes. The change in operating assets and liabilities reflected a $12.0 million increase in deferred revenue, a $1.3 million increase in accrued employee-related expenses due to timing of payments, and a $0.5 million increase in accrued expenses due to timing of payments made to vendors. These increases were partially offset by a $2.3 million increase in accounts receivable, a $1.1 million increase in other assets due to timing of payments made for deferred IPO cost and commissions, a $0.4 million decrease in accounts payable due to the timing of payments made and a $0.3 million increase in prepaid expenses as a result of the increase in upfront payments made for insurance services.\nOperating activities provided $4.5 million in 2015, primarily from $7.7 million in cash provided as a result of changes in operating assets and liabilities, which was increased by $7.5 million of non-cash operating expenses and partially offset by our net loss of $10.8 million. Specifically, we recognized non-cash charges aggregating $6.0 million for depreciation and amortization of intangible assets, capitalized software development costs and property and equipment, $1.5 million for stock-based compensation expense, $0.4 million for the increase in our accounts receivable provision and $0.1 million related to non-cash interest on notes payable, offset by a $0.4 million decrease in our deferred income taxes. The change in operating assets and liabilities reflected an $11.6 million increase in deferred revenue, a $1.2 million increase in accrued employee-related expenses due to timing of payments and a $0.9 million increase in accounts payable due to timing of payments made to vendors. These increases were partially offset by a $4.8 million increase in accounts receivable, a $0.7 million increase in prepaid expenses as a result of the increase in upfront payments made for insurance services, a $0.4 million increase in other assets due to timing of payments made for deferred IPO cost and commissions and a $0.2 million decrease in accrued expenses due to the timing of payments made.\nInvesting Activities\nOur investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures for capitalized software development costs and property and equipment purchases.\nInvesting activities used $9.0 million in 2016, primarily from net cash paid in acquisitions of $2.3 million, and our investment in software development of $5.5 million and property and equipment of $1.0 million.\nInvesting activities used $7.4 million in cash in 2015, primarily from our investment in software development of $4.9 million and property and equipment of $2.5 million.\nFinancing Activities\nCash generated by financing activities includes proceeds from our initial public offering, borrowings under our term loan and credit facilities and proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of employee stock options. Cash used in financing activities includes deferred initial public offering costs and payments on capital leases, notes payable and repayments of debt under our credit facilities.\nFinancing activities provided $51.5 million of cash in 2016, which reflects proceeds of $67.8 million from our initial public offering, net of underwriter's discount and commissions, $0.8 million from the exercise of stock options and proceeds from our line of credit of $9.5 million. These amounts were offset by a $19.5 million payment on our line of credit, a $5.0 million payment on our term loan and a $2.0 million payment on notes payable related to the Vocal Limited acquisition.\nFinancing activities provided $7.2 million in cash in 2015, primarily from proceeds from our term loan of $5.0 million and proceeds from our line of credit of $12.0 million, partially offset by a $1.5 million payment to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock, $5.0 million in payments on our line of credit, $1.8 million in payments on notes payable, $1.4 million in payments attributed to deferred initial public offering costs and $0.1 million in payments on capital leases.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our commitments to settle contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016:\n\n (1) Operating leases include total future minimum rent payments under non-cancelable operating lease agreements as described in note (18) of our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nFuture minimum operating lease payments have been reduced by future minimum sublease income of $0.2 million.\nIn December 2016, we entered into a new lease for our executive offices in Burlington, Massachusetts that will increase our future minimum lease commitments over the next five years by $8.0 million.\nThe above table does not include any payments we may have to make under the contingent liability related to the Crisis Commander and IDV acquisitions, as the amount of the ultimate payments are unknown. Please see Note 5 and 19 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information.\nThe commitment amounts in the table above are associated with contracts that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum services to be used, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the actions under the contracts. The table does not include obligations under agreements that we can cancel without a significant penalty.\nBacklog\nWe sell all of our critical communications applications on a subscription basis. We generally enter into contracts that range from one to three years in length, with an average contract duration of 2.0 years as of December 31, 2016, and generally bill and collect payment annually in advance. Since we bill many of our customers at the beginning of each contract year, there can be amounts that we have not yet been contractually able to invoice. Until such time as these amounts are invoiced, they are not recorded in revenue, deferred revenue or elsewhere in our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2016, the dollar amount of this backlog believed to be firm was $39.3 million. We expect that the amount of backlog relative to the total value of our subscription agreements will change from year to year for several reasons, including the specific timing and duration of customer agreements, varying invoicing cycles of agreements, the specific timing of customer renewals and changes in customer financial circumstances. In addition, because revenue for any period is a function of revenue recognized from deferred revenue under contracts in existence at the beginning of the period, as well as contracts that are renewed and new customer contracts that are entered into during the period, backlog at the beginning of any period is not necessarily indicative of future performance. Our presentation of backlog may also differ from that of other companies in our industry. Due to these factors, as well as variances in billing arrangements with customers, we do not utilize backlog as a key management metric internally.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including entities sometimes referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities that were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. In addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements require us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenue, assets, liabilities, costs and expenses. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. Our most critical accounting policies are summarized below.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from contract subscription fees for use of our applications.\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, with respect to a transaction when all of the following conditions have been satisfied:\n \u2022 persuasive evidence of an agreement exists; \n \u2022 the service has been provided to the customer; \n \u2022 fees are fixed or determinable; and \n \u2022 the collection of the fees is reasonably assured and acceptance criteria, if any, have been met. \nIf any of these criteria are not met, revenue recognition is deferred until such time that all of the criteria are met.\nOur subscription arrangements do not provide customers with the right to take possession of our software at any time.\nSubscription Revenue\nWe recognize subscription revenue ratably over the initial subscription period committed by the customer commencing when the customer's environment has been created in our hosted environment. The initial subscription period is typically one to three years and the level of service provided each customer varies based on the level of service required by the complexity of a customer's business.\nOther Revenue\nWe recognize revenue for set-up fees, which historically have not been material to our financial statements. We have concluded that set-up fees do not meet the criteria for separation from our primary service as they do not have stand-alone value as we have historically not sold set-up fees separately. We charge set-up fees for substantially all new applications and services. These set-up fees are recognized ratably over the contractual period, which approximates the life of the application. We also sell professional services, which have been immaterial to date.\nDeferred Revenue\nDeferred revenue includes amounts collected or billed in excess of recognizable revenue. Such amounts are recognized by us over the life of the contract upon meeting the revenue recognition criteria. Deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding 12-month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as non-current deferred revenue. Because the mix of billing terms with customers can vary from period to period, the annualized value of the contracts that we enter into with our customers will not be completely reflected in deferred revenue at any single point in time.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe results of businesses acquired in a business combination are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition. Purchase accounting results in assets and liabilities of an acquired business being recorded at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. Any excess consideration over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill.\nWe perform valuations of assets acquired and liabilities assumed on each acquisition accounted for as a business combination and allocate the purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on our best estimate of fair value. We determine the appropriate useful life of intangible assets by performing an analysis of cash flows based on historical experience of the acquired businesses. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives based on the pattern in which the economic benefits associated with the asset are expected to be consumed, which to date has approximated the straight-line method of amortization.\nTransaction costs associated with business combinations are expensed as incurred and are included in general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired in our business combinations. Goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Events or changes in circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include a significant adverse change in business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business, significant negative industry or economic trends, or significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future results of operations.\nWe have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, including goodwill. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, additional impairment testing is not required. However, if we conclude otherwise, we are required to perform the first step of a two-step impairment test. Alternatively, we may elect to proceed directly to the first step of the two-step impairment test and bypass the qualitative assessment.\nThe first step of the impairment test involves comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its book value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value exceeds book value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary. If, however, the fair value of the reporting unit is less than book value, the carrying amount of the goodwill is compared to its implied fair value. The estimate of implied fair value of goodwill may require valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess. We test for goodwill impairment on November 30 of each year.\nSoftware Development Costs\nWe capitalize the costs of software developed or obtained for internal use in accordance with ASC Topic 350-40, Internal Use Software. Capitalized software development costs consist of costs incurred during the application development stage and include purchased software licenses, implementation costs, consulting costs, and payroll-related costs for projects that qualify for capitalization. These costs relate to major new functionality. All other costs, primarily related to maintenance and minor software fixes, are expensed as incurred.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe recognize stock-based compensation expense for stock-based compensation awards granted to our employees, directors, consultants and other service providers that can be settled in shares of our common stock. Compensation expense for stock-based compensation awards granted is based on the grant date fair value estimate for each award as determined by our board of directors or the compensation committee of our board of directors. We recognize these compensation costs on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally four years. As stock-based compensation expense recognized is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, such expense is reduced for estimated forfeitures.\nWe estimate the fair value of stock-based compensation awards at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which was developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are freely transferable. The fair values generated by the model may not be indicative of the actual fair values of our awards as it does not consider other factors important to those stock-based payment awards, such as continued employment, periodic vesting requirements and limited transferability.\nDetermining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options. The determination of the grant date fair value of options using an option-pricing model is affected by our estimated common stock fair value as well as assumptions regarding a number of other complex and subjective variables. These variables include the fair value of our common stock, the expected term of the options, our expected stock price volatility, risk-free interest rates, and expected dividends, which are estimated as follows:\n \u2022 Fair value of our common stock. Prior to our initial public offering, the fair value of our common stock was determined by the estimated fair value at the time of grant. For stock options granted subsequent to our initial public offering, the fair value of common stock is based on the closing market price of our common stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Market on the date of grant. \n \u2022 Expected term. The expected term represents the period that the stock-based compensation awards are expected to be outstanding. Since we did not have sufficient historical information to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise behavior, we use the simplified method to compute expected term, which represents the average of the time-to-vesting and the contractual life. \n \u2022 Expected volatility. As we have a limited trading history for our common stock, the expected stock price volatility for our common stock is estimated by taking the average historic price volatility for industry peers based on daily price observations over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock option grants. We do not rely on implied volatilities of traded options in our industry peers' common stock because the volume of activity was relatively low. We intend to continue to consistently apply this process using the same or similar public companies until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own common stock share price becomes available. \n \u2022 Risk-free interest rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for zero coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to the expected term of the options. \n \u2022 Expected dividend yield. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not presently plan to declare or pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we used an expected dividend yield of zero. \nIf any of the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model change significantly, stock-based compensation for future awards may differ materially compared with the awards granted previously.\nThe following table presents the weighted-average assumptions used to estimate the fair value of options granted during the periods presented:\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. This guidance eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test, instead requiring an entity to recognize a goodwill impairment charge for the amount by which the goodwill carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. This guidance is effective for interim and annual goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and early adoption is permitted. This guidance must be applied on a prospective basis. We expect to adopt this guidance for interim and annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business. This guidance narrows the definition of a business. This standard provides guidance to assist entities with evaluating when a set of transferred assets and activities is a business. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. This guidance must be applied prospectively to transactions occurring within the period of adoption. We expect to adopt this guidance effective January 1, 2018. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash. This guidance requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. As a result, restricted cash will be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, and the new guidance is to be applied retrospectively. We not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our cash flows.\nIn September 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. This guidance clarifies the presentation requirements of eight specific issues within the statement of cash flows. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial statements, as our treatment of the relevant affected items within its consolidated statement of cash flows is consistent with the requirements of this guidance.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. This standard is intended to simplify several areas of accounting for share-based compensation arrangements, including the income tax impact, classification on the statement of cash flows and forfeitures. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted. The ASU will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2017. We do not expect this ASU to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. The standard will affect all entities that lease assets and will require lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases (except for short-term leases that have a duration of less than one year) as of the date on which the lessor makes the underlying asset available to the lessee. For public companies, the new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. For leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, lessees and lessors must apply a modified retrospective transition approach. We are still evaluating the effect that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. The new standard requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. The new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. We adopted this standard retrospectively in the first quarter of 2016. The balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 was retrospectively adjusted, which resulted in reductions to other assets of $0.1 million and long-term debt of $0.1 million.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, which delays the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. The FASB also agreed to allow entities to choose to adopt the standard as of the original effective date. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. The guidance includes indicators to assist an entity in determining whether it controls a specified good or service before it is transferred to the customers. The new revenue recognition standard will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2018, with the option to adopt it in the first quarter of 2017. We currently anticipate adopting the new standard effective January 1, 2018. The new standard also permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method), or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (the modified retrospective method). We currently anticipate adopting the standard using the modified retrospective method. We are still in the process of completing our analysis on the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.", "item_7_tables": "Table 201: <table>
