Each quarterly period has 13 weeks, except for a 53 week year, when the fourth quarter has 14 weeks. The fiscal years ended December 29, 2019, December 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 each consisted of 52 weeks. References to 2019, 2018 and 2017 are for the fiscal years ended December 29, 2019, December 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.\nExecutive Summary\nGeneral\nWe develop, operate and franchise family entertainment and dining centers (also referred to as venues\u201d) under the names Chuck E. Cheese\u201d ( Where A Kid Can Be A Kid\u201d) and Peter Piper Pizza\u201d ( Pizza Made Fresh, Families Made Happy\u201d). Our venues deliver a lively, kid-friendly atmosphere that feature a broad array of entertainment offerings including arcade-style and skill-oriented games, rides, live entertainment shows, and other attractions, with the opportunity for kids to win tickets that they can redeem for prizes. We combine this memorable entertainment experience with a broad and creative menu that combines kid-friendly classics as well as a new selection of sophisticated options for adults. We operate 555 venues and have an additional 186 venues operating under franchise arrangements, for a total of 741 system-wide venues across 47 states and 16 foreign countries and territories as of December 29, 2019.\nThe following table summarizes information regarding the number of system-wide Company-operated and franchised venues for the periods presented:\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Twelve Months Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of Company-operated venues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Beginning of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>554\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>562\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>559\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquired from franchisee\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Closed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>End of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>555\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>554\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>562\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of franchised venues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Beginning of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>188\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquired from franchisee\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Closed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>End of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>192\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total number of system-wide venues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Beginning of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>754\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>747\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> New\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Closed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>End of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>741\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>754\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________________\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>The number of new and closed Company-operated and Total system-wide venues during 2018 includes one venue that was relocated.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Our Strategic Plan\nOur strategic objectives are focused on becoming the world's leading family friendly entertainment restaurant brands\u201d by entertaining and inspiring kids around the world and being the best place for everyday family fun, directed by premier brands and a commitment to ensuring that every guest is happy. This strategic plan is centered on the following six growth pillars: (i) increase traffic to our venues through marketing and sales promotions; (ii) drive in-store guest spending;(iii) pursue a programmatic approach to our domestic remodel program; (iv) expand the global franchise network; (v) launch a division to focus on entertainment & licensing efforts; and (vi) increase efficiencies and lower operating costs with tight controls. See discussion of our strategic plan included in Part I, Item 1. Business - Our Strategic Plan.\u201d\nKey Measures of Our Financial Performance and Key Non-GAAP Measures\nComparable venue sales. We define comparable venue sales\u201d as the sales for our domestic Company-operated venues that have been open for more than 18 months as of the beginning of each respective fiscal year or for acquired venues we have operated for at least 12 months as of the beginning of each respective fiscal year. Comparable venue sales excludes sales for our domestic Company-operated venues that are expected to be temporarily closed for more than three months primarily as a result of natural disasters, fires, floods and property damage. Company-operated venues that were temporarily closed for more than three months are included in comparable venue sales once the venues have been reopened for at least 12 months as of the beginning of each respective fiscal year. We define comparable venue sales change\u201d as the percentage change in comparable venue sales for each respective fiscal year. We believe comparable venue sales change to be a key performance indicator used within our industry; it is a critical factor when evaluating our performance, as it is indicative of acceptance of our strategic initiatives and local economic and consumer trends.\nAverage Sales per Comparable Venue. Average sales per comparable venue is calculated based on the average annual sales of our comparable venue base. Average sales per comparable venue cannot be used to compute year-over year comparable venue sales increases or decreases due to the change in the comparable venue base.\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 29, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands, except venue number amounts)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average sales per comparable venue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,587\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of venues included in our comparable venue base\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>529\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>531\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted EBITDA and Margin. We define Adjusted EBITDA, a measure used by management to assess operating performance, as net income (loss) plus interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization expense, impairments, gains and losses on asset disposals, and stock based compensation. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA excludes other items we consider unusual or non-recurring and other adjustments required or permitted in calculating covenant compliance under the indenture governing our Senior Notes and/or secured credit facilities. Adjusted EBITDA Margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenues.\nKey Income Statement Line Item Descriptions\nRevenues. Our primary source of revenues is sales at our Company-operated venues ( company venue sales\u201d), which consist of the sale of food, beverages, game-play credits, unlimited game-play time blocks, and merchandise. A portion of our company venue sales are from sales of value-priced combination packages generally comprised of food and beverage only ( Package Deals\u201d), with game plays and/or time blocks available for purchase separately. We promote these offerings through in-venue menu pricing, our website and coupon offerings. Through the second quarter of 2018, we offered value-priced combination packages generally comprised of food, beverage, game plays and/or time blocks. We allocated the revenues recognized from the sale of these combination packages and coupons between Food and beverage sales\u201d and Entertainment and merchandise sales\u201d based upon the price charged for each component when it was sold separately, or in limited circumstances, our best estimate of selling price if a component was not sold on a stand-alone basis, which we believe approximates each component's fair value.\nFood and beverage sales include all revenues recognized with respect to stand-alone food and beverage sales, and through the end of the second quarter of 2018, the portion of revenues allocated from combination packages and coupons that relate to food and beverage sales. Entertainment and merchandise sales include all revenues recognized with respect to stand-alone sales of game-play credits and unlimited game-play time blocks, and through the end of the second quarter of 2018, a portion of revenues allocated from combination packages and coupons that relate to entertainment and merchandise.\nFranchise fees and royalties are another source of revenues. We earn monthly royalties from our franchisees based on a percentage of each franchise venue's sales. We also receive development and initial franchise fees to establish new franchised venues, as well as earn revenues from the sale of equipment and other items or services to franchisees. Effective January 1, 2018, with the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-10 Revenues from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ( ASU 606\u201d), we recognize initial and renewal development and franchise fees as revenues on a straight-line basis over the life of the franchise agreement starting when the franchise venue has opened. Prior to the adoption of ASU 6060, we recognized development and franchise fees as revenues when the franchise venue had opened and we had substantially completed our obligations to the franchisee relating to the opening of a venue. In addition, our national advertising fund receipts from members of the Association are now accounted for on a gross basis as revenue from franchisees, when prior to the adoption of ASU 606 they had been netted against advertising expense.\nCompany venue operating costs. Certain of our costs and expenses relate only to the operation of our Company-operated venues. These costs and expenses are listed and described below:\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Cost of food and beverage includes all direct costs of food, beverages and costs of related paper and birthday supplies, less rebates from suppliers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Cost of entertainment and merchandise includes all direct costs of tickets issued, stored-value Play Pass and AYCP cards, prizes provided and merchandise sold to our customers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Labor expenses consist of salaries and wages, bonuses, related payroll taxes and benefits for venue personnel;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Lease costs include lease costs for Company-operated venues and, effective the first day of Fiscal 2019, in connection with the adoption of a new lease accounting standard, lease costs include common area maintenance ( CAM\u201d) charges; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Other venue operating expenses primarily include utilities, repair and maintenance costs, liability and property insurance, property taxes, credit card processing fees, licenses, preopening expenses, venue asset disposal gains and losses, CAM charges (through the end of Fiscal 2018 as discussed under Lease costs above), and all other costs directly related to the operation of a venue.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Cost of food and beverage\u201d and Cost of entertainment and merchandise\u201d, as a percentage of company venue sales, are influenced both by the cost of products and the overall mix of our Package Deals and coupon offerings. Entertainment and merchandise sales\u201d have higher margins than Food and beverage sales.\u201d\nAdvertising expense. Advertising expense includes production costs for television commercials, newspaper inserts, Internet advertising, coupons, media expenses for national and local advertising, consulting fees and other forms of advertising such as social media. Historically, prior to the adoption of ASU 606 on January 1, 2018, advertising expense was partially offset by contributions from our franchisees. Contributions from franchisees are now recognized as revenue from franchisees.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses represent all costs associated with operating our corporate office, including regional and district management and corporate personnel payroll and benefits, back-office support systems, costs of outsourced functions, and other administrative costs not directly related to the operation of our Company-operated venues.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization includes expenses that are (i) directly related to our Company-operated venues' property and equipment, including leasehold improvements, game and ride equipment, furniture, fixtures and other equipment, and (ii) depreciation and amortization of corporate assets and intangibles.\nAsset impairments. Asset impairments represent non-cash charges to reduce the carrying amount of certain long-lived assets within our venues to their estimated fair value, when a venue's operation is not expected to generate sufficient projected future cash flows to recover the current net book value of the long-lived assets within the venue. We believe our assumptions in calculating the fair value of our long-lived assets are similar to those used by other marketplace participants.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes

The increase in Company venue sales was primarily attributable to a 2.7% increase in comparable venue sales, partially offset by a $2.6 million decrease in Company venue sales from our non-comparable venues primarily due to a net reduction of seven Company-operated venues over the last two years. In addition, net revenue deferrals related to Play Pass and unredeemed tickets were $0.1 million for 2019 compared to $6.6 million in net revenue breakage for 2018, which further offset the increase in comparable venue sales.\nFranchise fees and royalties increased from $20.7 million to $22.8 million primarily due to a net increase in average franchise locations during Fiscal 2019.\nCompany Venue Operating Costs\nThe cost of food, beverage, entertainment and merchandise, as a percentage of Total company venue sales, was 14.8% and 15.0% for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively.\nThe cost of food and beverage as a percentage of food and beverage sales, was 23.2% and 23.8% for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively. The decrease in the cost of food and beverage on a percentage basis in 2019 was driven by an increase in average selling prices and favorability in commodities volume, primarily related to cheese, pizza dough and chicken wings compared to 2018.\nThe cost of entertainment and merchandise, as a percentage of Entertainment and merchandise sales, was 8.2% and 7.7% for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively. The cost of entertainment and merchandise, as a percentage of Entertainment and merchandise in 2019 compared to 2018 reflects a combination of the impact of AYCP and More Tickets, which were launched nationally during the third quarter of 2018.\nGross profit, which represents Total revenues less Total cost of food, beverage, entertainment and merchandise, as a percentage of Total revenues, was 85.6% and 85.4% for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively.\nLabor expenses, as a percentage of Total company venue sales, were 29.6% and 29.3% for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively, as wage pressures exceeded the favorable impact of a decrease in labor hours on higher sales. Our sales per labor hour improved approximately 4.8% in 2019 from 2018.\nLease costs, as a percentage of sales, were 12.3% and 11.0%, for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively. Lease costs for Fiscal 2019 were impacted by the adoption of a new lease standard effective December 31, 2018, the first day of Fiscal 2019, that requires us to recognize lease and non-lease components, such as CAM charges, as lease costs, rather than reflecting CAM charges as Other venue operating expenses. Excluding CAM charges, Lease costs, as a percentage of sales, would have been 10.7% for Fiscal 2019, reflecting an increase in Company venue sales.\nOther venue operating expenses, as a percentage of Total company venue sales, were 15.1% and 17.2% for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively. Other venue operating expenses for 2019 were impacted by the adoption of a new lease standard, as discussed in the previous paragraph under Lease costs. Other venue operating expenses as a percentage of sales, including the impact of CAM charges, would have been 16.7% for 2019, reflecting savings initiatives and efficiencies in general operating costs. In addition, Other venue operating expenses for Fiscal 2018 included expenses related to the production and deployment of new menu boards and panels in connection with the launch of AYCP. These favorable impacts were partially offset by an increase in bank and credit card service fees, as the percentage of credit card sales increased in 2019 from 2018.\nAdvertising Expense\nAdvertising expense was $44.7 million and $48.2 million for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively, due to a shift in our marketing strategy away from television and print advertising to targeted digital and social media platforms.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $57.0 million and $54.9 million for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively. The increase in General and administrative expenses in 2019 is primarily due to an increase in performance-based compensation as a result of improved operating results, and an increase in labor related litigation.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization was $97.6 million and $100.7 million for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively. The decrease in depreciation and amortization is primarily due to a decrease in the average number of Company-operated venues over the last two years as a result of venue closures and non-cash venue impairments recorded in 2019 and 2018.\nTransaction, Severance and Related Litigation Costs\nTransaction, severance and related litigation costs were $0.8 million and $0.5 million for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively. The Transaction, severance and related litigation costs for 2019 relate to $0.4 million in professional and legal fees incurred in connection with the refinancing of our senior secured facilities and $0.4 million in legal fees incurred primarily in connection with certain potential transactions which the Company did not pursue. See further discussion of the refinancing of our senior secured facilities in Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt Financing\u201d of this report. The Transaction, severance and related litigation costs for 2018 relate to $0.3 million in legal fees incurred in connection with Merger related litigation, and severance payments of $0.2 million.\nAsset Impairments\nIn Fiscal 2019, we recognized an asset impairment charge of $23.3 million primarily related to 16 venues, of which none were previously impaired. In Fiscal 2018 we recognized an asset impairment charge of $6.9 million primarily related to eight venues, of which one was previously impaired. We continue to operate all but two of the venues that were impaired in 2019 and all but three of the venues that were impaired in 2018. The impairment charges were based on the determination that the financial performance of these venues was adversely impacted by various competitive and economic factors in the markets in which the venues are located.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $87.2 million and $76.3 million for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively. The increase in interest expense is related to an increase in the weighted average effective rate incurred on our borrowings under both our 2019 and 2014 Secured Credit Facilities, driven by the higher interest margin on our recently refinanced secured credit facilities and increases in LIBOR rates. The weighted average effective interest rate incurred on our borrowings under our secured credit facilities and Senior Notes (including amortized debt issuance costs, amortization of original issue discount, commitment and other fees related to the Secured Credit Facilities and Senior Notes, but excluding the net loss on extinguishment of debt and $0.4 million of transaction costs expensed in Fiscal 2019 relating to the 2019 Secured Credit Facilities) was 7.5% and 6.4% for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively. See further discussion of the refinancing of our senior secured facilities in Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt Financing\u201d of this report.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nIn Fiscal 2019 we recognized a Loss on Extinguishment of Debt of $2.2 million. The Loss on Extinguishment of Debt reflects a $2.9 million loss in connection with the refinancing of our 2014 Secured Credit Facilities, partially offset by a $0.7 million gain on the repurchase of $39.3 million of our outstanding Senior Notes in the open market. See further discussion of the refinancing of our senior secured facilities and the repurchase of Senior Notes in Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt Financing\u201d of this report.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective income tax rates for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018 were 26.4% and 16.9%, respectively (where the effective income tax rate for Fiscal 2018 excludes adjustments recorded in that year in relation to the provisional estimate made in Fiscal 2017 to account for the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the TCJA\u201d) pursuant to Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d) issued by the SEC staff on December 22, 2017).\nOur effective income tax rate for Fiscal 2019 was favorably impacted by employment-related federal income tax credits, offset by the following:\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(i)\n</td> <td>nondeductible penalties and other expenses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(ii)\n</td> <td>state income taxes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(iii)\n</td> <td>foreign income taxes withheld (not offset by foreign tax credits due to the foreign tax credit limitation);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(iv)\n</td> <td>accruals for uncertain tax positions; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(v)\n</td> <td>an increase in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets associated with a carryforward of state tax credits that are more than likely to expire before utilized.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur effective income tax rate for Fiscal 2018 was favorably impacted by employment-related federal income tax credits, offset by the following:\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(i)\n</td> <td>nondeductible litigation costs related to the Merger;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(ii)\n</td> <td>nondeductible penalties and other expenses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(iii)\n</td> <td>state income taxes including an increase in our state income tax expense caused by state tax legislation enacted during the second quarter that increased the amount of income subject to state taxation;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(iv)\n</td> <td>foreign income taxes withheld (not offset by a foreign tax credits due to the foreign tax credit limitation);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(v)\n</td> <td>accruals for uncertain tax positions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(vi)\n</td> <td>an increase in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets associated with a carryforward of state tax credits that are more than likely to expire before utilized; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(vii)\n</td> <td>an increase in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets relating to our Canada operations that could expire before they are utilized, partially offset by a favorable one-time adjustment to deferred tax (the tax effect of the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment existing as of January 1, 2018) resulting from the change in our intent to no longer indefinitely reinvest monies previously loaned to our Canadian subsidiary recorded in the first quarter of Fiscal 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur total effective income tax rate for Fiscal 2018 was 19.7% and includes 2.8% of favorable adjustments to the provisional estimate provided in Fiscal 2017 to account for the impact of the TCJA pursuant to SAB 118. Pursuant to SAB 118, we included a provisional estimate of $66.6 million tax benefit in our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, relating to the enactment of TJCA, which primarily related to the re-measurement of our deferred tax liability. In the second quarter of Fiscal 2018, we recorded an adjustment to the provisional estimate of $0.2 million tax benefit, in the third quarter of Fiscal 2018, we recorded an incremental adjustment to the provisional estimate of $0.5 million tax benefit. The measurement period relating to the enactment of the TCJA ended during our fourth quarter, and the tax effects thereof were completed as of the end of Fiscal 2018.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview of Liquidity\nWe finance our business activities through cash flows provided by our operations.\nThe primary components of working capital are as follows:\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our guests pay for their purchases in cash or credit cards at the time of the sale and the cash from these sales is typically received before our related accounts payable to suppliers and employee payroll becomes due;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>frequent inventory turnover results in a limited investment required in inventories; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our accounts payable cash management strategies.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> As a result of these factors, our requirement for working capital is not significant and we are able to operate with a net working capital deficit (current liabilities in excess of current assets), similar to other companies in the restaurant industry. As part of our capital allocation strategy, we may elect from time to time to retire certain of our debt obligations through voluntary prepayments or open market purchases.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nThe following tables present summarized consolidated financial information that we believe is helpful in evaluating our liquidity and capital resources as of the periods presented:\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>111,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86,790\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>104,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(87,584\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(79,284\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(93,712\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(52,088\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,547\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,030\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>466\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(28,532\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,991\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash paid for interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77,315\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72,966\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64,675\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash paid (refunded) for income taxes, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7,264\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>151\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Available unused commitments under Revolving Credit Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>105,538\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>141,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and available unused commitments under the revolving credit facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>140,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>204,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term loan facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>760,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>723,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>215,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>255,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFunds generated by our operating activities and available cash and cash equivalents continue to be our primary sources of liquidity. We believe these sources of liquidity will be sufficient to finance our strategic plan and capital initiatives for the next twelve months. However, in the event of a material decline in our sales trends or operating margins, there can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flows at or above our current levels. Our revolving credit facility is also available for additional working capital needs and investment opportunities. Our ability to access our revolving credit facility is subject to our compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit agreement governing such facility, including our compliance with certain prescribed covenants, as more fully described below.\nWe monitor the capital markets and our capital structure and make changes from time to time, with the goal of maintaining financial flexibility, preserving or improving liquidity and/or achieving cost efficiency. From time to time we may opportunistically pursue financing transactions or asset sales. In addition, we may elect to repurchase amounts of our outstanding debt, including the Senior Notes (as defined below under Debt Financing - Senior Unsecured Debt\u201d), for cash, through open market repurchases or privately negotiated transactions with certain of our debt holders, although there is no assurance we will do so.\nAs of December 29, 2019, we had no borrowings outstanding and an $8.5 million of letter of credit issued but undrawn under our revolving credit facility, leaving $105.5 million in borrowing capacity under the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below under Debt Financing - Secured Credit Facilities) as of December 29, 2019. As of December 30, 2018, we had no borrowings outstanding and a $9.0 million of letter of credit issued but undrawn under our revolving credit facility leaving $141.0 million in borrowing capacity under the 2014 Senior Secured Facilities (as defined below under Debt Financing - Secured Credit Facilities\u201d).\nOur primary uses for cash provided by operating activities relate to funding our ongoing business activities, planned capital expenditures, servicing our debt, and the payment of income taxes.\nOur strategic plan does not require that we enter into any material development or contractual purchase obligations. Therefore, we have the flexibility necessary to manage our liquidity by promptly deferring or curtailing any planned capital spending.\nSources and Uses of Cash - Fiscal 2019 Compared to Fiscal 2018\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $111.1 million and $86.8 million in Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to improved results from operations, income tax refunds received and favorable fluctuations in our working capital.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $87.6 million and $79.3 million in Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities in Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018 relates primarily to capital expenditures.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $52.1 million and $11.5 million in Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively. The net cash used in financing activities for Fiscal 2019 includes (i) 39.1 million in repurchases of our outstanding Senior Notes (including accrued interest), (ii) $6.0 million in loan costs and third party legal and other professional fees paid, net of proceeds received, in connection with the refinancing of our secured credit facilities in the third quarter of 2019, (iii) principal payments on our 2014 Secured Credit Facilities, and (iv) other lease related obligations. See Debt Financing - Secured Credit Facilities below for further discussion of the refinancing of our secured credit facilities. Net cash used in financing activities in Fiscal 2018 related primarily to (i) principal payments on our 2014 Secured Credit Facilities, and (ii) other lease related obligations.\nSources and Uses of Cash - Fiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $86.8 million and $104.3 million in Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, respectively. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to an increase in our net loss, excluding the adjustment to our deferred taxes resulting from the enactment of the TCJA in Fiscal 2017, and fluctuations in working capital, partially offset by a reduction in income taxes receivable.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $79.3 million and $93.7 million in Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities in Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017 relates primarily to capital expenditures.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $11.5 million and $5.0 million in Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, respectively. The net cash used in financing activities for Fiscal 2018 related primarily to (i) principal payments on our term loan, and (ii) lease related obligations. Net cash used in financing activities for Fiscal 2017 related primarily to (i) principal payments on our term loan, and (ii) lease related obligations, partially offset by (iii) sale leaseback proceeds of $4.1 million and (iv) a $1.4 million return of capital.\nDebt Financing\nSecured Credit Facilities\nOn August 30, 2019 the Company entered into a new credit agreement and related security agreements with Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch, as administrative and collateral agent.

Our purchase obligations primarily consist of obligations for the purchase of merchandise and entertainment inventory, obligations under fixed price purchase agreements and contracts with spot\u201d market prices primarily relating to food and beverage products, obligations for the purchase of commercial airtime, and obligations associated with the modernization of various information technology platforms.

These amounts are expected to be paid in less than one year.\nThe total estimate of accrued liabilities for our self-insurance programs was $12.9 million as of December 29, 2019. We estimate that $5.0 million of these liabilities will be paid in Fiscal 2020 and the remainder paid in Fiscal 2021 and beyond. Due to the nature of the underlying liabilities and the extended period of time often experienced in resolving insurance claims, we cannot make reliable estimates of the timing of cash payments to be made in the future for our obligations related to our insurance liabilities. Therefore, no amounts for such liabilities have been included in the table above.\nAs of December 29, 2019, we had $8.5 million of letters of credit issued but undrawn under the revolving credit facility. We utilize letters of credit primarily for our self-insurance programs. These letters of credit do not represent additional obligations of the Company since the underlying liabilities are already recorded in accrued liabilities. However, if we were unable to pay insurance claims when due, our insurance carrier could draw amounts owed under the letter of credit.\nIn addition, see further discussion of our indebtedness and future debt obligations above under Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt Financing.\u201d\nWe enter into various purchase agreements in the ordinary course of business and have fixed price agreements and contracts with spot\u201d market prices primarily relating to food and beverage products. Other than the purchase obligations included in the above table, we do not have any material contracts (either individually or in the aggregate) in place committing us to a minimum or fixed level of purchases or that are cancelable subject to significant penalty.\nInflation\nOur cost of operations, including but not limited to labor, food products, supplies, utilities, financing and rental costs, can be significantly affected by inflationary factors.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of our assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements, the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The use of estimates is pervasive throughout our consolidated financial statements and is affected by management judgment and uncertainties. Our estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience, current market trends and other factors that we believe to be relevant and reasonable at the time our consolidated financial statements were prepared. We continually evaluate the information used to make these estimates as our business and the economic environment change. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nThe significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are described in Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d We consider an accounting policy or estimate to be critical if it requires difficult, subjective or complex judgments and is material to the portrayal of our consolidated financial condition, changes in financial condition or results of operations. The selection, application and disclosure of the critical accounting policies and estimates have been reviewed by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Our accounting policies and estimates that our management considers most critical are as follows:\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nThe excess of the purchase price over fair value of net identifiable assets and liabilities of an acquired business ( goodwill\u201d), trademarks, trade names and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but rather tested quantitatively and qualitatively for impairment, at least annually, and whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Events or circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, significant changes in competition, a loss of key personnel, significant changes in our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business, significant negative industry or economic trends, or significant under-performance relative to expected historical or projected future results of operations. We determined that no triggering events occurred during Fiscal 2019.\nRecoverability of the carrying value of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level. In performing a quantitative analysis, we measure the recoverability of goodwill for our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved, which is classified as a Level 3 fair value measurement. The key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model include discount rates, growth rates, tax rates, cash flow projections and terminal value rates. Discount rates, growth rates and cash flow projections are the most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment.\nWe test indefinite-lived intangible assets utilizing the relief from royalty method to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinite-lived intangible asset, which is classified as a Level 3 fair value measurement. The relief from royalty method estimates our theoretical royalty savings from ownership of the intangible asset. Key assumptions used in this model include discount rates, royalty rates, growth rates, tax rates, sales projections and terminal value rates. Discount rates, royalty rates, growth rates and sales projections are the assumptions most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment. Discount rates used are similar to the rates estimated by the weighted average cost of capital considering any differences in company-specific risk factors.\nWe tested our goodwill, trademarks, trade names and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment as of October 1, 2019. The fair value of our goodwill, trademarks, trade names and other indefinite-lived intangible assets was in excess of the carrying value as of the date of our Fiscal 2019 goodwill impairment test. No indicators of impairment were identified from the date of our impairment test through the end of Fiscal 2019.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe review our property and equipment for indicators of impairment on an ongoing basis at the lowest level of cash flows available, which is on a venue-by-venue basis, to assess if the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Such events or\nchanges may include a significant change in the business climate in a particular market area (for example, due to economic downturn or natural disaster), historical negative cash flows or plans to dispose of or sell the property and equipment before the end of its previously estimated useful life. If an event or change in circumstances occurs, we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the property and equipment and its eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected future cash flows, undiscounted and without interest, is less than the asset carrying amount (an indication that the carrying amount may not be recoverable), we may be required to recognize an impairment loss. We estimate the fair value of a venue's property and equipment by discounting the expected future cash flows of the venue over its remaining lease term using a weighted average cost of capital commensurate with the risk.\nThe following estimates and assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis impact the fair value of a venue's long-lived assets:\n\u2022discount rate based on our weighted average cost of capital and the risk-free rate of return;\n\u2022sales growth rates and cash flow margins over the expected remaining lease terms;\n\u2022strategic plans, including projected capital spending and intent to exercise renewal options, for the venue;\n\u2022salvage values; and\n\u2022other risks and qualitative factors specific to the asset or conditions in the market in which the asset is\nlocated at the time the assessment was made.\nDuring Fiscal 2019, the average discount rate, average sales growth rate and average cash flow margin growth rate used were 8.8%, 0.0% and 0.0%, respectively. We believe our assumptions in calculating the fair value of our long-lived assets are similar to those used by other marketplace participants. If actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, we may be exposed to additional impairment charges, which could be material to our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nAccounting for Leases\nThe majority of our venues are leased. With the adoption of the new Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), effective December 31, 2018, we are required to recognize lease assets and lease obligations on the balance sheet. The determination of the lease obligations requires us to estimate the present value of our future lease commitments over their reasonably assured remaining lease term using a weighted average incremental borrowing rate commensurate with the rate of interest we would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to our future lease payments in a similar economic environment. We utilized the transition method included in Leases (Topic 842): Target improvements which allowed us to apply ASU 2016-02 at the adoption date. Therefore, the presentation of financial information for periods prior to December 31, 2018 remained unchanged.\nThe terms of our venue leases vary in length from lease to lease, although a typical lease provides for an initial primary term of 10 years with two additional five year options to renew. We estimate the expected term of a lease by assuming the exercise of renewal options, in addition to the initial non-cancelable lease term, if the renewal is reasonably assured. Generally, reasonably assured\u201d relates to our contractual right to renew and the existence of an economic penalty that would preclude the abandonment of the lease at the end of the initial non-cancelable lease term. The expected term is used in the determination of our lease obligations. Additionally, the useful life of leasehold improvements is limited by the expected lease term or the economic life of the asset, whichever is shorter. If significant expenditures are made for leasehold improvements late in the expected term of a lease and renewal is reasonably assured, the useful life of the leasehold improvement is limited to the end of the reasonably assured renewal period or economic life of the asset.\nThe determination of the expected term of a lease requires us to apply judgment and estimates concerning the number of renewal periods that are reasonably assured. If a lease is terminated prior to reaching the end of the expected term, this may result in the acceleration of depreciation or impairment of a venue's long-lived assets and lease right-of-use asset.\nRecently Issued Accounting Guidance\nRefer to Note 1.

We operate 555 venues and have an additional 186 venues operating under franchise arrangements, for a total of 741 system-wide venues across 47 states and 16 foreign countries and territories as of December 29, 2019.\nThe following table summarizes information regarding the number of system-wide Company-operated and franchised venues for the periods presented:\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Twelve Months Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of Company-operated venues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Beginning of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>554\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>562\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>559\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquired from franchisee\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Closed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>End of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>555\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>554\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>562\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of franchised venues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Beginning of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>188\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquired from franchisee\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Closed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>End of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>192\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total number of system-wide venues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Beginning of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>754\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>747\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> New\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Closed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>End of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>741\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>754\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________________\n (1) The number of new and closed Company-operated and Total system-wide venues during 2018 includes one venue that was relocated.  Our Strategic Plan\nOur strategic objectives are focused on becoming the world's leading family friendly entertainment restaurant brands\u201d by entertaining and inspiring kids around the world and being the best place for everyday family fun, directed by premier brands and a commitment to ensuring that every guest is happy. This strategic plan is centered on the following six growth pillars: (i) increase traffic to our venues through marketing and sales promotions; (ii) drive in-store guest spending;(iii) pursue a programmatic approach to our domestic remodel program; (iv) expand the global franchise network; (v) launch a division to focus on entertainment & licensing efforts; and (vi) increase efficiencies and lower operating costs with tight controls. See discussion of our strategic plan included in Part I, Item 1. Business - Our Strategic Plan.\u201d\nKey Measures of Our Financial Performance and Key Non-GAAP Measures\nComparable venue sales. We define comparable venue sales\u201d as the sales for our domestic Company-operated venues that have been open for more than 18 months as of the beginning of each respective fiscal year or for acquired venues we have operated for at least 12 months as of the beginning of each respective fiscal year. Comparable venue sales excludes sales for our domestic Company-operated venues that are expected to be temporarily closed for more than three months primarily as a result of natural disasters, fires, floods and property damage. Company-operated venues that were temporarily closed for more than three months are included in comparable venue sales once the venues have been reopened for at least 12 months as of the beginning of each respective fiscal year. We define comparable venue sales change\u201d as the percentage change in comparable venue sales for each respective fiscal year. We believe comparable venue sales change to be a key performance indicator used within our industry; it is a critical factor when evaluating our performance, as it is indicative of acceptance of our strategic initiatives and local economic and consumer trends.\nAverage Sales per Comparable Venue. Average sales per comparable venue is calculated based on the average annual sales of our comparable venue base. Average sales per comparable venue cannot be used to compute year-over year comparable venue sales increases or decreases due to the change in the comparable venue base.\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 29, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands, except venue number amounts)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average sales per comparable venue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,587\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of venues included in our comparable venue base\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>529\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>531\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted EBITDA and Margin. We define Adjusted EBITDA, a measure used by management to assess operating performance, as net income (loss) plus interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization expense, impairments, gains and losses on asset disposals, and stock based compensation. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA excludes other items we consider unusual or non-recurring and other adjustments required or permitted in calculating covenant compliance under the indenture governing our Senior Notes and/or secured credit facilities. Adjusted EBITDA Margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenues.\nKey Income Statement Line Item Descriptions\nRevenues. Our primary source of revenues is sales at our Company-operated venues ( company venue sales\u201d), which consist of the sale of food, beverages, game-play credits, unlimited game-play time blocks, and merchandise. A portion of our company venue sales are from sales of value-priced combination packages generally comprised of food and beverage only ( Package Deals\u201d), with game plays and/or time blocks available for purchase separately. We promote these offerings through in-venue menu pricing, our website and coupon offerings. Through the second quarter of 2018, we offered value-priced combination packages generally comprised of food, beverage, game plays and/or time blocks. We allocated the revenues recognized from the sale of these combination packages and coupons between Food and beverage sales\u201d and Entertainment and merchandise sales\u201d based upon the price charged for each component when it was sold separately, or in limited circumstances, our best estimate of selling price if a component was not sold on a stand-alone basis, which we believe approximates each component's fair value.\nFood and beverage sales include all revenues recognized with respect to stand-alone food and beverage sales, and through the end of the second quarter of 2018, the portion of revenues allocated from combination packages and coupons that relate to food and beverage sales. Entertainment and merchandise sales include all revenues recognized with respect to stand-alone sales of game-play credits and unlimited game-play time blocks, and through the end of the second quarter of 2018, a portion of revenues allocated from combination packages and coupons that relate to entertainment and merchandise.\nFranchise fees and royalties are another source of revenues. We earn monthly royalties from our franchisees based on a percentage of each franchise venue's sales. We also receive development and initial franchise fees to establish new franchised venues, as well as earn revenues from the sale of equipment and other items or services to franchisees. Effective January 1, 2018, with the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-10 Revenues from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ( ASU 606\u201d), we recognize initial and renewal development and franchise fees as revenues on a straight-line basis over the life of the franchise agreement starting when the franchise venue has opened. Prior to the adoption of ASU 6060, we recognized development and franchise fees as revenues when the franchise venue had opened and we had substantially completed our obligations to the franchisee relating to the opening of a venue. In addition, our national advertising fund receipts from members of the Association are now accounted for on a gross basis as revenue from franchisees, when prior to the adoption of ASU 606 they had been netted against advertising expense.\nCompany venue operating costs. Certain of our costs and expenses relate only to the operation of our Company-operated venues. These costs and expenses are listed and described below:\n \u2022 Cost of food and beverage includes all direct costs of food, beverages and costs of related paper and birthday supplies, less rebates from suppliers; \n \u2022 Cost of entertainment and merchandise includes all direct costs of tickets issued, stored-value Play Pass and AYCP cards, prizes provided and merchandise sold to our customers; \n \u2022 Labor expenses consist of salaries and wages, bonuses, related payroll taxes and benefits for venue personnel; \n \u2022 Lease costs include lease costs for Company-operated venues and, effective the first day of Fiscal 2019, in connection with the adoption of a new lease accounting standard, lease costs include common area maintenance ( CAM\u201d) charges; and \n \u2022 Other venue operating expenses primarily include utilities, repair and maintenance costs, liability and property insurance, property taxes, credit card processing fees, licenses, preopening expenses, venue asset disposal gains and losses, CAM charges (through the end of Fiscal 2018 as discussed under Lease costs above), and all other costs directly related to the operation of a venue.  Cost of food and beverage\u201d and Cost of entertainment and merchandise\u201d, as a percentage of company venue sales, are influenced both by the cost of products and the overall mix of our Package Deals and coupon offerings. Entertainment and merchandise sales\u201d have higher margins than Food and beverage sales.\u201d\nAdvertising expense. Advertising expense includes production costs for television commercials, newspaper inserts, Internet advertising, coupons, media expenses for national and local advertising, consulting fees and other forms of advertising such as social media. Historically, prior to the adoption of ASU 606 on January 1, 2018, advertising expense was partially offset by contributions from our franchisees. Contributions from franchisees are now recognized as revenue from franchisees.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses represent all costs associated with operating our corporate office, including regional and district management and corporate personnel payroll and benefits, back-office support systems, costs of outsourced functions, and other administrative costs not directly related to the operation of our Company-operated venues.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization includes expenses that are (i) directly related to our Company-operated venues' property and equipment, including leasehold improvements, game and ride equipment, furniture, fixtures and other equipment, and (ii) depreciation and amortization of corporate assets and intangibles.\nAsset impairments. Asset impairments represent non-cash charges to reduce the carrying amount of certain long-lived assets within our venues to their estimated fair value, when a venue's operation is not expected to generate sufficient projected future cash flows to recover the current net book value of the long-lived assets within the venue. We believe our assumptions in calculating the fair value of our long-lived assets are similar to those used by other marketplace participants.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes

Common area maintenance charges were previously included in Other venue operating costs. \n (5) Due to rounding, percentages presented in the table above may not sum to total. The percentage amounts for the components of Cost of food and beverage and the Cost of entertainment and merchandise may not sum to total due to the fact that Cost of food and beverage and Cost of entertainment and merchandise are expressed as a percentage of related Food and beverage sales and Entertainment and merchandise sales, as opposed to Total Company venue sales. \nFiscal 2019 Compared to Fiscal 2018\nRevenues\nCompany venue sales were $890.1 million and $875.3 million for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively. The increase in Company venue sales was primarily attributable to a 2.7% increase in comparable venue sales, partially offset by a $2.6 million decrease in Company venue sales from our non-comparable venues primarily due to a net reduction of seven Company-operated venues over the last two years. In addition, net revenue deferrals related to Play Pass and unredeemed tickets were $0.1 million for 2019 compared to $6.6 million in net revenue breakage for 2018, which further offset the increase in comparable venue sales.\nFranchise fees and royalties increased from $20.7 million to $22.8 million primarily due to a net increase in average franchise locations during Fiscal 2019.\nCompany Venue Operating Costs\nThe cost of food, beverage, entertainment and merchandise, as a percentage of Total company venue sales, was 14.8% and 15.0% for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively.\nThe cost of food and beverage as a percentage of food and beverage sales, was 23.2% and 23.8% for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively. The decrease in the cost of food and beverage on a percentage basis in 2019 was driven by an increase in average selling prices and favorability in commodities volume, primarily related to cheese, pizza dough and chicken wings compared to 2018.\nThe cost of entertainment and merchandise, as a percentage of Entertainment and merchandise sales, was 8.2% and 7.7% for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively. The cost of entertainment and merchandise, as a percentage of Entertainment and merchandise in 2019 compared to 2018 reflects a combination of the impact of AYCP and More Tickets, which were launched nationally during the third quarter of 2018.\nGross profit, which represents Total revenues less Total cost of food, beverage, entertainment and merchandise, as a percentage of Total revenues, was 85.6% and 85.4% for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively.\nLabor expenses, as a percentage of Total company venue sales, were 29.6% and 29.3% for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively, as wage pressures exceeded the favorable impact of a decrease in labor hours on higher sales. Our sales per labor hour improved approximately 4.8% in 2019 from 2018.\nLease costs, as a percentage of sales, were 12.3% and 11.0%, for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively. Lease costs for Fiscal 2019 were impacted by the adoption of a new lease standard effective December 31, 2018, the first day of Fiscal 2019, that requires us to recognize lease and non-lease components, such as CAM charges, as lease costs, rather than reflecting CAM charges as Other venue operating expenses. Excluding CAM charges, Lease costs, as a percentage of sales, would have been 10.7% for Fiscal 2019, reflecting an increase in Company venue sales.\nOther venue operating expenses, as a percentage of Total company venue sales, were 15.1% and 17.2% for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively. Other venue operating expenses for 2019 were impacted by the adoption of a new lease standard, as discussed in the previous paragraph under Lease costs. Other venue operating expenses as a percentage of sales, including the impact of CAM charges, would have been 16.7% for 2019, reflecting savings initiatives and efficiencies in general operating costs. In addition, Other venue operating expenses for Fiscal 2018 included expenses related to the production and deployment of new menu boards and panels in connection with the launch of AYCP. These favorable impacts were partially offset by an increase in bank and credit card service fees, as the percentage of credit card sales increased in 2019 from 2018.\nAdvertising Expense\nAdvertising expense was $44.7 million and $48.2 million for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively, due to a shift in our marketing strategy away from television and print advertising to targeted digital and social media platforms.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $57.0 million and $54.9 million for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively. The increase in General and administrative expenses in 2019 is primarily due to an increase in performance-based compensation as a result of improved operating results, and an increase in labor related litigation.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization was $97.6 million and $100.7 million for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively. The decrease in depreciation and amortization is primarily due to a decrease in the average number of Company-operated venues over the last two years as a result of venue closures and non-cash venue impairments recorded in 2019 and 2018.\nTransaction, Severance and Related Litigation Costs\nTransaction, severance and related litigation costs were $0.8 million and $0.5 million for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively. The Transaction, severance and related litigation costs for 2019 relate to $0.4 million in professional and legal fees incurred in connection with the refinancing of our senior secured facilities and $0.4 million in legal fees incurred primarily in connection with certain potential transactions which the Company did not pursue. See further discussion of the refinancing of our senior secured facilities in Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt Financing\u201d of this report. The Transaction, severance and related litigation costs for 2018 relate to $0.3 million in legal fees incurred in connection with Merger related litigation, and severance payments of $0.2 million.\nAsset Impairments\nIn Fiscal 2019, we recognized an asset impairment charge of $23.3 million primarily related to 16 venues, of which none were previously impaired. In Fiscal 2018 we recognized an asset impairment charge of $6.9 million primarily related to eight venues, of which one was previously impaired. We continue to operate all but two of the venues that were impaired in 2019 and all but three of the venues that were impaired in 2018. The impairment charges were based on the determination that the financial performance of these venues was adversely impacted by various competitive and economic factors in the markets in which the venues are located.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $87.2 million and $76.3 million for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively. The increase in interest expense is related to an increase in the weighted average effective rate incurred on our borrowings under both our 2019 and 2014 Secured Credit Facilities, driven by the higher interest margin on our recently refinanced secured credit facilities and increases in LIBOR rates. The weighted average effective interest rate incurred on our borrowings under our secured credit facilities and Senior Notes (including amortized debt issuance costs, amortization of original issue discount, commitment and other fees related to the Secured Credit Facilities and Senior Notes, but excluding the net loss on extinguishment of debt and $0.4 million of transaction costs expensed in Fiscal 2019 relating to the 2019 Secured Credit Facilities) was 7.5% and 6.4% for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively. See further discussion of the refinancing of our senior secured facilities in Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt Financing\u201d of this report.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nIn Fiscal 2019 we recognized a Loss on Extinguishment of Debt of $2.2 million. The Loss on Extinguishment of Debt reflects a $2.9 million loss in connection with the refinancing of our 2014 Secured Credit Facilities, partially offset by a $0.7 million gain on the repurchase of $39.3 million of our outstanding Senior Notes in the open market. See further discussion of the refinancing of our senior secured facilities and the repurchase of Senior Notes in Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt Financing\u201d of this report.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective income tax rates for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018 were 26.4% and 16.9%, respectively (where the effective income tax rate for Fiscal 2018 excludes adjustments recorded in that year in relation to the provisional estimate made in Fiscal 2017 to account for the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the TCJA\u201d) pursuant to Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d) issued by the SEC staff on December 22, 2017).\nOur effective income tax rate for Fiscal 2019 was favorably impacted by employment-related federal income tax credits, offset by the following:\n (i) nondeductible penalties and other expenses; \n (ii) state income taxes; \n (iii) foreign income taxes withheld (not offset by foreign tax credits due to the foreign tax credit limitation); \n (iv) accruals for uncertain tax positions; and \n (v) an increase in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets associated with a carryforward of state tax credits that are more than likely to expire before utilized. \nOur effective income tax rate for Fiscal 2018 was favorably impacted by employment-related federal income tax credits, offset by the following:\n (i) nondeductible litigation costs related to the Merger; \n (ii) nondeductible penalties and other expenses; \n (iii) state income taxes including an increase in our state income tax expense caused by state tax legislation enacted during the second quarter that increased the amount of income subject to state taxation; \n (iv) foreign income taxes withheld (not offset by a foreign tax credits due to the foreign tax credit limitation); \n (v) accruals for uncertain tax positions; \n (vi) an increase in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets associated with a carryforward of state tax credits that are more than likely to expire before utilized; and \n (vii) an increase in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets relating to our Canada operations that could expire before they are utilized, partially offset by a favorable one-time adjustment to deferred tax (the tax effect of the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment existing as of January 1, 2018) resulting from the change in our intent to no longer indefinitely reinvest monies previously loaned to our Canadian subsidiary recorded in the first quarter of Fiscal 2018. \nOur total effective income tax rate for Fiscal 2018 was 19.7% and includes 2.8% of favorable adjustments to the provisional estimate provided in Fiscal 2017 to account for the impact of the TCJA pursuant to SAB 118. Pursuant to SAB 118, we included a provisional estimate of $66.6 million tax benefit in our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, relating to the enactment of TJCA, which primarily related to the re-measurement of our deferred tax liability. In the second quarter of Fiscal 2018, we recorded an adjustment to the provisional estimate of $0.2 million tax benefit, in the third quarter of Fiscal 2018, we recorded an incremental adjustment to the provisional estimate of $0.5 million tax benefit. The measurement period relating to the enactment of the TCJA ended during our fourth quarter, and the tax effects thereof were completed as of the end of Fiscal 2018.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview of Liquidity\nWe finance our business activities through cash flows provided by our operations.\nThe primary components of working capital are as follows:\n \u2022 our guests pay for their purchases in cash or credit cards at the time of the sale and the cash from these sales is typically received before our related accounts payable to suppliers and employee payroll becomes due; \n \u2022 frequent inventory turnover results in a limited investment required in inventories; and \n \u2022 our accounts payable cash management strategies.  As a result of these factors, our requirement for working capital is not significant and we are able to operate with a net working capital deficit (current liabilities in excess of current assets), similar to other companies in the restaurant industry. As part of our capital allocation strategy, we may elect from time to time to retire certain of our debt obligations through voluntary prepayments or open market purchases.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nThe following tables present summarized consolidated financial information that we believe is helpful in evaluating our liquidity and capital resources as of the periods presented:\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>111,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86,790\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>104,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(87,584\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(79,284\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(93,712\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(52,088\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,547\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,030\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>466\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(28,532\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,991\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash paid for interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77,315\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72,966\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64,675\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash paid (refunded) for income taxes, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7,264\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>151\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Available unused commitments under Revolving Credit Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>105,538\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>141,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and available unused commitments under the revolving credit facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>140,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>204,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term loan facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>760,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>723,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>215,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>255,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFunds generated by our operating activities and available cash and cash equivalents continue to be our primary sources of liquidity. We believe these sources of liquidity will be sufficient to finance our strategic plan and capital initiatives for the next twelve months. However, in the event of a material decline in our sales trends or operating margins, there can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flows at or above our current levels. Our revolving credit facility is also available for additional working capital needs and investment opportunities. Our ability to access our revolving credit facility is subject to our compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit agreement governing such facility, including our compliance with certain prescribed covenants, as more fully described below.\nWe monitor the capital markets and our capital structure and make changes from time to time, with the goal of maintaining financial flexibility, preserving or improving liquidity and/or achieving cost efficiency. From time to time we may opportunistically pursue financing transactions or asset sales. In addition, we may elect to repurchase amounts of our outstanding debt, including the Senior Notes (as defined below under Debt Financing - Senior Unsecured Debt\u201d), for cash, through open market repurchases or privately negotiated transactions with certain of our debt holders, although there is no assurance we will do so.\nAs of December 29, 2019, we had no borrowings outstanding and an $8.5 million of letter of credit issued but undrawn under our revolving credit facility, leaving $105.5 million in borrowing capacity under the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below under Debt Financing - Secured Credit Facilities) as of December 29, 2019. As of December 30, 2018, we had no borrowings outstanding and a $9.0 million of letter of credit issued but undrawn under our revolving credit facility leaving $141.0 million in borrowing capacity under the 2014 Senior Secured Facilities (as defined below under Debt Financing - Secured Credit Facilities\u201d).\nOur primary uses for cash provided by operating activities relate to funding our ongoing business activities, planned capital expenditures, servicing our debt, and the payment of income taxes.\nOur strategic plan does not require that we enter into any material development or contractual purchase obligations. Therefore, we have the flexibility necessary to manage our liquidity by promptly deferring or curtailing any planned capital spending.\nSources and Uses of Cash - Fiscal 2019 Compared to Fiscal 2018\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $111.1 million and $86.8 million in Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to improved results from operations, income tax refunds received and favorable fluctuations in our working capital.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $87.6 million and $79.3 million in Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities in Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018 relates primarily to capital expenditures.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $52.1 million and $11.5 million in Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively. The net cash used in financing activities for Fiscal 2019 includes (i) 39.1 million in repurchases of our outstanding Senior Notes (including accrued interest), (ii) $6.0 million in loan costs and third party legal and other professional fees paid, net of proceeds received, in connection with the refinancing of our secured credit facilities in the third quarter of 2019, (iii) principal payments on our 2014 Secured Credit Facilities, and (iv) other lease related obligations. See Debt Financing - Secured Credit Facilities below for further discussion of the refinancing of our secured credit facilities. Net cash used in financing activities in Fiscal 2018 related primarily to (i) principal payments on our 2014 Secured Credit Facilities, and (ii) other lease related obligations.\nSources and Uses of Cash - Fiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $86.8 million and $104.3 million in Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, respectively. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to an increase in our net loss, excluding the adjustment to our deferred taxes resulting from the enactment of the TCJA in Fiscal 2017, and fluctuations in working capital, partially offset by a reduction in income taxes receivable.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $79.3 million and $93.7 million in Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities in Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017 relates primarily to capital expenditures.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $11.5 million and $5.0 million in Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, respectively. The net cash used in financing activities for Fiscal 2018 related primarily to (i) principal payments on our term loan, and (ii) lease related obligations. Net cash used in financing activities for Fiscal 2017 related primarily to (i) principal payments on our term loan, and (ii) lease related obligations, partially offset by (iii) sale leaseback proceeds of $4.1 million and (iv) a $1.4 million return of capital.\nDebt Financing\nSecured Credit Facilities\nOn August 30, 2019 the Company entered into a new credit agreement and related security agreements with Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch, as administrative and collateral agent. The new credit agreement provides senior secured financing consisting of:\n (i) a $114 million secured revolving credit facility, which includes a $50 million letter of credit sub-facility (collectively the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility\u201d), with a maturity date of August 30, 2024 (the revolver maturity date); and \n (ii) a $760 million secured term loan facility (the 2019 Term Loan Facility\u201d and together with the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility, the 2019 Secured Credit Facilities\u201d) with a maturity date of August 30, 2026 (the term loan maturity date\u201d).  In the event more than $50 million of the Company's 8.0% Senior Notes maturing February 15, 2022 remain outstanding on November 16, 2021, the term loan maturity date will spring forward to such earlier date.\nThe net proceeds from the 2019 Secured Credit Facilities, plus cash on hand, were used to pay the outstanding principal, accrued interest and fees related to our secured credit facilities dated as of February 14, 2014, as amended by an incremental assumption agreement, dated as of May 8, 2018 (the 2014 Secured Credit Facilities\u201d), and debt issuance costs related to the 2019 Secured Credit Facilities. All obligations under the 2014 Secured Credit Facilities have been terminated.\nThe term loan under the 2019 Term Loan Facility was issued net of $30.4 million of original issue discount. We also incurred a total of $15.4 million in debt issuance costs ($13.4 million related to the issuance of the 2019 Term Loan Facility and $2.0 million related to the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility). The debt issuance costs are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as follows:\n \u2022 Loss on Extinguishment of Debt: We recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt totaling $2.9 million which includes $0.5 million of fees paid to lenders in connection with the 2019 Term Loan Facility and a write-off of $2.4 million of unamortized deferred financing costs and original issue discount related to the 2014 Secured \nCredit Facilities;\n \u2022 Transaction related costs: We expensed third party fees totaling $0.4 million related to legal fees incurred in connection with the 2019 Term Loan Facility; \n \u2022 Interest Expense: We expensed third party fees totaling $0.4 million related to rating agency fees incurred in connection with the 2019 Secured Credit Facilities; and \n \u2022 Deferred Financing Costs: Debt issuance costs totaling $14.1 million related to the 2019 Secured Credit Facilities were capitalized. We also continued to defer $2.1 million of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the 2014 Secured Credit Facilities.  The deferred financing costs related to the 2019 Term Loan Facility and original issue discount are amortized through the 2019 term loan maturity date, and the deferred financing costs related to the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility are being amortized through the 2019 revolver maturity date.\nAs of December 29, 2019, we had no borrowings outstanding and an $8.5 million letter of credit issued but undrawn under the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 30, 2018 we had a $9.0 million letter of credit issued but undrawn under the revolving credit facility related to the 2014 Senior Secured Facilities.\nBorrowings under the 2019 Secured Credit Facilities bear interest at a rate equal to, at the option of the Company, either:\n(a) a LIBOR rate determined by reference to the costs of funds for Eurodollar deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing, adjusted for certain additional costs, subject to a 1.00% floor; or\n(b) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the prime rate of Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch, and (iii) the one-month adjusted LIBOR plus 1.00%.\nIn each case the interest rate is also subject to an applicable margin determined as follows:\n\u20222019 Term Loan Facility:\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Margin for Base Rate Loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Margin for LIBOR Loans\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5.50%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.50%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\u20222019 Revolving Credit Facility:\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Total Leverage Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Revolver - Base Rate Loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Revolver - LIBOR Loans\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Greater than 4.80 to 1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.50%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.50%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less than or equal to 4.80 to 1.00 but greater than 4.30 to 1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.25%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.25%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less than or equal to 4.30 to 1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.00%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the period from August 30, 2019 through December 29, 2019 the applicable margin for LIBOR borrowings under the 2019 Secured Credit Facilities was 6.50%. During the period from December 30, 2018 through August 29, 2019 and for the 2018 fiscal year, the applicable margin for LIBOR borrowings under the 2014 Secured Credit Facilities was 3.25%.\nIn addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under both the 2019 and 2014 Secured Credit Facilities, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee to the lenders under the respective revolving credit facilities in respect of any unutilized commitments thereunder. The applicable commitment fee rate under the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility is determined as follows:\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Total Leverage Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Commitment Fee\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Greater than 4.30 to 1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.50%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less than or equal to 4.30 to 1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.375%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe commitment fee rate was 0.5% for 2019 and 2018 fiscal years.\nThe Company is also required to pay customary agency fees as well as letter of credit participation fees computed at a rate per annum equal to the applicable margin for revolving LIBOR based rate borrowings on the dollar equivalent of the daily stated amount of outstanding letters of credit, plus such letter of credit issuer's customary documentary and processing fees and charges, and a fronting fee computed at a rate equal to 0.125% per annum on the daily stated amount of each letter of credit.\nDuring the 2019 fiscal year, the federal funds rate ranged from 1.55% to 2.45%, the prime rate ranged from 4.75% to 5.50% and the one-month LIBOR ranged from 1.69% to 2.52%.\nThe weighted average effective interest rate incurred on our borrowings under both our 2019 and 2014 Secured Credit Facilities was 7.3% for the 2019 fiscal year. 5.8% for the 2018 fiscal year, and 4.7% for the 2017 fiscal year, which includes amortization of deferred financing costs related to our Secured Credit Facilities, amortization of our Term Loan Facility original issue discount and commitment and other fees related to our Secured Credit Facilities but excludes the Loss on extinguishment of debt and $0.4 million of transaction costs expensed in Fiscal 2019 relating to the 2019 Secured Credit Facilities.\nFor further information relating to the 2019 Secured Credit Facilities, including restrictive covenants, refer to Note 11, Indebtedness and Interest Expense - Secured Credit Facilities,\u201d to our our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of the Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSenior Unsecured Notes\nOur senior unsecured debt consists of $255.0 million aggregate principal amount borrowings of 8.0% Senior Notes due 2022 (the Senior Notes\u201d) of which as of December 29, 2019, $215.7 million was outstanding. During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2019, we repurchased in the open market, and retired, $39.3 million of the Senior Notes. We recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt totaling $0.7 million in Fiscal 2019 relating to the repurchases.\nThe weighted average effective interest rate incurred on borrowings under our Senior Notes was 8.2% for the 2019 fiscal year, and 8.2% for the 2018 and 2017 fiscal years, which includes amortization of debt issuance costs and other fees related to our Senior Notes but excludes the gain on extinguishment of debt.\nFor further information relating to the Senior Notes, including restrictive covenants, refer to Note 11, Indebtedness and Interest Expense - Senior Unsecured Notes,\u201d to our our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of the Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCapital Expenditures\nWe focus our capital expenditures on reinvestment into our existing Company-operated Chuck E. Cheese and PPP venues through various planned capital initiatives and the development or acquisition of additional Company-operated venues. During Fiscal 2019, we completed 281 game enhancements, 50 major remodels related to the re-imaging effort to update Chuck E. Cheese locations to a new look and feel, and we opened two new domestic Company-operated venues.\nWe have funded and expect to continue to fund our capital expenditures through existing cash flows from operations. Capital expenditures in 2019 totaled approximately $87.8 million.\nThe following table reconciles the approximate total capital spend by initiative to our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the periods presented:\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 29, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Growth capital spend (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,079\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance capital spend (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,656\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IT capital spend\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,919\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Capital Spend\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>87,788\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79,844\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>94,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________________\n (1) Growth capital spend includes major remodels, including the re-imaging effort to update Chuck E. Cheese venue to a new look and feel, venue expansions, new venue development, including relocations, our Play Pass initiative, and franchise acquisitions. \n (2) Maintenance capital spend includes game enhancements, general venue capital expenditures and corporate capital expenditures.  We currently estimate our capital expenditures in 2020 will total approximately $55 million to $65 million, inclusive of maintenance capital, growth capital and IT related capital.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations\nAs of December 29, 2019, we had no off-balance sheet financing arrangements as described in Regulation S-K Item 303(a)(4)(ii).\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 29, 2019: Table 131: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4-5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>849,638\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>93,748\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>181,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>170,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>404,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Secured credit facilities (2)\n</td> <td>760,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>722,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sale leaseback obligations\n</td> <td>242,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,588\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,797\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>168,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Notes\n</td> <td>215,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>215,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest obligations (3)\n</td> <td>454,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>149,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111,518\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase Obligations (4)\n</td> <td>38,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,937\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance leases\n</td> <td>21,474\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,328\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Uncertain tax positions (5)\n</td> <td>729\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>729\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,583,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>238,904\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>601,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>326,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,417,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________________\n (1) Includes the initial non-cancelable term plus renewal option periods provided for in the lease that can be reasonably assured but excludes contingent rent obligations and obligations to pay property taxes, insurance and maintenance on the leased assets. \n (2) Assumes repayment of the Senior Notes based on stated maturity date and that the maturity date does not spring forward to November 16, 2021 (see further discussion of the springing maturity under Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt Financing - Secured Credit Facilities\u201d). \n (3) Interest obligations represent an estimate of future interest payments under our secured credit facilities and Senior Notes. We calculated the estimate based on the terms of the secured credit facilities and Senior Notes. Our estimate assumes we will not have any amounts drawn on our revolving credit facility. \n (4) A purchase obligation\u201d is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on us and that specifies all significant terms, including (a) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; (b) fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and (c) the approximate timing of the transaction. Our purchase obligations primarily consist of obligations for the purchase of merchandise and entertainment inventory, obligations under fixed price purchase agreements and contracts with spot\u201d market prices primarily relating to food and beverage products, obligations for the purchase of commercial airtime, and obligations associated with the modernization of various information technology platforms. The above purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without significant penalty. \n (5) Due to the uncertainty related to the settlement of uncertain tax positions, only the current portion of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits (including accrued interest and penalties) has been provided in the table above. The non-current portion of $4.2 million is excluded from the table above.  As of December 29, 2019, unpaid obligations related to capital expenditures totaling $1.7 million were outstanding and included in accounts payable. These amounts are expected to be paid in less than one year.\nThe total estimate of accrued liabilities for our self-insurance programs was $12.9 million as of December 29, 2019. We estimate that $5.0 million of these liabilities will be paid in Fiscal 2020 and the remainder paid in Fiscal 2021 and beyond. Due to the nature of the underlying liabilities and the extended period of time often experienced in resolving insurance claims, we cannot make reliable estimates of the timing of cash payments to be made in the future for our obligations related to our insurance liabilities. Therefore, no amounts for such liabilities have been included in the table above.\nAs of December 29, 2019, we had $8.5 million of letters of credit issued but undrawn under the revolving credit facility. We utilize letters of credit primarily for our self-insurance programs. These letters of credit do not represent additional obligations of the Company since the underlying liabilities are already recorded in accrued liabilities. However, if we were unable to pay insurance claims when due, our insurance carrier could draw amounts owed under the letter of credit.\nIn addition, see further discussion of our indebtedness and future debt obligations above under Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt Financing.\u201d\nWe enter into various purchase agreements in the ordinary course of business and have fixed price agreements and contracts with spot\u201d market prices primarily relating to food and beverage products. Other than the purchase obligations included in the above table, we do not have any material contracts (either individually or in the aggregate) in place committing us to a minimum or fixed level of purchases or that are cancelable subject to significant penalty.\nInflation\nOur cost of operations, including but not limited to labor, food products, supplies, utilities, financing and rental costs, can be significantly affected by inflationary factors.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of our assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements, the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The use of estimates is pervasive throughout our consolidated financial statements and is affected by management judgment and uncertainties. Our estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience, current market trends and other factors that we believe to be relevant and reasonable at the time our consolidated financial statements were prepared. We continually evaluate the information used to make these estimates as our business and the economic environment change. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nThe significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are described in Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d We consider an accounting policy or estimate to be critical if it requires difficult, subjective or complex judgments and is material to the portrayal of our consolidated financial condition, changes in financial condition or results of operations. The selection, application and disclosure of the critical accounting policies and estimates have been reviewed by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Our accounting policies and estimates that our management considers most critical are as follows:\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nThe excess of the purchase price over fair value of net identifiable assets and liabilities of an acquired business ( goodwill\u201d), trademarks, trade names and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but rather tested quantitatively and qualitatively for impairment, at least annually, and whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Events or circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, significant changes in competition, a loss of key personnel, significant changes in our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business, significant negative industry or economic trends, or significant under-performance relative to expected historical or projected future results of operations. We determined that no triggering events occurred during Fiscal 2019.\nRecoverability of the carrying value of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level. In performing a quantitative analysis, we measure the recoverability of goodwill for our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved, which is classified as a Level 3 fair value measurement. The key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model include discount rates, growth rates, tax rates, cash flow projections and terminal value rates. Discount rates, growth rates and cash flow projections are the most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment.\nWe test indefinite-lived intangible assets utilizing the relief from royalty method to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinite-lived intangible asset, which is classified as a Level 3 fair value measurement. The relief from royalty method estimates our theoretical royalty savings from ownership of the intangible asset. Key assumptions used in this model include discount rates, royalty rates, growth rates, tax rates, sales projections and terminal value rates. Discount rates, royalty rates, growth rates and sales projections are the assumptions most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment. Discount rates used are similar to the rates estimated by the weighted average cost of capital considering any differences in company-specific risk factors.\nWe tested our goodwill, trademarks, trade names and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment as of October 1, 2019. The fair value of our goodwill, trademarks, trade names and other indefinite-lived intangible assets was in excess of the carrying value as of the date of our Fiscal 2019 goodwill impairment test. No indicators of impairment were identified from the date of our impairment test through the end of Fiscal 2019.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe review our property and equipment for indicators of impairment on an ongoing basis at the lowest level of cash flows available, which is on a venue-by-venue basis, to assess if the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Such events or\nchanges may include a significant change in the business climate in a particular market area (for example, due to economic downturn or natural disaster), historical negative cash flows or plans to dispose of or sell the property and equipment before the end of its previously estimated useful life. If an event or change in circumstances occurs, we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the property and equipment and its eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected future cash flows, undiscounted and without interest, is less than the asset carrying amount (an indication that the carrying amount may not be recoverable), we may be required to recognize an impairment loss. We estimate the fair value of a venue's property and equipment by discounting the expected future cash flows of the venue over its remaining lease term using a weighted average cost of capital commensurate with the risk.\nThe following estimates and assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis impact the fair value of a venue's long-lived assets:\n\u2022discount rate based on our weighted average cost of capital and the risk-free rate of return;\n\u2022sales growth rates and cash flow margins over the expected remaining lease terms;\n\u2022strategic plans, including projected capital spending and intent to exercise renewal options, for the venue;\n\u2022salvage values; and\n\u2022other risks and qualitative factors specific to the asset or conditions in the market in which the asset is\nlocated at the time the assessment was made.\nDuring Fiscal 2019, the average discount rate, average sales growth rate and average cash flow margin growth rate used were 8.8%, 0.0% and 0.0%, respectively. We believe our assumptions in calculating the fair value of our long-lived assets are similar to those used by other marketplace participants. If actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, we may be exposed to additional impairment charges, which could be material to our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nAccounting for Leases\nThe majority of our venues are leased. With the adoption of the new Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), effective December 31, 2018, we are required to recognize lease assets and lease obligations on the balance sheet. The determination of the lease obligations requires us to estimate the present value of our future lease commitments over their reasonably assured remaining lease term using a weighted average incremental borrowing rate commensurate with the rate of interest we would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to our future lease payments in a similar economic environment. We utilized the transition method included in Leases (Topic 842): Target improvements which allowed us to apply ASU 2016-02 at the adoption date. Therefore, the presentation of financial information for periods prior to December 31, 2018 remained unchanged.\nThe terms of our venue leases vary in length from lease to lease, although a typical lease provides for an initial primary term of 10 years with two additional five year options to renew. We estimate the expected term of a lease by assuming the exercise of renewal options, in addition to the initial non-cancelable lease term, if the renewal is reasonably assured. Generally, reasonably assured\u201d relates to our contractual right to renew and the existence of an economic penalty that would preclude the abandonment of the lease at the end of the initial non-cancelable lease term. The expected term is used in the determination of our lease obligations. Additionally, the useful life of leasehold improvements is limited by the expected lease term or the economic life of the asset, whichever is shorter. If significant expenditures are made for leasehold improvements late in the expected term of a lease and renewal is reasonably assured, the useful life of the leasehold improvement is limited to the end of the reasonably assured renewal period or economic life of the asset.\nThe determination of the expected term of a lease requires us to apply judgment and estimates concerning the number of renewal periods that are reasonably assured. If a lease is terminated prior to reaching the end of the expected term, this may result in the acceleration of depreciation or impairment of a venue's long-lived assets and lease right-of-use asset.\nRecently Issued Accounting Guidance\nRefer to Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report for a description of recently issued accounting guidance.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nAs used in this report, the terms CEC Entertainment,\u201d CEC\u201d, the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us\u201d and our\u201d refer to CEC Entertainment, Inc. and its subsidiaries.\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to provide the readers of our Consolidated Financial Statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results. Our MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur MD&A includes the following sub-sections:\n \u2022 Presentation of Operating Results; \n \u2022 Executive Summary; \n \u2022 Key Measures of Our Financial Performance and Key Non-GAAP Measures; \n \u2022 Key Income Statement Line Item Descriptions; \n \u2022 Results of Operations; \n \u2022 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources; \n \u2022 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations; \n \u2022 Inflation; \n \u2022 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates; and \n \u2022 Recently Issued Accounting Guidance.  Presentation of Operating Results\nWe operate on a 52 or 53 week fiscal year that ends on the Sunday nearest to December 31. Each quarterly period has 13 weeks, except for a 53 week year, when the fourth quarter has 14 weeks. The fiscal years ended December 29, 2019, December 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 each consisted of 52 weeks. References to 2019, 2018 and 2017 are for the fiscal years ended December 29, 2019, December 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.\nExecutive Summary\nGeneral\nWe develop, operate and franchise family entertainment and dining centers (also referred to as venues\u201d) under the names Chuck E. Cheese\u201d ( Where A Kid Can Be A Kid\u201d) and Peter Piper Pizza\u201d ( Pizza Made Fresh, Families Made Happy\u201d). Our venues deliver a lively, kid-friendly atmosphere that feature a broad array of entertainment offerings including arcade-style and skill-oriented games, rides, live entertainment shows, and other attractions, with the opportunity for kids to win tickets that they can redeem for prizes. We combine this memorable entertainment experience with a broad and creative menu that combines kid-friendly classics as well as a new selection of sophisticated options for adults. We operate 555 venues and have an additional 186 venues operating under franchise arrangements, for a total of 741 system-wide venues across 47 states and 16 foreign countries and territories as of December 29, 2019.\nThe following table summarizes information regarding the number of system-wide Company-operated and franchised venues for the periods presented:\n\n__________________\n (1) The number of new and closed Company-operated and Total system-wide venues during 2018 includes one venue that was relocated.  Our Strategic Plan\nOur strategic objectives are focused on becoming the world's leading family friendly entertainment restaurant brands\u201d by entertaining and inspiring kids around the world and being the best place for everyday family fun, directed by premier brands and a commitment to ensuring that every guest is happy. This strategic plan is centered on the following six growth pillars: (i) increase traffic to our venues through marketing and sales promotions; (ii) drive in-store guest spending;(iii) pursue a programmatic approach to our domestic remodel program; (iv) expand the global franchise network; (v) launch a division to focus on entertainment & licensing efforts; and (vi) increase efficiencies and lower operating costs with tight controls. See discussion of our strategic plan included in Part I, Item 1. Business - Our Strategic Plan.\u201d\nKey Measures of Our Financial Performance and Key Non-GAAP Measures\nComparable venue sales. We define comparable venue sales\u201d as the sales for our domestic Company-operated venues that have been open for more than 18 months as of the beginning of each respective fiscal year or for acquired venues we have operated for at least 12 months as of the beginning of each respective fiscal year. Comparable venue sales excludes sales for our domestic Company-operated venues that are expected to be temporarily closed for more than three months primarily as a result of natural disasters, fires, floods and property damage. Company-operated venues that were temporarily closed for more than three months are included in comparable venue sales once the venues have been reopened for at least 12 months as of the beginning of each respective fiscal year. We define comparable venue sales change\u201d as the percentage change in comparable venue sales for each respective fiscal year. We believe comparable venue sales change to be a key performance indicator used within our industry; it is a critical factor when evaluating our performance, as it is indicative of acceptance of our strategic initiatives and local economic and consumer trends.\nAverage Sales per Comparable Venue. Average sales per comparable venue is calculated based on the average annual sales of our comparable venue base. Average sales per comparable venue cannot be used to compute year-over year comparable venue sales increases or decreases due to the change in the comparable venue base.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA and Margin. We define Adjusted EBITDA, a measure used by management to assess operating performance, as net income (loss) plus interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization expense, impairments, gains and losses on asset disposals, and stock based compensation. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA excludes other items we consider unusual or non-recurring and other adjustments required or permitted in calculating covenant compliance under the indenture governing our Senior Notes and/or secured credit facilities. Adjusted EBITDA Margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenues.\nKey Income Statement Line Item Descriptions\nRevenues. Our primary source of revenues is sales at our Company-operated venues ( company venue sales\u201d), which consist of the sale of food, beverages, game-play credits, unlimited game-play time blocks, and merchandise. A portion of our company venue sales are from sales of value-priced combination packages generally comprised of food and beverage only ( Package Deals\u201d), with game plays and/or time blocks available for purchase separately. We promote these offerings through in-venue menu pricing, our website and coupon offerings. Through the second quarter of 2018, we offered value-priced combination packages generally comprised of food, beverage, game plays and/or time blocks. We allocated the revenues recognized from the sale of these combination packages and coupons between Food and beverage sales\u201d and Entertainment and merchandise sales\u201d based upon the price charged for each component when it was sold separately, or in limited circumstances, our best estimate of selling price if a component was not sold on a stand-alone basis, which we believe approximates each component's fair value.\nFood and beverage sales include all revenues recognized with respect to stand-alone food and beverage sales, and through the end of the second quarter of 2018, the portion of revenues allocated from combination packages and coupons that relate to food and beverage sales. Entertainment and merchandise sales include all revenues recognized with respect to stand-alone sales of game-play credits and unlimited game-play time blocks, and through the end of the second quarter of 2018, a portion of revenues allocated from combination packages and coupons that relate to entertainment and merchandise.\nFranchise fees and royalties are another source of revenues. We earn monthly royalties from our franchisees based on a percentage of each franchise venue's sales. We also receive development and initial franchise fees to establish new franchised venues, as well as earn revenues from the sale of equipment and other items or services to franchisees. Effective January 1, 2018, with the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-10 Revenues from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ( ASU 606\u201d), we recognize initial and renewal development and franchise fees as revenues on a straight-line basis over the life of the franchise agreement starting when the franchise venue has opened. Prior to the adoption of ASU 6060, we recognized development and franchise fees as revenues when the franchise venue had opened and we had substantially completed our obligations to the franchisee relating to the opening of a venue. In addition, our national advertising fund receipts from members of the Association are now accounted for on a gross basis as revenue from franchisees, when prior to the adoption of ASU 606 they had been netted against advertising expense.\nCompany venue operating costs. Certain of our costs and expenses relate only to the operation of our Company-operated venues. These costs and expenses are listed and described below:\n \u2022 Cost of food and beverage includes all direct costs of food, beverages and costs of related paper and birthday supplies, less rebates from suppliers; \n \u2022 Cost of entertainment and merchandise includes all direct costs of tickets issued, stored-value Play Pass and AYCP cards, prizes provided and merchandise sold to our customers; \n \u2022 Labor expenses consist of salaries and wages, bonuses, related payroll taxes and benefits for venue personnel; \n \u2022 Lease costs include lease costs for Company-operated venues and, effective the first day of Fiscal 2019, in connection with the adoption of a new lease accounting standard, lease costs include common area maintenance ( CAM\u201d) charges; and \n \u2022 Other venue operating expenses primarily include utilities, repair and maintenance costs, liability and property insurance, property taxes, credit card processing fees, licenses, preopening expenses, venue asset disposal gains and losses, CAM charges (through the end of Fiscal 2018 as discussed under Lease costs above), and all other costs directly related to the operation of a venue.  Cost of food and beverage\u201d and Cost of entertainment and merchandise\u201d, as a percentage of company venue sales, are influenced both by the cost of products and the overall mix of our Package Deals and coupon offerings. Entertainment and merchandise sales\u201d have higher margins than Food and beverage sales.\u201d\nAdvertising expense. Advertising expense includes production costs for television commercials, newspaper inserts, Internet advertising, coupons, media expenses for national and local advertising, consulting fees and other forms of advertising such as social media. Historically, prior to the adoption of ASU 606 on January 1, 2018, advertising expense was partially offset by contributions from our franchisees. Contributions from franchisees are now recognized as revenue from franchisees.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses represent all costs associated with operating our corporate office, including regional and district management and corporate personnel payroll and benefits, back-office support systems, costs of outsourced functions, and other administrative costs not directly related to the operation of our Company-operated venues.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization includes expenses that are (i) directly related to our Company-operated venues' property and equipment, including leasehold improvements, game and ride equipment, furniture, fixtures and other equipment, and (ii) depreciation and amortization of corporate assets and intangibles.\nAsset impairments. Asset impairments represent non-cash charges to reduce the carrying amount of certain long-lived assets within our venues to their estimated fair value, when a venue's operation is not expected to generate sufficient projected future cash flows to recover the current net book value of the long-lived assets within the venue. We believe our assumptions in calculating the fair value of our long-lived assets are similar to those used by other marketplace participants.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our principal sources of company venue sales expressed in dollars and as a percentage of Total company venue sales for the periods presented:\n\nThe following table summarizes our revenues and expenses expressed in dollars and as a percentage of Total revenues (except as otherwise noted) for the periods presented:\n\n__________________\n (1) Percent amount expressed as a percentage of Food and beverage sales. \n (2) Percent amount expressed as a percentage of Entertainment and merchandise sales. \n (3) Percent amount expressed as a percentage of Company venue sales. \n (4) With the adoption of the new lease standard effective December 31, 2018, Lease costs for the twelve months ended December 29, 2019 include common area maintenance charges of $13.9 million. Common area maintenance charges were previously included in Other venue operating costs. \n (5) Due to rounding, percentages presented in the table above may not sum to total. The percentage amounts for the components of Cost of food and beverage and the Cost of entertainment and merchandise may not sum to total due to the fact that Cost of food and beverage and Cost of entertainment and merchandise are expressed as a percentage of related Food and beverage sales and Entertainment and merchandise sales, as opposed to Total Company venue sales. \nFiscal 2019 Compared to Fiscal 2018\nRevenues\nCompany venue sales were $890.1 million and $875.3 million for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively. The increase in Company venue sales was primarily attributable to a 2.7% increase in comparable venue sales, partially offset by a $2.6 million decrease in Company venue sales from our non-comparable venues primarily due to a net reduction of seven Company-operated venues over the last two years. In addition, net revenue deferrals related to Play Pass and unredeemed tickets were $0.1 million for 2019 compared to $6.6 million in net revenue breakage for 2018, which further offset the increase in comparable venue sales.\nFranchise fees and royalties increased from $20.7 million to $22.8 million primarily due to a net increase in average franchise locations during Fiscal 2019.\nCompany Venue Operating Costs\nThe cost of food, beverage, entertainment and merchandise, as a percentage of Total company venue sales, was 14.8% and 15.0% for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively.\nThe cost of food and beverage as a percentage of food and beverage sales, was 23.2% and 23.8% for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively. The decrease in the cost of food and beverage on a percentage basis in 2019 was driven by an increase in average selling prices and favorability in commodities volume, primarily related to cheese, pizza dough and chicken wings compared to 2018.\nThe cost of entertainment and merchandise, as a percentage of Entertainment and merchandise sales, was 8.2% and 7.7% for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively. The cost of entertainment and merchandise, as a percentage of Entertainment and merchandise in 2019 compared to 2018 reflects a combination of the impact of AYCP and More Tickets, which were launched nationally during the third quarter of 2018.\nGross profit, which represents Total revenues less Total cost of food, beverage, entertainment and merchandise, as a percentage of Total revenues, was 85.6% and 85.4% for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively.\nLabor expenses, as a percentage of Total company venue sales, were 29.6% and 29.3% for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively, as wage pressures exceeded the favorable impact of a decrease in labor hours on higher sales. Our sales per labor hour improved approximately 4.8% in 2019 from 2018.\nLease costs, as a percentage of sales, were 12.3% and 11.0%, for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively. Lease costs for Fiscal 2019 were impacted by the adoption of a new lease standard effective December 31, 2018, the first day of Fiscal 2019, that requires us to recognize lease and non-lease components, such as CAM charges, as lease costs, rather than reflecting CAM charges as Other venue operating expenses. Excluding CAM charges, Lease costs, as a percentage of sales, would have been 10.7% for Fiscal 2019, reflecting an increase in Company venue sales.\nOther venue operating expenses, as a percentage of Total company venue sales, were 15.1% and 17.2% for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively. Other venue operating expenses for 2019 were impacted by the adoption of a new lease standard, as discussed in the previous paragraph under Lease costs. Other venue operating expenses as a percentage of sales, including the impact of CAM charges, would have been 16.7% for 2019, reflecting savings initiatives and efficiencies in general operating costs. In addition, Other venue operating expenses for Fiscal 2018 included expenses related to the production and deployment of new menu boards and panels in connection with the launch of AYCP. These favorable impacts were partially offset by an increase in bank and credit card service fees, as the percentage of credit card sales increased in 2019 from 2018.\nAdvertising Expense\nAdvertising expense was $44.7 million and $48.2 million for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively, due to a shift in our marketing strategy away from television and print advertising to targeted digital and social media platforms.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $57.0 million and $54.9 million for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively. The increase in General and administrative expenses in 2019 is primarily due to an increase in performance-based compensation as a result of improved operating results, and an increase in labor related litigation.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization was $97.6 million and $100.7 million for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively. The decrease in depreciation and amortization is primarily due to a decrease in the average number of Company-operated venues over the last two years as a result of venue closures and non-cash venue impairments recorded in 2019 and 2018.\nTransaction, Severance and Related Litigation Costs\nTransaction, severance and related litigation costs were $0.8 million and $0.5 million for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively. The Transaction, severance and related litigation costs for 2019 relate to $0.4 million in professional and legal fees incurred in connection with the refinancing of our senior secured facilities and $0.4 million in legal fees incurred primarily in connection with certain potential transactions which the Company did not pursue. See further discussion of the refinancing of our senior secured facilities in Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt Financing\u201d of this report. The Transaction, severance and related litigation costs for 2018 relate to $0.3 million in legal fees incurred in connection with Merger related litigation, and severance payments of $0.2 million.\nAsset Impairments\nIn Fiscal 2019, we recognized an asset impairment charge of $23.3 million primarily related to 16 venues, of which none were previously impaired. In Fiscal 2018 we recognized an asset impairment charge of $6.9 million primarily related to eight venues, of which one was previously impaired. We continue to operate all but two of the venues that were impaired in 2019 and all but three of the venues that were impaired in 2018. The impairment charges were based on the determination that the financial performance of these venues was adversely impacted by various competitive and economic factors in the markets in which the venues are located.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $87.2 million and $76.3 million for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively. The increase in interest expense is related to an increase in the weighted average effective rate incurred on our borrowings under both our 2019 and 2014 Secured Credit Facilities, driven by the higher interest margin on our recently refinanced secured credit facilities and increases in LIBOR rates. The weighted average effective interest rate incurred on our borrowings under our secured credit facilities and Senior Notes (including amortized debt issuance costs, amortization of original issue discount, commitment and other fees related to the Secured Credit Facilities and Senior Notes, but excluding the net loss on extinguishment of debt and $0.4 million of transaction costs expensed in Fiscal 2019 relating to the 2019 Secured Credit Facilities) was 7.5% and 6.4% for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively. See further discussion of the refinancing of our senior secured facilities in Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt Financing\u201d of this report.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nIn Fiscal 2019 we recognized a Loss on Extinguishment of Debt of $2.2 million. The Loss on Extinguishment of Debt reflects a $2.9 million loss in connection with the refinancing of our 2014 Secured Credit Facilities, partially offset by a $0.7 million gain on the repurchase of $39.3 million of our outstanding Senior Notes in the open market. See further discussion of the refinancing of our senior secured facilities and the repurchase of Senior Notes in Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt Financing\u201d of this report.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective income tax rates for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018 were 26.4% and 16.9%, respectively (where the effective income tax rate for Fiscal 2018 excludes adjustments recorded in that year in relation to the provisional estimate made in Fiscal 2017 to account for the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the TCJA\u201d) pursuant to Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d) issued by the SEC staff on December 22, 2017).\nOur effective income tax rate for Fiscal 2019 was favorably impacted by employment-related federal income tax credits, offset by the following:\n (i) nondeductible penalties and other expenses; \n (ii) state income taxes; \n (iii) foreign income taxes withheld (not offset by foreign tax credits due to the foreign tax credit limitation); \n (iv) accruals for uncertain tax positions; and \n (v) an increase in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets associated with a carryforward of state tax credits that are more than likely to expire before utilized. \nOur effective income tax rate for Fiscal 2018 was favorably impacted by employment-related federal income tax credits, offset by the following:\n (i) nondeductible litigation costs related to the Merger; \n (ii) nondeductible penalties and other expenses; \n (iii) state income taxes including an increase in our state income tax expense caused by state tax legislation enacted during the second quarter that increased the amount of income subject to state taxation; \n (iv) foreign income taxes withheld (not offset by a foreign tax credits due to the foreign tax credit limitation); \n (v) accruals for uncertain tax positions; \n (vi) an increase in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets associated with a carryforward of state tax credits that are more than likely to expire before utilized; and \n (vii) an increase in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets relating to our Canada operations that could expire before they are utilized, partially offset by a favorable one-time adjustment to deferred tax (the tax effect of the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment existing as of January 1, 2018) resulting from the change in our intent to no longer indefinitely reinvest monies previously loaned to our Canadian subsidiary recorded in the first quarter of Fiscal 2018. \nOur total effective income tax rate for Fiscal 2018 was 19.7% and includes 2.8% of favorable adjustments to the provisional estimate provided in Fiscal 2017 to account for the impact of the TCJA pursuant to SAB 118. Pursuant to SAB 118, we included a provisional estimate of $66.6 million tax benefit in our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, relating to the enactment of TJCA, which primarily related to the re-measurement of our deferred tax liability. In the second quarter of Fiscal 2018, we recorded an adjustment to the provisional estimate of $0.2 million tax benefit, in the third quarter of Fiscal 2018, we recorded an incremental adjustment to the provisional estimate of $0.5 million tax benefit. The measurement period relating to the enactment of the TCJA ended during our fourth quarter, and the tax effects thereof were completed as of the end of Fiscal 2018.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview of Liquidity\nWe finance our business activities through cash flows provided by our operations.\nThe primary components of working capital are as follows:\n \u2022 our guests pay for their purchases in cash or credit cards at the time of the sale and the cash from these sales is typically received before our related accounts payable to suppliers and employee payroll becomes due; \n \u2022 frequent inventory turnover results in a limited investment required in inventories; and \n \u2022 our accounts payable cash management strategies.  As a result of these factors, our requirement for working capital is not significant and we are able to operate with a net working capital deficit (current liabilities in excess of current assets), similar to other companies in the restaurant industry. As part of our capital allocation strategy, we may elect from time to time to retire certain of our debt obligations through voluntary prepayments or open market purchases.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nThe following tables present summarized consolidated financial information that we believe is helpful in evaluating our liquidity and capital resources as of the periods presented:\n\n\nFunds generated by our operating activities and available cash and cash equivalents continue to be our primary sources of liquidity. We believe these sources of liquidity will be sufficient to finance our strategic plan and capital initiatives for the next twelve months. However, in the event of a material decline in our sales trends or operating margins, there can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flows at or above our current levels. Our revolving credit facility is also available for additional working capital needs and investment opportunities. Our ability to access our revolving credit facility is subject to our compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit agreement governing such facility, including our compliance with certain prescribed covenants, as more fully described below.\nWe monitor the capital markets and our capital structure and make changes from time to time, with the goal of maintaining financial flexibility, preserving or improving liquidity and/or achieving cost efficiency. From time to time we may opportunistically pursue financing transactions or asset sales. In addition, we may elect to repurchase amounts of our outstanding debt, including the Senior Notes (as defined below under Debt Financing - Senior Unsecured Debt\u201d), for cash, through open market repurchases or privately negotiated transactions with certain of our debt holders, although there is no assurance we will do so.\nAs of December 29, 2019, we had no borrowings outstanding and an $8.5 million of letter of credit issued but undrawn under our revolving credit facility, leaving $105.5 million in borrowing capacity under the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below under Debt Financing - Secured Credit Facilities) as of December 29, 2019. As of December 30, 2018, we had no borrowings outstanding and a $9.0 million of letter of credit issued but undrawn under our revolving credit facility leaving $141.0 million in borrowing capacity under the 2014 Senior Secured Facilities (as defined below under Debt Financing - Secured Credit Facilities\u201d).\nOur primary uses for cash provided by operating activities relate to funding our ongoing business activities, planned capital expenditures, servicing our debt, and the payment of income taxes.\nOur strategic plan does not require that we enter into any material development or contractual purchase obligations. Therefore, we have the flexibility necessary to manage our liquidity by promptly deferring or curtailing any planned capital spending.\nSources and Uses of Cash - Fiscal 2019 Compared to Fiscal 2018\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $111.1 million and $86.8 million in Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to improved results from operations, income tax refunds received and favorable fluctuations in our working capital.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $87.6 million and $79.3 million in Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities in Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018 relates primarily to capital expenditures.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $52.1 million and $11.5 million in Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively. The net cash used in financing activities for Fiscal 2019 includes (i) 39.1 million in repurchases of our outstanding Senior Notes (including accrued interest), (ii) $6.0 million in loan costs and third party legal and other professional fees paid, net of proceeds received, in connection with the refinancing of our secured credit facilities in the third quarter of 2019, (iii) principal payments on our 2014 Secured Credit Facilities, and (iv) other lease related obligations. See Debt Financing - Secured Credit Facilities below for further discussion of the refinancing of our secured credit facilities. Net cash used in financing activities in Fiscal 2018 related primarily to (i) principal payments on our 2014 Secured Credit Facilities, and (ii) other lease related obligations.\nSources and Uses of Cash - Fiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $86.8 million and $104.3 million in Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, respectively. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to an increase in our net loss, excluding the adjustment to our deferred taxes resulting from the enactment of the TCJA in Fiscal 2017, and fluctuations in working capital, partially offset by a reduction in income taxes receivable.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $79.3 million and $93.7 million in Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities in Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017 relates primarily to capital expenditures.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $11.5 million and $5.0 million in Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, respectively. The net cash used in financing activities for Fiscal 2018 related primarily to (i) principal payments on our term loan, and (ii) lease related obligations. Net cash used in financing activities for Fiscal 2017 related primarily to (i) principal payments on our term loan, and (ii) lease related obligations, partially offset by (iii) sale leaseback proceeds of $4.1 million and (iv) a $1.4 million return of capital.\nDebt Financing\nSecured Credit Facilities\nOn August 30, 2019 the Company entered into a new credit agreement and related security agreements with Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch, as administrative and collateral agent. The new credit agreement provides senior secured financing consisting of:\n (i) a $114 million secured revolving credit facility, which includes a $50 million letter of credit sub-facility (collectively the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility\u201d), with a maturity date of August 30, 2024 (the revolver maturity date); and \n (ii) a $760 million secured term loan facility (the 2019 Term Loan Facility\u201d and together with the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility, the 2019 Secured Credit Facilities\u201d) with a maturity date of August 30, 2026 (the term loan maturity date\u201d).  In the event more than $50 million of the Company's 8.0% Senior Notes maturing February 15, 2022 remain outstanding on November 16, 2021, the term loan maturity date will spring forward to such earlier date.\nThe net proceeds from the 2019 Secured Credit Facilities, plus cash on hand, were used to pay the outstanding principal, accrued interest and fees related to our secured credit facilities dated as of February 14, 2014, as amended by an incremental assumption agreement, dated as of May 8, 2018 (the 2014 Secured Credit Facilities\u201d), and debt issuance costs related to the 2019 Secured Credit Facilities. All obligations under the 2014 Secured Credit Facilities have been terminated.\nThe term loan under the 2019 Term Loan Facility was issued net of $30.4 million of original issue discount. We also incurred a total of $15.4 million in debt issuance costs ($13.4 million related to the issuance of the 2019 Term Loan Facility and $2.0 million related to the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility). The debt issuance costs are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as follows:\n \u2022 Loss on Extinguishment of Debt: We recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt totaling $2.9 million which includes $0.5 million of fees paid to lenders in connection with the 2019 Term Loan Facility and a write-off of $2.4 million of unamortized deferred financing costs and original issue discount related to the 2014 Secured \nCredit Facilities;\n \u2022 Transaction related costs: We expensed third party fees totaling $0.4 million related to legal fees incurred in connection with the 2019 Term Loan Facility; \n \u2022 Interest Expense: We expensed third party fees totaling $0.4 million related to rating agency fees incurred in connection with the 2019 Secured Credit Facilities; and \n \u2022 Deferred Financing Costs: Debt issuance costs totaling $14.1 million related to the 2019 Secured Credit Facilities were capitalized. We also continued to defer $2.1 million of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the 2014 Secured Credit Facilities.  The deferred financing costs related to the 2019 Term Loan Facility and original issue discount are amortized through the 2019 term loan maturity date, and the deferred financing costs related to the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility are being amortized through the 2019 revolver maturity date.\nAs of December 29, 2019, we had no borrowings outstanding and an $8.5 million letter of credit issued but undrawn under the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 30, 2018 we had a $9.0 million letter of credit issued but undrawn under the revolving credit facility related to the 2014 Senior Secured Facilities.\nBorrowings under the 2019 Secured Credit Facilities bear interest at a rate equal to, at the option of the Company, either:\n(a) a LIBOR rate determined by reference to the costs of funds for Eurodollar deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing, adjusted for certain additional costs, subject to a 1.00% floor; or\n(b) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the prime rate of Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch, and (iii) the one-month adjusted LIBOR plus 1.00%.\nIn each case the interest rate is also subject to an applicable margin determined as follows:\n\u20222019 Term Loan Facility:\n\n\u20222019 Revolving Credit Facility:\n\nDuring the period from August 30, 2019 through December 29, 2019 the applicable margin for LIBOR borrowings under the 2019 Secured Credit Facilities was 6.50%. During the period from December 30, 2018 through August 29, 2019 and for the 2018 fiscal year, the applicable margin for LIBOR borrowings under the 2014 Secured Credit Facilities was 3.25%.\nIn addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under both the 2019 and 2014 Secured Credit Facilities, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee to the lenders under the respective revolving credit facilities in respect of any unutilized commitments thereunder. The applicable commitment fee rate under the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility is determined as follows:\n\nThe commitment fee rate was 0.5% for 2019 and 2018 fiscal years.\nThe Company is also required to pay customary agency fees as well as letter of credit participation fees computed at a rate per annum equal to the applicable margin for revolving LIBOR based rate borrowings on the dollar equivalent of the daily stated amount of outstanding letters of credit, plus such letter of credit issuer's customary documentary and processing fees and charges, and a fronting fee computed at a rate equal to 0.125% per annum on the daily stated amount of each letter of credit.\nDuring the 2019 fiscal year, the federal funds rate ranged from 1.55% to 2.45%, the prime rate ranged from 4.75% to 5.50% and the one-month LIBOR ranged from 1.69% to 2.52%.\nThe weighted average effective interest rate incurred on our borrowings under both our 2019 and 2014 Secured Credit Facilities was 7.3% for the 2019 fiscal year. 5.8% for the 2018 fiscal year, and 4.7% for the 2017 fiscal year, which includes amortization of deferred financing costs related to our Secured Credit Facilities, amortization of our Term Loan Facility original issue discount and commitment and other fees related to our Secured Credit Facilities but excludes the Loss on extinguishment of debt and $0.4 million of transaction costs expensed in Fiscal 2019 relating to the 2019 Secured Credit Facilities.\nFor further information relating to the 2019 Secured Credit Facilities, including restrictive covenants, refer to Note 11, Indebtedness and Interest Expense - Secured Credit Facilities,\u201d to our our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of the Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSenior Unsecured Notes\nOur senior unsecured debt consists of $255.0 million aggregate principal amount borrowings of 8.0% Senior Notes due 2022 (the Senior Notes\u201d) of which as of December 29, 2019, $215.7 million was outstanding. During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2019, we repurchased in the open market, and retired, $39.3 million of the Senior Notes. We recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt totaling $0.7 million in Fiscal 2019 relating to the repurchases.\nThe weighted average effective interest rate incurred on borrowings under our Senior Notes was 8.2% for the 2019 fiscal year, and 8.2% for the 2018 and 2017 fiscal years, which includes amortization of debt issuance costs and other fees related to our Senior Notes but excludes the gain on extinguishment of debt.\nFor further information relating to the Senior Notes, including restrictive covenants, refer to Note 11, Indebtedness and Interest Expense - Senior Unsecured Notes,\u201d to our our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of the Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCapital Expenditures\nWe focus our capital expenditures on reinvestment into our existing Company-operated Chuck E. Cheese and PPP venues through various planned capital initiatives and the development or acquisition of additional Company-operated venues. During Fiscal 2019, we completed 281 game enhancements, 50 major remodels related to the re-imaging effort to update Chuck E. Cheese locations to a new look and feel, and we opened two new domestic Company-operated venues.\nWe have funded and expect to continue to fund our capital expenditures through existing cash flows from operations. Capital expenditures in 2019 totaled approximately $87.8 million.\nThe following table reconciles the approximate total capital spend by initiative to our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the periods presented:\n\n__________________\n (1) Growth capital spend includes major remodels, including the re-imaging effort to update Chuck E. Cheese venue to a new look and feel, venue expansions, new venue development, including relocations, our Play Pass initiative, and franchise acquisitions. \n (2) Maintenance capital spend includes game enhancements, general venue capital expenditures and corporate capital expenditures.  We currently estimate our capital expenditures in 2020 will total approximately $55 million to $65 million, inclusive of maintenance capital, growth capital and IT related capital.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations\nAs of December 29, 2019, we had no off-balance sheet financing arrangements as described in Regulation S-K Item 303(a)(4)(ii).\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 29, 2019: \n__________________\n (1) Includes the initial non-cancelable term plus renewal option periods provided for in the lease that can be reasonably assured but excludes contingent rent obligations and obligations to pay property taxes, insurance and maintenance on the leased assets. \n (2) Assumes repayment of the Senior Notes based on stated maturity date and that the maturity date does not spring forward to November 16, 2021 (see further discussion of the springing maturity under Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt Financing - Secured Credit Facilities\u201d). \n (3) Interest obligations represent an estimate of future interest payments under our secured credit facilities and Senior Notes. We calculated the estimate based on the terms of the secured credit facilities and Senior Notes. Our estimate assumes we will not have any amounts drawn on our revolving credit facility. \n (4) A purchase obligation\u201d is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on us and that specifies all significant terms, including (a) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; (b) fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and (c) the approximate timing of the transaction. Our purchase obligations primarily consist of obligations for the purchase of merchandise and entertainment inventory, obligations under fixed price purchase agreements and contracts with spot\u201d market prices primarily relating to food and beverage products, obligations for the purchase of commercial airtime, and obligations associated with the modernization of various information technology platforms. The above purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without significant penalty. \n (5) Due to the uncertainty related to the settlement of uncertain tax positions, only the current portion of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits (including accrued interest and penalties) has been provided in the table above. The non-current portion of $4.2 million is excluded from the table above.  As of December 29, 2019, unpaid obligations related to capital expenditures totaling $1.7 million were outstanding and included in accounts payable. These amounts are expected to be paid in less than one year.\nThe total estimate of accrued liabilities for our self-insurance programs was $12.9 million as of December 29, 2019. We estimate that $5.0 million of these liabilities will be paid in Fiscal 2020 and the remainder paid in Fiscal 2021 and beyond. Due to the nature of the underlying liabilities and the extended period of time often experienced in resolving insurance claims, we cannot make reliable estimates of the timing of cash payments to be made in the future for our obligations related to our insurance liabilities. Therefore, no amounts for such liabilities have been included in the table above.\nAs of December 29, 2019, we had $8.5 million of letters of credit issued but undrawn under the revolving credit facility. We utilize letters of credit primarily for our self-insurance programs. These letters of credit do not represent additional obligations of the Company since the underlying liabilities are already recorded in accrued liabilities. However, if we were unable to pay insurance claims when due, our insurance carrier could draw amounts owed under the letter of credit.\nIn addition, see further discussion of our indebtedness and future debt obligations above under Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt Financing.\u201d\nWe enter into various purchase agreements in the ordinary course of business and have fixed price agreements and contracts with spot\u201d market prices primarily relating to food and beverage products. Other than the purchase obligations included in the above table, we do not have any material contracts (either individually or in the aggregate) in place committing us to a minimum or fixed level of purchases or that are cancelable subject to significant penalty.\nInflation\nOur cost of operations, including but not limited to labor, food products, supplies, utilities, financing and rental costs, can be significantly affected by inflationary factors.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of our assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements, the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The use of estimates is pervasive throughout our consolidated financial statements and is affected by management judgment and uncertainties. Our estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience, current market trends and other factors that we believe to be relevant and reasonable at the time our consolidated financial statements were prepared. We continually evaluate the information used to make these estimates as our business and the economic environment change. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nThe significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are described in Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d We consider an accounting policy or estimate to be critical if it requires difficult, subjective or complex judgments and is material to the portrayal of our consolidated financial condition, changes in financial condition or results of operations. The selection, application and disclosure of the critical accounting policies and estimates have been reviewed by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Our accounting policies and estimates that our management considers most critical are as follows:\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nThe excess of the purchase price over fair value of net identifiable assets and liabilities of an acquired business ( goodwill\u201d), trademarks, trade names and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but rather tested quantitatively and qualitatively for impairment, at least annually, and whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Events or circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, significant changes in competition, a loss of key personnel, significant changes in our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business, significant negative industry or economic trends, or significant under-performance relative to expected historical or projected future results of operations. We determined that no triggering events occurred during Fiscal 2019.\nRecoverability of the carrying value of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level. In performing a quantitative analysis, we measure the recoverability of goodwill for our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved, which is classified as a Level 3 fair value measurement. The key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model include discount rates, growth rates, tax rates, cash flow projections and terminal value rates. Discount rates, growth rates and cash flow projections are the most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment.\nWe test indefinite-lived intangible assets utilizing the relief from royalty method to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinite-lived intangible asset, which is classified as a Level 3 fair value measurement. The relief from royalty method estimates our theoretical royalty savings from ownership of the intangible asset. Key assumptions used in this model include discount rates, royalty rates, growth rates, tax rates, sales projections and terminal value rates. Discount rates, royalty rates, growth rates and sales projections are the assumptions most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment. Discount rates used are similar to the rates estimated by the weighted average cost of capital considering any differences in company-specific risk factors.\nWe tested our goodwill, trademarks, trade names and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment as of October 1, 2019. The fair value of our goodwill, trademarks, trade names and other indefinite-lived intangible assets was in excess of the carrying value as of the date of our Fiscal 2019 goodwill impairment test. No indicators of impairment were identified from the date of our impairment test through the end of Fiscal 2019.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe review our property and equipment for indicators of impairment on an ongoing basis at the lowest level of cash flows available, which is on a venue-by-venue basis, to assess if the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Such events or\nchanges may include a significant change in the business climate in a particular market area (for example, due to economic downturn or natural disaster), historical negative cash flows or plans to dispose of or sell the property and equipment before the end of its previously estimated useful life. If an event or change in circumstances occurs, we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the property and equipment and its eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected future cash flows, undiscounted and without interest, is less than the asset carrying amount (an indication that the carrying amount may not be recoverable), we may be required to recognize an impairment loss. We estimate the fair value of a venue's property and equipment by discounting the expected future cash flows of the venue over its remaining lease term using a weighted average cost of capital commensurate with the risk.\nThe following estimates and assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis impact the fair value of a venue's long-lived assets:\n\u2022discount rate based on our weighted average cost of capital and the risk-free rate of return;\n\u2022sales growth rates and cash flow margins over the expected remaining lease terms;\n\u2022strategic plans, including projected capital spending and intent to exercise renewal options, for the venue;\n\u2022salvage values; and\n\u2022other risks and qualitative factors specific to the asset or conditions in the market in which the asset is\nlocated at the time the assessment was made.\nDuring Fiscal 2019, the average discount rate, average sales growth rate and average cash flow margin growth rate used were 8.8%, 0.0% and 0.0%, respectively. We believe our assumptions in calculating the fair value of our long-lived assets are similar to those used by other marketplace participants. If actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, we may be exposed to additional impairment charges, which could be material to our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nAccounting for Leases\nThe majority of our venues are leased. With the adoption of the new Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), effective December 31, 2018, we are required to recognize lease assets and lease obligations on the balance sheet. The determination of the lease obligations requires us to estimate the present value of our future lease commitments over their reasonably assured remaining lease term using a weighted average incremental borrowing rate commensurate with the rate of interest we would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to our future lease payments in a similar economic environment. We utilized the transition method included in Leases (Topic 842): Target improvements which allowed us to apply ASU 2016-02 at the adoption date. Therefore, the presentation of financial information for periods prior to December 31, 2018 remained unchanged.\nThe terms of our venue leases vary in length from lease to lease, although a typical lease provides for an initial primary term of 10 years with two additional five year options to renew. We estimate the expected term of a lease by assuming the exercise of renewal options, in addition to the initial non-cancelable lease term, if the renewal is reasonably assured. Generally, reasonably assured\u201d relates to our contractual right to renew and the existence of an economic penalty that would preclude the abandonment of the lease at the end of the initial non-cancelable lease term. The expected term is used in the determination of our lease obligations. Additionally, the useful life of leasehold improvements is limited by the expected lease term or the economic life of the asset, whichever is shorter. If significant expenditures are made for leasehold improvements late in the expected term of a lease and renewal is reasonably assured, the useful life of the leasehold improvement is limited to the end of the reasonably assured renewal period or economic life of the asset.\nThe determination of the expected term of a lease requires us to apply judgment and estimates concerning the number of renewal periods that are reasonably assured. If a lease is terminated prior to reaching the end of the expected term, this may result in the acceleration of depreciation or impairment of a venue's long-lived assets and lease right-of-use asset.\nRecently Issued Accounting Guidance\nRefer to Note 1.
