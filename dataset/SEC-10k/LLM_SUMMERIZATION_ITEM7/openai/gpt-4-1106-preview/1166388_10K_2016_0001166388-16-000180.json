Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with \"Business\" under Item 1, \"Selected Financial Data\" under Item 6, and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included under Item 8 of this report. This discussion contains a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on our current expectations and all of which could be affected by uncertainties and risks. Our actual results may differ materially from the results contemplated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors including, but not limited to, those described in \"Risk Factors\" under Item 1A of this report.\nOverview\nOur Business\nVerint is a global leader in Actionable Intelligence solutions. Actionable Intelligence is a necessity in a dynamic world of massive information growth because it empowers organizations with crucial insights and enables decision makers to anticipate, respond, and take action. With Verint solutions and value-added services, organizations of all sizes and across many industries can make more timely and effective decisions. Today, more than 10,000 organizations in 180 countries, including over 80 percent of the Fortune 100, use Verint solutions to improve enterprise performance and make the world a safer place. Verint's vision is to create A Smarter World with Actionable Intelligence.\nOur Actionable Intelligence solutions help organizations address three important challenges: Customer Engagement Optimization; Security Intelligence; and Fraud, Risk, and Compliance. We help our customers capture large amounts of information from numerous data types and sources, use analytics to glean insights from the information, and leverage the resulting Actionable Intelligence to help achieve their customer engagement, enhanced security, and risk mitigation goals.\nHeadquartered in Melville, New York, we support our customers around the globe directly and with an extensive network of selling and support partners.\nWe conduct our business through three operating segments-Enterprise Intelligence, Cyber Intelligence, and Video Intelligence. Organizing our business through three operating segments allows us to align our resources and domain expertise to more effectively address the Actionable Intelligence market. We address the Customer Engagement Optimization market opportunity through solutions from our Enterprise Intelligence segment. We address the Security Intelligence market\nopportunity through solutions from our Cyber Intelligence segment and Video Intelligence segment, and we address the Fraud, Risk, and Compliance market opportunity through solutions from all three operating segments.\nFor the years ended January 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, our Enterprise Intelligence segment represented approximately 55%, 58%, and 55% of our total revenue, respectively. For the years ended January 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, our Cyber Intelligence segment represented approximately 34%, 32%, and 32% of our total revenue, respectively. For the years ended January 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, our Video Intelligence segment represented approximately 11%, 10%, and 13% of our total revenue, respectively.\nGenerally, we make business decisions by evaluating the risks and rewards of the opportunities available to us in the markets served by each of our segments. We view each operating segment differently and allocate capital, personnel, resources, and management attention accordingly. In reviewing each operating segment, we also review the performance of that segment by geography. Our marketing and sales strategies, expansion opportunities, and product offerings may differ materially within a particular segment geographically, as may our allocation of resources between segments. When making decisions regarding investment in our business, increasing capital expenditures, or making other decisions that may reduce our profitability, we also consider the leverage ratio in our revolving credit facility. See \"- Liquidity and Capital Resources\" for more information.\nKey Trends and Factors That May Impact our Performance\nWe believe that there are many factors that affect our ability to sustain and increase both revenue and profitability, including:\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Market acceptance of Actionable Intelligence solutions. We compete in markets where the value of aspects of our products and solutions is still in the process of market acceptance. Our future growth depends in part on the continued and increasing acceptance and realization of the value of our product offerings. However, we believe that organizations in both the enterprise and security markets want and need Actionable Intelligence solutions to help achieve their customer engagement, enhanced security, and risk mitigation goals.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Evolving technologies and market potential. Our success depends in part on our ability to keep pace with technological changes, customer challenges, and evolving industry standards in our product offerings, successfully developing, launching, and driving demand for new, innovative, high-quality products and services that meet or exceed customer needs, and identifying, entering, and prioritizing areas of growing market potential. For example, in our Security Intelligence business, stronger and more frequent use of encryption has created significantly greater challenges for our customers and for our solutions to address. In the enterprise market, we believe that today's customer-centric organizations are increasingly seeking Customer Engagement Optimization solutions that allow them to collect and analyze intelligence across different service channels to gain a better understanding of the performance of their workforce, the effectiveness of their service processes, the quality of their interactions, and changing customer behaviors, as well as to anticipate and prevent information security breaches, effectively authenticate customers, protect personal information, mitigate risk, prevent fraud, and help ensure compliance with evolving legal, regulatory, and internal requirements. In the security market, we believe that terrorism, criminal activities, cyber-attacks, and other security threats, combined with new and more complex security challenges, including increasingly frequent and sophisticated cyber-attacks and increasingly complex and secure communication networks, are driving demand for Actionable Intelligence solutions to help anticipate, prepare, and respond to these threats.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Information technology and government spending. Our growth and results depend in part on general economic conditions and the pace of information technology spending by both commercial and governmental customers. In the year ended January 31, 2016, we experienced extended sales cycles, particularly for large projects, a reduction in deal sizes, and pressure on maintenance renewals for our Enterprise Intelligence solutions. This trend regarding extended sales cycles and reduced deal sizes was particularly acute for our Security Intelligence business which has significant exposure to emerging markets where budgets have been reduced significantly due to weak economic conditions and currency devaluations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Item 1 of this report for more information on key trends that we believe are driving demand for our solutions and \"Risk Factors\" under Item 1A of this report for a more complete description of risks that may impact future revenue and profitability.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nAn appreciation of our critical accounting policies is necessary to understand our financial results. The accounting policies outlined below are considered to be critical because they can materially affect our operating results and financial condition, as these policies may require us to make difficult and subjective judgments regarding uncertainties. The accuracy of these estimates and the likelihood of future changes depend on a range of possible outcomes and a number of underlying variables, many of which are beyond our control, and there can be no assurance that our estimates are accurate.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue recognition policy is a critical component of determining our operating results and is based on a complex set of accounting rules that require us to make significant judgments and estimates. We derive and report our revenue in two categories: (a) product revenue, including sale of hardware products (which include software that works together with the hardware to deliver the product's essential functionality) and licensing of software products, and (b) service and support revenue, including revenue from installation services, post-contract customer support (\"PCS\"), project management, hosting services, SaaS, application managed services, product warranties, business advisory consulting and training services. Our customer arrangements may include any combination of these elements. We follow the appropriate revenue recognition rules for each of these revenue streams. For additional information, see Note 1, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this report. Revenue recognition for a particular arrangement is dependent upon such factors as the level of customization within the solution and the contractual delivery, acceptance, payment, and support terms with the customer. Significant judgment is required to conclude on each of these factors, and if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments, it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period.\nWe generally consider a purchase order or executed sales quote, when combined with a master license agreement, to constitute evidence of an arrangement. Delivery occurs when the product is shipped or transmitted and title and risk of loss have transferred to the customers. Our typical customer arrangements do not include substantive product acceptance provisions; however, if such provisions are provided, delivery is deemed to occur upon acceptance. We consider the fee to be fixed or determinable unless the fee is subject to refund or adjustment or is not payable within our standard payment terms. If the fee due from a customer is not fixed or determinable due to extended payment terms, revenue is recognized when payment becomes due or upon cash receipt, whichever is earlier.\nOur multiple-element arrangements consist of a combination of our product and service offerings that may be delivered at various points in time. For arrangements within the scope of the multiple-deliverable guidance, a deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has stand-alone value and there are no customer-negotiated refunds or return rights for the delivered elements. For multiple-element arrangements comprised only of tangible products containing software components and non-software components and related services, we allocate revenue to each element in an arrangement based on a selling price hierarchy. The selling price for a deliverable is based on its vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE\u201d), if available, third-party evidence ( TPE\u201d), if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price ( ESP\u201d), if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. The total transaction revenue is allocated to the multiple elements based on each element's relative selling price compared to the total selling price.\nWe account for multiple-element arrangements that contain only software and software-related elements by allocating a portion of the total purchase price to the undelivered elements, primarily installation services, PCS, consulting, and training, using VSOE of fair value of the undelivered elements. The remaining portion of the total transaction value is allocated to the delivered software, referred to as the residual method. If we are unable to establish VSOE for the undelivered elements of the arrangement, revenue recognition is deferred for the entire arrangement until all elements of the arrangement are delivered. However, if the only undelivered element is PCS, we recognize the arrangement fee ratably over the PCS period.\nFor multiple-element arrangements that are comprised of a combination of hardware and software elements, the total transaction value is bifurcated between the hardware elements and the software elements that are not essential to the functionality of the hardware, based on the relative selling prices of the hardware elements and the software elements as a group. Revenue is then recognized for the hardware and hardware-related services following the hardware revenue recognition methodology outlined above and revenue for the software and software-related services is recognized following the residual method or ratably over the PCS period if VSOE for PCS does not exist.\nOur policy for establishing VSOE for installation, business advisory consulting, and training is based upon an analysis of separate sales of services. We utilize either the substantive renewal rate approach or the bell-shaped curve approach to establish VSOE for our PCS offerings, depending upon the business segment, geographical region, or product line. The timing of revenue recognition on software licenses and other revenue could be significantly impacted if we are unable to maintain VSOE on one or more undelivered elements during any quarterly period. Loss of VSOE could result in (i) the complete deferral of all\nrevenue or (ii) ratable recognition of all revenue under a customer arrangement until such time as VSOE is re-established. If we are unable to re-establish VSOE on one or more undelivered elements for an extended period of time it would impact our ability to accurately forecast the timing of quarterly revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe typically are not able to determine TPE for our products or our service and support offerings. TPE of selling price is established by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in stand-alone sales to similarly situated customers.\nIf we are unable to determine the selling price because VSOE or TPE does not exist, we determine ESP for the purposes of allocating the arrangement by considering several external and internal factors including, but not limited to, pricing practices, similar product offerings, margin objectives, geographies in which we offer our products and services, internal costs, competition, and product lifecycle. The determination of ESP is made through consultation with and approval by our management, taking into consideration our go-to-market strategies. We have established processes to update ESP for each element, when appropriate, to ensure that it reflects recent pricing experience.\nPCS revenue is derived from providing technical software support services and unspecified software updates and upgrades to customers on a when-and-if-available basis. PCS revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance period which, in most cases, is one year. When PCS is included within a multiple-element arrangement, we utilize either the substantive renewal rate approach or the bell-shaped curve approach to establish VSOE of the PCS, depending upon the business operating segment, geographical region, or product line.\nUnder the substantive renewal rate approach, we believe it is necessary to evaluate whether both the support renewal rate and term are substantive, and whether the renewal rate is being consistently applied to subsequent renewals for a particular customer. We establish VSOE under this approach through analyzing the renewal rate stated in the customer agreement and determining whether that rate is above the minimum substantive VSOE renewal rate established for that particular PCS offering. The minimum substantive VSOE rate is determined based upon an analysis of renewal rates associated with historical PCS contracts. Typically, renewal rates of 15% for PCS plans that provide when-and-if-available upgrades, and 10% for plans that do not provide for when-and-if-available upgrades, would be deemed to be minimum substantive renewal rates. For contracts that do not contain a stated renewal rate, revenue associated with the entire bundled arrangement is recognized ratably over the PCS term. Contracts that have a renewal rate below the minimum substantive VSOE rate are deemed to contain a more than insignificant discount element, for which VSOE cannot be established. We recognize revenue for these arrangements over the period that the customer is entitled to renew their PCS at the discounted rate, but not to exceed the estimated economic life of the product.\nUnder the bell-shaped curve approach of establishing VSOE, we perform a VSOE compliance test to ensure that a substantial majority (75% or over) of our actual PCS renewals are within a narrow range of plus or minus 15% of the median pricing.\nSome of our arrangements require significant customization of the product to meet the particular requirements of the customer. For these arrangements, revenue is recognized under contract accounting methods, typically using the percentage of completion (\"POC\") method. Under the POC method, revenue recognition is generally based upon the ratio of hours incurred to date to the total estimated hours required to complete the contract. Profit estimates on long-term contracts are revised periodically based on changes in circumstances, and any losses on contracts are recognized in the period that such losses become evident. Generally, the terms of long-term contracts provide for progress billings based on completion of milestones or other defined phases of work. Significant judgment is often required when estimating total hours and progress to completion on these arrangements, as well as whether a loss is expected to be incurred on the contract due to several factors including the degree of customization required and the customer's existing environment. We use historical experience, project plans, and an assessment of the risks and uncertainties inherent in the arrangement to establish these estimates. Uncertainties in these arrangements include implementation delays or performance issues that may or may not be within our control.\nOur SaaS offerings generally provide customers access to certain of our software within a cloud-based information technology environment that we manage and offer to customers on a subscription basis. We recognize revenue for subscription and related support services over the contract period originating when the subscription service is made available to the customer and the contractual hosting period has commenced.\nOur application managed services revenue is derived from providing services that enhance our customers IT processes and maximize the business benefits of our solutions. Application managed services revenue is recognized ratably over the applicable term which, in most cases, is at least one year. When application managed services is included within a multiple-\nelement arrangement, we utilize the substantive renewal rate approach to establish VSOE. In addition, we perform a budget versus actual time analysis to support our initial estimate of effort required to provide these services.\nWe extend customary trade payment terms to our customers in the normal course of conducting business. To assess the probability of collection for purposes of revenue recognition, we have established credit policies that establish prudent credit limits for our customers. These credit limits are based upon our risk assessment of the customer's ability to pay, their payment history, geographic risk, and other factors, and are not contingent upon the resale of the product or upon the collection of payments from their customers. These credit limits are reviewed and revised periodically on the basis of updated customer financial statement information, payment performance, and other factors. When a customer is not deemed creditworthy, revenue is recognized when payment is received.\nWe record provisions for estimated product returns in the same period in which the associated revenue is recognized. We base these estimates of product returns upon historical levels of sales returns and other known factors. Actual product returns could be different from our estimates and current or future provisions for product returns may differ from historical provisions. Concessions granted to customers are recorded as reductions to revenue in the period in which they were granted and have been minimal in both amount and frequency.\nProduct revenue derived from shipments to resellers and OEMs who purchase our products for resale are generally recognized when such products are shipped (on a \"sell-in\" basis) since we do not expect our resellers or OEMs to carry inventory of our products. This policy is predicated on our ability to estimate sales returns as well as other criteria regarding these customers. We are also required to evaluate whether our resellers and OEMs have the ability to honor their commitment to make fixed or determinable payments regardless of whether they collect payment from their customers. In this regard, we assess whether our resellers and OEMs are new, poorly capitalized, or experiencing financial difficulty, and whether they have a pattern of not paying as amounts become due on previous arrangements or seeking payment terms longer than those provided to end customers. If we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments, it could cause a material change to the revenue reported in a particular period. We have historically experienced insignificant product returns from resellers and OEMs, and our payment terms for these customers are similar to those granted to our end-users. Our policy also presumes that we have no significant performance obligations in connection with the sale of our products by our resellers and OEMs to their customers. If a reseller or OEM develops a pattern of payment delinquency, or seeks payment terms longer than generally granted to our resellers or OEMs, we defer the recognition of revenue from transactions with that reseller or OEM until the receipt of cash.\nMultiple contracts with a single counterparty executed within close proximity of each other are evaluated to determine if the contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single arrangement. We record reimbursements from customers for out-of-pocket expenses as revenue. Shipping and handling fees and expenses that are billed to customers are recognized in revenue and the costs associated with such fees and expenses are recorded in cost of revenue. Historically, these fees and expenses have not been material. Taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities are excluded from revenue.\nFor multiple-element arrangements that contain software and software related elements for which we are unable to establish VSOE of one or more elements, we use various available indicators of fair value and apply our best judgment to reasonably classify the arrangement's revenue into product revenue and service revenue for financial reporting purposes.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe estimate the collectability of our accounts receivable balances each accounting period and adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts accordingly. We exercise a considerable amount of judgment in assessing the collectability of accounts receivable, including consideration of the creditworthiness of each customer, their collection history, and the related aging of past due accounts receivable balances. We evaluate specific accounts when we learn that a customer may be experiencing a deterioration of its financial condition due to lower credit ratings, bankruptcy, or other factors that may affect its ability to render payment.\nAccounting for Business Combinations\nWe allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired, including in-process research and development assets, and liabilities assumed, based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. These fair values are typically estimated with assistance from independent valuation specialists. The purchase price allocation process requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets, contractual support obligations assumed, and pre-acquisition contingencies.\nAlthough we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain.\nExamples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to:\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>future expected cash flows from software license sales, support agreements, consulting contracts, other customer contracts, and acquired developed technologies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>expected costs to develop in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the acquired company's brand and competitive position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company's product portfolio;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>cost of capital and discount rates; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>estimating the useful lives of acquired assets as well as the pattern or manner in which the assets will amortize.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn connection with the purchase price allocations for applicable acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of the contractual support obligations we are assuming from the acquired business. The estimated fair value of the support obligations is determined utilizing a cost build-up approach, which determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a reasonable profit margin. The estimated costs to fulfill the support obligations are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the support services. The sum of these costs and operating profit represents an approximation of the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the support obligations.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nWe test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which can be an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, on an annual basis as of November 1, or more frequently if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that impairment in the value of goodwill may exist. As of January 31, 2016, our reporting units are consistent with our operating segments identified in Note 17, \"Segment, Geographic, and Significant Customer Information\" to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this report.\nWe review goodwill for impairment utilizing either a qualitative assessment or a two-step process. If we decide that it is appropriate to perform a qualitative assessment and conclude that the fair value of a reporting unit more likely than not exceeds its carrying value, no further evaluation is necessary. For reporting units where we perform the two-step process, the first step requires us to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit and compare that fair value to the respective carrying value, which includes goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill is not considered impaired and no further evaluation is necessary. If the carrying value is higher than the estimated fair value, there is an indication that impairment may exist and the second step is required. In the second step, the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated as the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the fair values assigned to its assets and liabilities. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill, the difference is recognized as an impairment charge.\nFor reporting units where we decide to perform a qualitative assessment, we assess and make judgments regarding a variety of factors which potentially impact the fair value of a reporting unit, including general economic conditions, industry and market-specific conditions, customer behavior, cost factors, our financial performance and trends, our strategies and business plans, capital requirements, management and personnel issues, and our stock price, among others. We then consider the totality of these and other factors, placing more weight on the events and circumstances that are judged to most affect a reporting unit's fair value or the carrying amount of its net assets, to reach a qualitative conclusion regarding whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount.\nFor reporting units where we perform the two-step process, we utilize some or all of three primary approaches to assess fair value: (a) an income-based approach, using projected discounted cash flows, (b) a market-based approach, using multiples of comparable companies, and (c) a transaction-based approach, using multiples for recent acquisitions of similar businesses made in the marketplace.\nOur estimate of fair value of each reporting unit is based on a number of subjective factors, including: (a) appropriate consideration of valuation approaches (income approach, comparable public company approach, and comparable transaction approach), (b) estimates of future growth rates, (c) estimates of our future cost structure, (d) discount rates for our estimated\ncash flows, (e) selection of peer group companies for the comparable public company and the comparable transaction approaches, (f) required levels of working capital, (g) assumed terminal value, and (h) time horizon of cash flow forecasts.\nThe determination of reporting units also requires judgment. We assess whether a reporting unit exists within a reportable segment by identifying the unit, determining whether the unit qualifies as a business under GAAP, and assessing the availability and regular review by segment management of discrete financial information for the unit.\nWe review intangible assets that have finite useful lives and other long-lived assets when an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment. If any indicators are present, we perform a recoverability test by comparing the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets in question to their carrying amounts. If the undiscounted cash flows used in the test for recoverability are less than the long-lived assets carrying amount, we determine the fair value of the long-lived asset and recognize an impairment loss if the carrying amount of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. The impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.\nFor all of our goodwill and other intangible asset impairment reviews, the assumptions and estimates used in the process are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts. Although we believe the assumptions, judgments, and estimates we have used in our assessments are reasonable and appropriate, a material change in any of our assumptions or external factors could lead to future goodwill or other intangible asset impairment charges.\nBased upon our November 1, 2015 goodwill impairment reviews, we concluded that the estimated fair values of our Enterprise Intelligence, Cyber Intelligence, and Video Intelligence reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying values.\nOur Enterprise Intelligence, Cyber Intelligence, and Video Intelligence reporting units carried goodwill of $1.0 billion, $120.7 million, and $37.5 million, respectively, at January 31, 2016.\nWe did not record any impairments of goodwill for the years ended January 31, 2016, 2015, or 2014.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method which includes the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in our consolidated financial statements. Under this approach, deferred taxes are recorded for the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. The provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus deferred taxes. Deferred taxes result from differences between the financial statement and tax bases of our assets and liabilities, and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. The effects of future changes in income tax laws or rates are not anticipated.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The calculation of our tax provision involves the application of complex tax laws and requires significant judgment and estimates.\nWe evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets for each jurisdiction in which we operate at each reporting date, and we establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income of the same character and in the same jurisdiction. We consider all available positive and negative evidence in making this assessment, including, but not limited to, the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. In circumstances where there is sufficient negative evidence indicating that our deferred tax assets are not more likely than not realizable, we establish a valuation allowance.\nWe use a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by assessing whether they are more likely than not sustainable, based solely on their technical merits, upon examination, and including resolution of any related appeals or litigation process. The second step is to measure the associated tax benefit of each position as the largest amount that we believe is more likely than not realizable. Differences between the amount of tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in our income tax returns and the amount of tax benefits recognized in our financial statements represent our unrecognized income tax benefits, which we either record as a liability or as a reduction of deferred tax assets. Our policy is to include interest (expense and/or income) and penalties related to unrecognized income tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes.\nContingencies\nWe recognize an estimated loss from a claim or loss contingency when and if information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Accounting for claims and contingencies requires the use of significant judgment and estimates. One notable potential source of loss contingencies is pending or threatened litigation. Legal counsel and other advisors and experts are consulted on issues related to litigation as well as on matters related to contingencies occurring in the ordinary course of business.\nAccounting for Stock-Based Compensation\nWe recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award.\nDuring the three-year period ended January 31, 2016, restricted stock units were our predominant stock-based payment award. The fair value of these awards is equivalent to the market value of our common stock on the grant date. In the past, we have also awarded stock options, the fair value of which is estimated on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for this purpose, which requires the input of significant assumptions including an estimate of the average period of time employees will retain stock options before exercising them, the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term, the number of options that will ultimately be forfeited before completing vesting requirements, and the risk-free interest rate.\nWe periodically award restricted stock units that vest upon the achievement of specified performance goals. Our estimate of the fair value of these performance-based awards requires an assessment of the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved. At each reporting date, we update our assessment of the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved and adjust our estimate of the fair value of the award, if necessary.\nChanges in assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock-based compensation and, consequently, the related expense recognized. The assumptions we use in calculating the fair value of stock-based payment awards represent our best estimates, which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\nCost of Revenue\nWe have made an accounting policy election whereby certain costs of product revenue, including hardware and third-party software license fees, are capitalized and amortized over the same period that product revenue is recognized, while installation and other service costs are generally expensed as incurred, except for certain contracts recognized according to contract accounting.\nFor example, in a multiple-element arrangement where revenue is recognized over the PCS support period, the cost of revenue associated with the product is capitalized upon product delivery and amortized over that same period. However, the cost of revenue associated with the services is expensed as incurred in the period in which the services are performed. In addition, we expense customer acquisition and origination costs to selling, general and administrative expense, including sales commissions, as incurred, with the exception of certain sales referral fees in our Cyber Intelligence segment which are capitalized and amortized ratably over the revenue recognition period.\nResults of Operations\nSeasonality and Cyclicality\nAs is typical for many software and technology companies, our business is subject to seasonal and cyclical factors. In most years, our revenue and operating income are typically highest in the fourth quarter and lowest in the first quarter (prior to the impact of unusual or nonrecurring items). Moreover, revenue and operating income in the first quarter of a new year may be lower than in the fourth quarter of the preceding year, in some years, by a significant margin. In addition, we generally receive a higher volume of orders in the last month of a quarter, with orders concentrated in the later part of that month. We believe that these seasonal and cyclical factors primarily reflect customer spending patterns and budget cycles, as well as the impact of incentive compensation plans for our sales personnel. While seasonal and cyclical factors such as these are common in the software and technology industry, this pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future revenue or financial performance. Many other factors, including general economic conditions, may also have an impact on our business and financial results.\nOverview of Operating Results\nThe following table sets forth a summary of certain key financial information for the years ended January 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014: Table 115: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended January 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands, except per share data)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,130,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,128,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>907,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67,852\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>122,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to Verint Systems Inc. common shares\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,638\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,583\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income per common share attributable to Verint Systems Inc.:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Basic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.01\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Diluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.52\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.99\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended January 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2015. Our revenue increased approximately $1.9 million to $1,130.3 million in the year ended January 31, 2016 from $1,128.4 million in the year ended January 31, 2015. The increase consisted of a $34.1 million increase in service and support revenue, offset by a $32.2 million decrease in product revenue. In our Cyber Intelligence segment, revenue increased approximately $26.0 million, or 7%, from $359.4 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 to $385.4 million in the year ended January 31, 2016. The increase consisted of a $31.0 million increase in service and support revenue and a $5.0 million decrease in product revenue. In our Video Intelligence segment, revenue increased approximately $8.5 million, or 8%, from $110.4 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 to $118.9 million in the year ended January 31, 2016, primarily due to an increase in product revenue. In our Enterprise Intelligence segment, revenue decreased approximately $32.8 million, or 5%, to $625.9 million in the year ended January 31, 2016 from $658.7 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 due to a decrease in product revenue. For additional details on our revenue by segment, see \"-Revenue by Operating Segment\". Revenue in the Americas, EMEA, and APAC represented approximately 51%, 31%, and 18% of our total revenue, respectively, in the year ended January 31, 2016, compared to approximately 52%, 31%, and 17%, respectively, in the year ended January 31, 2015. Further details of changes in revenue are provided below.\nOperating income was $67.9 million in the year ended January 31, 2016 compared to $79.1 million in the year ended January 31, 2015. This decrease in operating income was primarily due to an $11.9 million decrease in gross profit primarily due to decreased gross profit in our Enterprise Intelligence segment and a $0.7 million decrease in operating expenses, which consisted of a $4.0 million increase in net research and development expenses, offset by a $2.6 million decrease in selling, general and administrative expense and a $2.1 million decrease in amortization of other acquired intangible assets. Further details of changes in operating income are provided below.\nNet income attributable to Verint Systems Inc. common shares was $17.6 million, and diluted net income per common share was $0.28, in the year ended January 31, 2016 compared to net income attributable to Verint Systems Inc. common shares of $30.9 million, and diluted net income per common share of $0.52, in the year ended January 31, 2015. The decrease in net income attributable to Verint Systems Inc. and diluted net income per common share in the year ended January 31, 2016 was primarily due to a $16.0 million decrease in our benefit for income taxes, from a benefit of $15.0 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 to an expense of $1.0 million in the year ended January 31, 2016, and decreased operating income, as described above. These decreases to net income attributable to Verint Systems Inc. common shares were partially offset by a $13.0 million decrease in other expense, net, primarily due to losses upon early retirement of debt recorded during the year ended January 31, 2015, with no comparable losses during the year ended January 31, 2016. Further details of changes in total other expense, net, are provided below.\nA portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and therefore our revenue and operating expenses are affected by fluctuations in applicable foreign currency exchange rates. When comparing average exchange rates for the year ended January 31, 2016 to average exchange rates for the year ended January 31, 2015, the U.S. dollar strengthened relative to the British pound sterling, euro, Israeli shekel (both hedged and unhedged), Australian dollar, Brazilian real, and Singapore dollar, resulting in an overall decrease in our revenue (primarily in our Enterprise Intelligence and Cyber Intelligence segments), cost of revenue, and operating expenses on a U.S. dollar-denominated basis. For the year ended January 31, 2016, had foreign exchange rates remained unchanged from rates in effect for the year ended January 31, 2015, our revenue would have been approximately $40.0 million higher and our cost of revenue and operating expenses on a combined basis would have been approximately $44.6 million higher, which would have resulted in a $4.6 million decrease in operating income.\nCurrently, we employ approximately 5,000 professionals, including part-time employees and certain contractors, as compared to approximately 4,800 at January 31, 2015.\nYear Ended January 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2014. Our revenue increased approximately $221.1 million, or 24%, to $1,128.4 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 from $907.3 million in the year ended January 31, 2014. In our Enterprise Intelligence segment, revenue increased approximately $159.8 million, or 32%, to $658.7 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 from $498.9 million in the year ended January 31, 2014. The increase consisted of a $132.9 million increase in service and support revenue and a $26.9 million increase in product revenue. In our Cyber Intelligence segment, revenue increased approximately $71.4 million, or 25%, from $288.0 million in the year ended January 31, 2014 to $359.4 million in the year ended January 31, 2015. The increase consisted of a $54.9 million increase in product revenue and a $16.5 million increase in service and support revenue. In our Video Intelligence segment, revenue decreased approximately $10.0 million, or 8%, from $120.4 million in the year ended January 31, 2014 to $110.4 million in the year ended January 31, 2015, primarily due to a decrease in product revenue. For additional details on our revenue by segment, see \"-Revenue by Operating Segment\". Revenue in the Americas, EMEA, and APAC represented approximately 52%, 31%, and 17% of our total revenue, respectively, in the year ended January 31, 2015, compared to approximately 56%, 20%, and 24%, respectively, in the year ended January 31, 2014. The change in the percentage of revenue by geographical region in the year ended January 31, 2015 compared to the year ended January 31, 2014 primarily reflected the timing of revenue recognized in those regions under several large contracts, primarily in our Cyber Intelligence segment. Further details of changes in revenue are provided below.\nOperating income was $79.1 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 compared to $122.3 million in the year ended January 31, 2014. This decrease in operating income was primarily due to a $155.6 million increase in operating expenses, from $478.6 million to $634.2 million, partially offset by a $112.4 million increase in gross profit from $600.9 million to $713.3 million. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to increased gross profit in our Enterprise Intelligence and Communication Intelligence segments. Despite the increase in gross profit, our overall gross margin decreased from 66% in the year ended January 31, 2014 to 63% in the year ended January 31, 2015 primarily due to a change in the mix of services attributable to a business combination in our Enterprise Intelligence segment that closed during the year ended January 31, 2015. The increase in operating expenses consisted of an $87.9 million increase in selling, general and administrative expense, a $47.2 million increase in net research and development expenses, and a $20.5 million increase in amortization of other acquired intangible assets. Further details of changes in operating income are provided below.\nNet income attributable to Verint Systems Inc. common shares was $30.9 million, and diluted net income per common share was $0.52, in the year ended January 31, 2015 compared to net income attributable to Verint Systems Inc. common shares of $53.6 million, and diluted net income per common share of $0.99, in the year ended January 31, 2014. The decrease in net income attributable to Verint Systems Inc. common shares and diluted net income per common share in the year ended January 31, 2015 was primarily due to our decreased operating income, as described above, a $6.9 million increase in interest expense, and a $2.6 million increase in losses upon early retirement of debt recorded during year ended January 31, 2015 compared to the year ended January 31, 2014. These decreases to net income attributable to Verint Systems Inc. common shares were partially offset by and a $19.5 million decrease in our (benefit) provision for income taxes and a $10.7 million decrease in other expense, net. During the year ended January 31, 2015, other expense, net, included net foreign currency losses of $13.4 million, partially offset by net gains on derivative instruments of $4.0 million. During the year ended January 31, 2014, other expense, net, included a charge of $12.9 million for the derecognition of an indemnification asset associated with the resolution of an uncertain tax position previously recorded in connection with the CTI Merger and net foreign currency losses of $6.1 million. Further details of changes in total other expense, net, are provided below.\nWhen comparing average exchange rates for the year ended January 31, 2015 to average exchange rates for the year ended January 31, 2014, while the U.S. dollar weakened relative to the British pound sterling and our hedged Israeli shekel rate, it strengthened relative to the euro, Australian dollar, Japanese yen, Brazilian real, and Singapore dollar, resulting in an overall decrease in our revenue and cost of revenue. For operating expenses, the impact of the weakened U.S. dollar relative to the British pound sterling and our hedged Israeli shekel rate was greater than the impact of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, Australian dollar, Japanese yen, Brazilian real, and Singapore dollar, resulting in an increase in operating expenses on a U.S. dollar-denominated basis. For the year ended January 31, 2015, had foreign exchange rates remained unchanged from rates in effect for the year ended January 31, 2014, our revenue would have been approximately $4.2 million higher and our cost of revenue and operating expenses on a combined basis would have been approximately $3.8 million lower, which would have resulted in a $8.0 million increase in operating income.\nAs of January 31, 2015, we employed approximately 4,800 employees, including part-time employees and certain contractors, as compared to approximately 3,400 at January 31, 2014. This increase was due to a combination of acquisitions and organic growth during the twelve months ended January 31, 2015.\nRevenue by Operating Segment\nThe following table sets forth revenue for each of our three operating segments for the years ended January 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014: Table 116: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 - 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 - 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Enterprise Intelligence\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>625,943\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>658,671\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>498,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cyber Intelligence\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>385,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>359,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>288,003\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Video Intelligence\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>118,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>110,370\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>120,388\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,130,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,128,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>907,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEnterprise Intelligence Segment\nYear Ended January 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2015. Enterprise Intelligence revenue decreased approximately $32.8 million, or 5%, from $658.7 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 to $625.9 million in the year ended January 31, 2016. The decrease consisted of a $31.9 million decrease in product revenue and a $0.9 million decrease in service and support revenue. The decrease in product revenue primarily reflects a lower aggregate value of executed license arrangements, which comprises the majority of our product revenue and which can fluctuate from period to period. The decrease in service and support revenue was primarily due to a decrease in revenue from professional services and consulting projects in the year ended January 31, 2016, partially offset by an increase in support revenue. As mentioned above, our revenue during the year ended January 31, 2016 was also adversely affected by the impact of the strengthening of the U.S dollar relative to foreign locations currencies where we conduct business.\nYear Ended January 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2014. Enterprise Intelligence revenue increased approximately $159.8 million, or 32%, from $498.9 million in the year ended January 31, 2014 to $658.7 million in the year ended January 31, 2015. The increase consisted of a $132.9 million increase in service and support revenue and a $26.9 million increase in product revenue. The increase in service and support revenue was primarily due to an increase in our customer install base, both organically and through business combinations, and the related support revenue generated from this customer base during the year ended January 31, 2015, as well as increased revenue from new service offerings in the year ended January 31, 2015. The increase in product revenue was due to an increase in product sales to new customers during the year ended January 31, 2015. The growth of service revenue relative to product revenue was attributable to various factors, including an increase in services associated with customer product upgrades, a higher component of service offerings in our standard arrangements, and growth in our install base, both organically and as a result of business combinations, through the end of such period.\nCyber Intelligence Segment\nYear Ended January 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2015. Cyber Intelligence revenue increased approximately $26.0 million, or 7%, from $359.4 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 to $385.4 million in the year ended January 31, 2016. The increase consisted of a $31.0 million increase in service and support revenue, partially offset by a $5.0 million decrease in product revenue. The increase in service and support revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in progress realized during the current year on projects with revenue recognized using the percentage of completion (\"POC\") method, some of which commenced in the previous fiscal year, and an increase in support revenue from new and existing customers. The decrease in product revenue was primarily due to a decrease in product deliveries to customers, partially offset by an increase in progress realized during the current year on projects with revenue recognized using the POC method, some of which commenced in the previous fiscal year. As mentioned above, our revenue during the year ended January 31, 2016 was also adversely affected by the impact of the strengthening of the U.S dollar relative to the currencies used in the foreign locations where we conduct business.\nYear Ended January 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2014. Cyber Intelligence revenue increased approximately $71.4 million, or 25%, from $288.0 million in the year ended January 31, 2014 to $359.4 million in the year ended January 31, 2015. The increase consisted of a $54.9 million increase in product revenue and a $16.5 million increase in service and support revenue. The increase in product revenue was primarily due to an increase in product deliveries to customers and an increase in progress realized during the year ended January 31, 2015 on projects with revenue recognized using the POC method, some of which commenced in the previous fiscal year. The increase in service and support revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in progress realized during the year ended January 31, 2015 on projects with revenue recognized using the POC\nmethod, some of which commenced in the previous fiscal year, and an increase in revenue from software-as-a-service (\"SaaS\") offerings.\nVideo Intelligence Segment\nYear Ended January 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2015. Video Intelligence revenue increased approximately $8.5 million, or 8%, from $110.4 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 to $118.9 million in the year ended January 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in product deliveries to customers during the year ended January 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended January 31, 2015.\nYear Ended January 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2014. Video Intelligence revenue decreased approximately $10.0 million, or 8%, from $120.4 million in the year ended January 31, 2014 to $110.4 million in the year ended January 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in sales of certain hardware products to a single large customer during the year ended January 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended January 31, 2014.\nVolume and Price\nWe sell products in multiple configurations, and the price of any particular product varies depending on the configuration of the product sold. Due to the variety of customized configurations for each product we sell, we are unable to quantify the amount of any revenue increase attributable to a change in the price of any particular product and/or a change in the number of products sold.\nProduct Revenue and Service and Support Revenue\nWe derive and report our revenue in two categories: (a) product revenue, including licensing of software products and sale of hardware products (which include software that works together with the hardware to deliver the product's essential functionality), and (b) service and support revenue, including revenue from installation services, post-contract customer support, project management, hosting services, SaaS, application managed services, product warranties, and business advisory consulting and training services. For multiple-element arrangements for which we are unable to establish VSOE for one or more elements, we use various available indicators of fair value and apply our best judgment to reasonably classify the arrangement's revenue into product revenue and service and support revenue.\nThe following table sets forth product revenue and service and support revenue for the years ended January 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014:\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 - 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 - 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>455,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>487,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>416,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service and support revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>674,860\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>640,819\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>490,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,130,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,128,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>907,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduct Revenue\nYear Ended January 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2015.

When revenue is deferred, we also defer hardware material costs and third-party software royalties and recognize those costs over the same period that the product revenue is recognized. Cost of product revenue also includes amortization of capitalized software development costs, employee compensation and related expenses associated with our global operations, facility costs, and other allocated overhead expenses. In our Cyber Intelligence segment, cost of product revenue also includes employee compensation and related expenses, contractor and consulting expenses, and travel expenses, in each case for resources dedicated to project management and associated product delivery.\nOur product gross margins are impacted by the mix of products that we sell from period to period. As with many other technology companies, our software products tend to have higher gross margins than our hardware products.\nYear Ended January 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2015. Cost of product revenue remained relatively unchanged at $145.1 million for the year ended January 31, 2016 compared to $144.9 million for the year ended January 31, 2015. For the year ended January 31, 2016, we recorded a $3.2 million charge for the impairment of certain technology assets associated with a prior business combination in our Cyber Intelligence segment. For the year ended January 31, 2015, we recorded a $2.6 million charge for the impairment of certain capitalized software development costs, reflecting strategy changes in certain product development initiatives in our Cyber Intelligence segment as a result of the UTX acquisition. Our overall product gross margins decreased to 68% in the year ended January 31, 2016 from 70% in the year ended January 31, 2015. As noted above, certain costs are not allocated to our operating segments when we calculate product gross margins by operating segment. Product gross margins in our Enterprise Intelligence segment decreased to 93% in the year ended January 31, 2016 from 94% in the year ended January 31, 2015. Product gross margins in our Cyber Intelligence segment increased from 61% in the year ended January 31, 2015 to 62% in the year ended January 31, 2016. Product gross margins in our Video Intelligence segment increased to 60% in the year ended January 31, 2016 from 59% in the year ended January 31, 2015. The above changes in product gross margins are primarily attributable to changes in product mix in the year ended January 31, 2016 compared to the year ended January 31, 2015.\nYear Ended January 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2014. Cost of product revenue increased approximately 5% from $137.6 million in the year ended January 31, 2014 to $144.9 million in the year ended January 31, 2015. Our overall\nproduct gross margins increased to 70% in the year ended January 31, 2015 from 67% in the year ended January 31, 2014. Product gross margins in our Enterprise Intelligence segment increased from 92% in the year ended January 31, 2014 to 94% in the year ended January 31, 2015 primarily due to a continued decrease in hardware sales as part of our product offerings. Product gross margins in our Cyber Intelligence segment increased from 56% in the year ended January 31, 2014 to 61% in the year ended January 31, 2015 primarily due to a change in product mix. Product gross margins in our Video Intelligence segment increased to 59% in the year ended January 31, 2015 compared to 58% in the year ended January 31, 2014 due to a change in product mix.\nCost of Service and Support Revenue\nCost of service and support revenue primarily consists of employee compensation and related expenses, contractor costs, and travel expenses relating to installation, training, application managed services, consulting, and maintenance services. Cost of service and support revenue also includes stock-based compensation expenses, facility costs, and other overhead expenses. In accordance with GAAP and our accounting policy, the cost of service and support revenue is generally expensed as incurred in the period in which the services are performed, with the exception of certain transactions accounted for using the POC method.\nYear Ended January 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2015. Cost of service and support revenue increased approximately 4% from $239.3 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 to $248.1 million in the year ended January 31, 2016. The increase is primarily attributable to an $11.3 million increase in employee compensation and related expenses due primarily to increased services and support employee headcount chiefly in our Cyber Intelligence segment, and a $3.4 million increase in contractor costs due to increase use of contractors in our Cyber Intelligence and Enterprise Intelligence segments during the year ended January 31, 2016 compared to the year ended January 31, 2015. These increases were partially offset by a $2.4 million decrease in travel expenses primarily in our Enterprise Intelligence segment and a $1.3 million decrease in materials expense incurred to provide services primarily in our Enterprise Intelligence segment. Our overall service and support gross margins were 63% in each of the years ended January 31, 2016 and 2015.\nYear Ended January 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2014. Cost of service and support revenue increased approximately 53% from $156.6 million in the year ended January 31, 2014 to $239.3 million in the year ended January 31, 2015. Employee compensation and related expenses increased $51.3 million due primarily to increased headcount in our Enterprise Intelligence segment in connection with a business combination that closed during the year ended January 31, 2015. Contractor costs, travel expense, and materials expense incurred to provide services increased $10.2 million, $5.2 million, and $8.2 million, respectively, primarily due to a business combination that closed during the year ended January 31, 2015 in our Enterprise Intelligence segment. Stock-based compensation expense increased $3.4 million resulting from an increase in average amounts of outstanding restricted stock units, and increases in our stock price during such period, which impacted the total stock-based compensation to be recognized over the vesting periods. Our overall service and support gross margins decreased from 68% in the year ended January 31, 2014 to 63% in the year ended January 31, 2015 primarily due to a change in the mix of services in connection with a business combination that closed during the year ended January 31, 2015 in our Enterprise Intelligence segment.\nAmortization of Acquired Technology and Backlog\nAmortization of acquired technology and backlog consists of amortization of technology assets and customer backlog acquired in connection with business combinations.\nYear Ended January 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2015. Amortization of acquired technology and backlog increased approximately 15% from $31.0 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 to $35.8 million in the year ended January 31, 2016 primarily due to an increase in amortization expense of acquired technology-based intangible assets associated with business combinations that closed during the year ended January 31, 2016.\nYear Ended January 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2014. Amortization of acquired technology and backlog increased approximately 153% from $12.3 million in the year ended January 31, 2014 to $31.0 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 primarily due to an increase in amortization expense of acquired technology-based intangible assets associated with business combinations that closed during the year ended January 31, 2015.\nFurther discussion regarding our business combinations appears in Note 4, \"Business Combinations\" to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this report.\nResearch and Development, Net\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and subcontracting expenses, facility costs, and other allocated overhead, net of certain software development costs that are capitalized, as well as reimbursements under government programs. Software development costs are capitalized upon the establishment of technological feasibility and continue to be capitalized through the general release of the related software product.\nThe following table sets forth research and development, net for the years ended January 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014:\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 - 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 - 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>177,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>173,748\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>126,539\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended January 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2015. Research and development, net increased approximately $4.0 million, or 2%, from $173.7 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 to $177.7 million in the year ended January 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to a $2.8 million increase in stock-based compensation expense due to a combination of an increase in the number of outstanding RSUs, higher expenses associated with performance-based RSUs, and higher grant-date stock prices during the year ended January 31, 2016 (which are used to determine the grant-date fair value of an RSU), and our bonus share program, further details for which appear in Note 13, \"Stock-Based Compensation\" to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this report. Contractor expenses increased $0.8 million due to increased use of contractors for research and development activities in our Cyber Intelligence segment during the year ended January 31, 2016 compared to the year ended January 31, 2015. Research and development reimbursements received from government programs decreased $1.1 million during the year ended January 31, 2016, primarily in our Enterprise Intelligence segment, resulting in an increase in research and development expense compared to the year ended January 31, 2015. These increases were partially offset by a $0.9 million decrease in employee compensation and related expenses due to decreased research and development employee headcount in our Enterprise Intelligence segment.\nYear Ended January 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2014. Research and development, net increased approximately $47.2 million, or 37%, from $126.5 million in the year ended January 31, 2014 to $173.7 million in the year ended January 31, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to a $37.0 million increase in employee compensation and related expenses due to an increase in employee headcount in connection with business combinations that closed during the year ended January 31, 2015 in our Enterprise Intelligence and Communication Intelligence segments. Stock-based compensation expense increased $3.0 million resulting from an increase in average amounts of outstanding restricted stock units, and an increase in our stock price during such period (which impacted the total stock-based compensation to be recognized over the vesting periods). Contractor expense increased $2.4 million due to increased use of contractors for research and development activities in our Cyber Intelligence segment during the year ended January 31, 2015 compared to the year ended January 31, 2014.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and related expenses, professional fees, sales and marketing expenses, including travel, sales commissions and sales referral fees, facility costs, communication expenses, and other administrative expenses.\nThe following table sets forth selling, general and administrative expenses for the years ended January 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014:\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 - 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 - 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>412,728\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>415,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>327,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended January 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2015. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased approximately $2.6 million, or 1%, from $415.3 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 to $412.7 million in the year ended January 31, 2016. Sales commissions expense decreased $3.8 million due primarily to decreased product bookings in our Enterprise Intelligence segment. Employee compensation and related expenses decreased $2.8 million due primarily to a decrease in headcount of general and administrative employees in our Enterprise Intelligence segment. Accounting, legal, and other professional service fees decreased $2.3 million primarily due to higher use of such services during the year ended January 31, 2015 as a result of services provided in connection with the KANA and UTX acquisitions. Travel expenses decreased $2.1 million due primarily to decreased travel expenses in our Enterprise Intelligence segment. The change in fair\nvalue of our obligations under contingent consideration arrangements was a $0.9 million benefit during the year ended January 31, 2016 compared to $0.9 million expense during the year ended January 31, 2015, resulting in a $1.8 million decrease in selling, general, and administrative expense. These decreases were partially offset by increases of $6.4 million and $2.5 million in stock-based compensation expense and facilities expenses, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense increased primarily due to a combination of an increase in the number of outstanding RSUs, higher expenses associated with performance-based RSUs, and higher grant-date stock prices during the year ended January 31, 2016 (which are used to determine the grant-date fair value of an RSU), and our bonus share program, further details for which appear in Note 13, \"Stock-Based Compensation\" to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this report. Facilities expenses increased due primarily to the early termination of a facility lease in the Americas region, and costs associated with entering our new headquarters in Melville, NY.\nYear Ended January 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2014. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately $87.9 million, or 27%, from $327.4 million in the year ended January 31, 2014 to $415.3 million in the year ended January 31, 2015. Employee compensation and related expenses increased $34.5 million due primarily to increased employee headcount in our Enterprise Intelligence and Cyber Intelligence segments, as well as an increase in employee headcount for corporate support employees. Stock-based compensation expense increased $12.6 million due primarily to an increase in average amounts of outstanding restricted stock units, and an increase in our stock price during the period (which impacted the total stock-based compensation to be recognized over the vesting periods). Sales and marketing expense, travel expense, and facilities expense increased $3.8 million, $4.0 million, and $6.4 million, respectively, due primarily to business combinations that closed during the year ended January 31. 2015. Also contributing to the increase in selling, general, and administrative expense was a $9.9 million increase in agent commissions expense in our Communication Intelligence segment, a $5.6 million increase in contractor expense due primarily to increased use of contractors for corporate support activities, including acquisition and integration related expenses, and a $3.5 million increase in the change in fair value of our obligations under contingent consideration arrangements. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $3.5 million in expenses from special performance incentives associated with a prior period business combination that were included in selling, general, and administrative expenses for the year ended January 31, 2014 with no equivalent expenses in the year ended January 31, 2015.\nAmortization of Other Acquired Intangible Assets\nAmortization of other acquired intangible assets consists of amortization of certain intangible assets acquired in connection with business combinations, including customer relationships, distribution networks, trade names and non-compete agreements.\nThe following table sets forth amortization of other acquired intangible assets for the years ended January 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014:\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 - 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 - 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of other acquired intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,662\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended January 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2015. Amortization of other acquired intangible assets decreased approximately $2.1 million, or 5%, from $45.2 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 to $43.1 million in the year ended January 31, 2016 primarily due to acquired intangible assets from historical business combinations becoming fully amortized during the year ended January 31, 2016, resulting in decreased amortization on those intangibles compared to the year ended January 31, 2015. This decrease was partially offset by amortization associated with business combinations that closed during the year ended January 31, 2016.\nYear Ended January 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2014. Amortization of other acquired intangible assets increased approximately $20.5 million, or 83%, from $24.7 million in the year ended January 31, 2014 to $45.2 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 primarily due to amortization associated with business combinations that closed during the year ended January 31, 2015.\nFurther discussion regarding our business combinations appears in Note 4, \"Business Combinations\" to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this report.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nThe following table sets forth total other expense, net for the years ended January 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014:\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 - 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 - 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,490\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>963\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(33,885\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(36,661\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29,780\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Losses on early retirements of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,546\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,879\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency (losses) gains\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,037\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13,402\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,057\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(40)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gains on derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,986\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(90)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Derecognition of indemnification asset related to CTI Merger\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,874\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,634\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(155\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,689\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(91)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other income (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,277\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,571\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20,275\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(53)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(44,672\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(57,708\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(58,971\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Percentage is not meaningful.\nYear Ended January 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2015.

Of this amount, $7.1 million was recorded in connection with the extinguishment of the March 2013 Term Loans (defined below), and $5.5 million was recorded in connection with the retirement of $530.0 million of the February 2014 Term Loans and March 2014 Term Loans (defined below). Further discussion regarding our credit facilities appears in Note 6, Long-Term Debt\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this report.\nInterest expense decreased to $33.9 million in the year ended January 31, 2016 from $36.7 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 primarily due to lower interest rates on outstanding borrowings during the year ended January 31, 2016.\nWe recorded $8.0 million of net foreign currency losses in the year ended January 31, 2016 compared to $13.4 million of net losses in the year ended January 31, 2015. Foreign currency losses in the year ended January 31, 2016 resulted primarily from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Singapore dollar, euro, and Canadian dollar resulting in foreign currency losses on our Singapore dollar, euro, and Canadian dollar-denominated net assets, respectively, in certain entities which use a U.S. dollar functional currency. Also contributing to the net foreign currency loss was the strengthening of the U.S dollar against the British pound sterling, resulting in foreign currency losses on U.S dollar-denominated net liabilities in certain entities which use a British pound sterling functional currency, and the strengthening of the U.S dollar against the Brazilian real, resulting in foreign currency losses on U.S dollar denominated net liabilities in certain entities which use a Brazilian real functional currency.\nIn the year ended January 31, 2016, there were net gains on derivative financial instruments (not designated as hedging instruments) of $0.4 million, compared to net gains of $4.0 million on such instruments for the year ended January 31, 2015. The net gains in the current year reflected gains on contracts executed to hedge movements in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro.\nOther, net, expense increased to $4.6 million in the year ended January 31, 2016 from $0.2 million in the year ended January 31, 2015. Other, net, expense in the year ended January 31, 2016 consisted primarily of write-offs of indemnification assets associated with tax liabilities recorded in connection with prior business combinations.\nYear Ended January 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2014. Total other expense, net, decreased by $1.3 million from $59.0 million in the year ended January 31, 2014 to $57.7 million in the year ended January 31, 2015.\nDuring the year ended January 31, 2015, we recorded $12.5 million of losses upon early retirements of debt. Of this amount, $7.1 million was recorded in connection with the early retirement of the March 2013 Term Loans (defined below), and $5.5 million was recorded in connection with the early retirement of $530.0 million of the February 2014 Term Loans and March 2014 Term Loans (defined below). Further discussion regarding our credit facilities appears in Note 6, Long-Term Debt\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this report.\nInterest expense increased to $36.7 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 from $29.8 million in the year ended January 31, 2014 primarily due to incremental borrowings discussed in Note 6, Long-Term Debt\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this report.\nWe recorded $13.4 million of net foreign currency losses in the year ended January 31, 2015 compared to $6.1 million of net losses in the year ended January 31, 2014. Foreign currency losses in the year ended January 31, 2015 resulted primarily from (i) strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound sterling, resulting in foreign currency losses on U.S. dollar-denominated net liabilities in certain entities which use a British pound sterling functional currency, (ii) weakening of the euro against the British pound sterling, resulting in foreign currency losses on euro-denominated net assets in certain entities which use a British pound sterling functional currency, and (iii) strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Singapore dollar, resulting in foreign currency losses on Singapore dollar-denominated net assets in certain entities which use a U.S. dollar functional currency. Of the $13.4 million of net foreign currency losses in the year ended January 31, 2015, $12.4 million were recorded during the three months ended January 31, 2015.\nIn the year ended January 31, 2015, there were net gains on derivative financial instruments (not designated as hedging instruments) of $4.0 million, compared to net gains of $0.3 million on such instruments for the year ended January 31, 2014. The higher net gains in the current year reflected gains on contracts executed to hedge movements in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro.\nOther, net, expense decreased to $0.2 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 from $1.7 million in the year ended January 31, 2014 due to the inclusion of a $1.1 million write-off of an indemnification asset associated with tax liabilities recorded in connection with the CTI Merger in the year ended January 31, 2014, with no comparable expense in the year ended January 31, 2015.\nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes\nThe following table sets forth our provision (benefit) for income taxes for the years ended January 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014:\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 - 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 - 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision (benefit) for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>952\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(14,999\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,539\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Percentage is not meaningful.\nYear Ended January 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2015. Our effective income tax rate was 4.1% for the year ended January 31, 2016, compared to an effective income tax benefit rate of 70.1% for the year ended January 31, 2015. For the year ended January 31, 2016, our effective income tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 35% primarily due to mix and levels of income and losses among taxing jurisdictions and changes in unrecognized income tax benefits. We recorded tax benefits of $20.2 million as a result of audit settlements and statute of limitation lapses related to domestic and foreign jurisdictions. Pre-tax income in our profitable jurisdictions, where we recorded income tax provisions at rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate, was substantially offset by our domestic losses where we maintain valuation allowances and did not record the related income tax benefits. The result was an income tax provision of $1.0 million on $23.2 million of pre-tax income, which represented an effective income tax rate of 4.1%. For the year ended January 31, 2015, our effective income tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 35% primarily due to the release of $44.4 million of Verint valuation allowances. We maintain valuation allowances on our net U.S. deferred income tax assets related to federal and certain state jurisdictions. In connection with the acquisition of KANA on February 3, 2014, we recorded deferred income tax liabilities primarily attributable to acquired intangible assets to the extent the amortization will not be deductible for income tax purposes. Under accounting guidelines, because the amortization of the intangible assets in future periods provides a source of taxable income, we expect to realize a portion of our existing deferred income tax assets. As such, we reduced the valuation allowance recorded on our deferred income tax assets to the extent of the deferred income tax liabilities recorded. Because the valuation allowance related to existing Verint deferred income tax assets, the impact of the release was reflected as a discrete income tax benefit and not as a component of the KANA acquisition accounting. The effective income tax rate was also affected by the mix and levels of income and losses among taxing jurisdictions, changes in unrecognized income tax benefits, and the recording of valuation allowance on certain income tax attributes of a foreign subsidiary where we do not expect to realize the benefits. Pre-tax income in our profitable jurisdictions, where we recorded income tax provisions at rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate, was substantially offset by our domestic losses where we maintain valuation allowances and did not record the related income tax benefits. The result was an income tax benefit of $15.0 million on $21.4 million of pre-tax income, which represented an effective income tax benefit rate of 70.1%.\nYear Ended January 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2014. Our effective income tax benefit rate was 70.1% for the year ended January 31, 2015, compared to 7.2% for the year ended January 31, 2014. For the year ended January 31, 2015, our effective income tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 35% primarily due to the release of $44.4 million of Verint valuation allowances. As discussed in the prior paragraph, this resulted in an income tax benefit of $15.0 million on $21.4 million of pre-tax income, resulting in an income tax benefit rate of 70.1%. For the year ended January 31, 2014, our effective income tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 35% primarily due to the level and mix of income and losses by jurisdiction and an income tax benefit of $12.4 million for the reversal of unrecognized tax benefits established in connection with the CTI Merger. The recognition of the CTI income tax benefits resulted in a charge within other income (expense), net due to the write-off of an indemnification asset. Pre-tax income in our profitable jurisdictions, where we recorded income tax provisions at rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate, was partially offset by our domestic losses where we maintain valuation allowances and did not record the related income tax benefits. The result was an income tax provision of $4.5 million on $63.3 million of pre-tax income, which represented an effective income tax rate of 7.2%.\nThe comparison of our effective income tax rates between periods is significantly impacted by the level and mix of earnings and losses by tax jurisdiction, foreign income tax rate differentials, amount of permanent book to tax differences, the impact of unrecognized tax benefits, and the effects of valuation allowances on certain loss jurisdictions.\nBacklog\nWhile we have certain projects with multiple deliverables over longer periods of time, for most of our transactions, delivery generally occurs within several months following receipt of the order. As a result, we believe that our backlog at any particular time is not meaningful because it is not necessarily indicative of future revenue.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur primary recurring source of cash is the collection of proceeds from the sale of products and services to our customers, including cash periodically collected in advance of delivery or performance.\nOur primary recurring use of cash is payment of our operating costs, which consist primarily of employee-related expenses, such as compensation and benefits, as well as general operating expenses for marketing, facilities and overhead costs, and capital expenditures. We also utilize cash for debt service under our Credit Agreement and our Notes, and periodically for business acquisitions. Cash generated from operations, along with our existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, are our primary sources of operating liquidity, and we believe that our operating liquidity is sufficient to support our current business operations, including debt service and capital expenditure requirements.\nWe have historically expanded our business in part by investing in strategic growth initiatives, including acquisitions of products, technologies, and businesses. We have used cash as consideration for substantially all of our historical business acquisitions, including approximately $31 million of net cash expended for business acquisitions during the year ended January 31, 2016.\nWe continually examine our options with respect to terms and sources of existing and future short-term and long-term capital resources to enhance our operating results and to ensure that we retain financial flexibility, and may from time to time elect to raise additional equity or debt capital in the capital markets.\nA considerable portion of our operating income is earned outside the United States. Cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash and bank time deposits (including any long-term portions) held by our subsidiaries outside of the United States were $321.5 million and $297.2 million as of January 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and are generally used to fund the subsidiaries' operating requirements and to invest in growth initiatives, including business acquisitions. We currently do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations for the next 12 months or for the foreseeable future.\nShould other circumstances arise whereby we require more capital in the United States than is generated by our domestic operations, or should we otherwise consider it in our best interests, we could repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions, which could result in higher effective tax rates. If available, our NOLs, particularly those in the United States, could reduce potential income tax liabilities that may result from repatriated earnings from foreign jurisdictions to the United\nStates. We generally have not provided for deferred income taxes on the excess of the amount for financial reporting over the tax basis of investments in our foreign subsidiaries because we currently plan to indefinitely reinvest such earnings outside the United States.\nThe following table sets forth our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and bank time deposits, short-term investments and long-term debt as of January 31, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>352,105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>285,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restricted cash and bank time deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,920\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55,982\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and bank time deposits, and short-term investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>419,907\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>357,743\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total debt, including current maturities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>738,087\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>726,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur operating activities generated $156.9 million of cash during the year ended January 31, 2016, which was partially offset by $85.8 million of net cash used in combined investing and financing activities during this period. Further discussion of these items appears below.\nConsolidated Cash Flow Activity\nThe following table summarizes selected items from our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended January 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended January 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>156,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>193,725\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>178,284\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(75,600\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(676,835\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(64,196\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,204\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>395,713\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,066\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,149\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67,033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(93,546\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>168,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities is driven primarily by our net income (which decreased $14.2 million in the year ended January 31, 2016 compared to the year ended January 31, 2015), adjusted for non-cash items, and working capital changes. Operating activities generated $156.9 million of net cash during the year ended January 31, 2016, compared to $193.7 million generated during the year ended January 31, 2015.\nOperating activities generated $193.7 million of net cash during the year ended January 31, 2015, compared to $178.3 million generated during the year ended January 31, 2014. Our operating results for the year ended January 31, 2015 included $122.1 million of net non-cash expenses, compared to $97.3 million of net non-cash expenses in the prior year, so despite reporting lower net income in the year ended January 31, 2015 compared to the prior year, our operating cash flow improved.\nOur cash flow from operating activities can fluctuate from period to period due to several factors, including the timing of our billings and collections, the timing and amounts of interest, income tax and other payments, and our operating results.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nDuring the year ended January 31, 2016, our investing activities used $75.6 million of net cash, the primary components of which were $31.4 million of net cash utilized for business acquisitions, $30.3 million of payments for property, equipment, and capitalized software development costs, and $21.4 million of net purchases of short-term investments during the year.\nPartially offsetting those uses was $7.5 million of net cash provided by other investing activities, consisting primarily of decreases in restricted cash and bank time deposits during the period. Restricted cash and bank time deposits are typically short-term deposits used to secure bank guarantees in connection with customer sales contracts, the amounts of which will fluctuate from period to period.\nDuring the year ended January 31, 2015, our investing activities used $676.8 million of net cash, the primary component of which was $605.3 million of net cash utilized for business acquisitions, including the acquisitions of KANA in February 2014 and UTX in March 2014. We also had a $36.3 million increase in restricted cash and bank time deposits during this period. The increase in restricted cash and bank time deposits during the year reflected deposits associated with several large sales contracts. In addition, during the year we made $29.2 million of payments for property, equipment, and capitalized software development costs, and made $7.5 million of net purchases of short-term investments.\nDuring the year ended January 31, 2014, our investing activities used $64.2 million of net cash, the primary components of which were $32.8 million of net cash utilized for business acquisitions, $22.4 million of payments for property, equipment, and capitalized software development costs, and $18.9 million of net purchases of short-term investments. Partially offsetting these uses was a $7.7 million decrease in restricted cash and bank time deposits.\nWe had no significant commitments for capital expenditures at January 31, 2016.\nNet Cash (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities\nFor the year ended January 31, 2016, our financing activities used $10.2 million of net cash, including payments of $7.2 million for the financing portion of payments under contingent consideration arrangements related to prior business combinations, and dividend payments of $3.2 million to the noncontrolling interest holders in a joint venture which serves as a systems integrator for certain Asian markets.\nFor the year ended January 31, 2015, our financing activities provided $395.7 million of net cash. In connection with the February 2014 acquisition of KANA, we incurred $300.0 million of incremental term loans and borrowed $125.0 million under the revolving credit facility under our Credit Agreement (defined below). Additionally, in March 2014, we incurred $643.5 million of new term loans, the proceeds of which were used to repay $643.5 million of prior term loans. In June 2014, we completed concurrent public offerings of 5,750,000 shares of our common stock, gross proceeds from which were $274.6 million, and $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.50% convertible senior notes. We used $15.6 million of the net proceeds from these offerings to pay the net costs of an arrangement consisting of the purchase of call options and the sale of warrants to purchase our common stock, the intent of which is to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon conversion of the Notes. We used the majority of the remainder of the net proceeds to retire $530.0 million of the February 2014 Term Loans and March 2014 Term Loans, and all $106.0 million of then-outstanding borrowings under the rvolving credit facility under our Credit Agreement. In connection with these various financing activities, we paid $29.2 million of debt and equity issuance costs, including underwriting discounts and commissions associated with the public offerings. Other financing activities during the year ended January 31, 2015 included payments of $10.4 million for the financing portion of payments under contingent consideration arrangements related to prior business combinations, and the receipt of $17.6 million of proceeds from exercises of stock options.\nFor the year ended January 31, 2014, our financing activities provided $54.5 million of net cash. During this period, we borrowed $646.7 million under our Credit Agreement, repaid $576.0 million of outstanding borrowings under our prior Credit Agreement, and paid $7.8 million of related debt issuance costs. We also received $10.4 million of cash in connection with the CTI Merger during this year. Other financing activities during the year ended January 31, 2014 included payments of $16.1 million for the financing portion of payments under contingent consideration arrangements related to prior business combinations, and the receipt of $10.9 million of proceeds from exercises of stock options.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources Requirements\nBased on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated operating costs, required payments of principal and interest, working capital needs, ordinary course capital expenditures, research and development spending, and other commitments for at least the next 12 months. Currently, we have no plans to pay any cash dividends on our common stock, which are not permitted under our Credit Agreement.\nOur liquidity could be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand for our products and service and support, including the impact of changes in customer buying behavior due to circumstances over which we have no control. If we determine to make additional business acquisitions or otherwise require additional funds, we may need to raise additional capital, which could involve the issuance of additional equity or debt securities.\nOn March 29, 2016, we announced that our board of directors had authorized a new share repurchase program whereby we may make up to $150 million in purchases of our outstanding shares of common stock over the two years following the date of announcement. Under the share repurchase program, purchases can be made from time to time using a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases. The specific timing, price and size of purchases will depend on prevailing stock prices, general market and economic conditions, and other considerations, including the amount of cash generated in the U.S. and other potential uses of cash, such as acquisitions. Purchases may be made through a Rule 10b5-1 plan pursuant to pre-determined metrics set forth in such plan. The board of directors' authorization of the share repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.\nFinancing Arrangements\n1.50% Convertible Senior Notes\nOn June 18, 2014, we issued $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.50% convertible senior notes due June 1, 2021, unless earlier converted by the holders pursuant to their terms. The Notes pay interest in cash semiannually in arrears at a rate of 1.50% per annum.\nThe Notes were issued concurrently with our issuance of 5,750,000 shares of common stock, the majority of the combined net proceeds of which were used to partially repay certain indebtedness under our Credit Agreement, as further described below.\nThe Notes are unsecured and rank senior in right of payment to our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes; equal in right of payment to our indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively subordinated in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally subordinated to indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries.\nThe Notes are convertible into, at our election, cash, shares of common stock, or a combination of both, subject to satisfaction of specified conditions and during specified periods, as described below. If converted, we currently intend to pay cash in respect of the principal amount.\nThe conversion price of the Notes at any time is equal to $1,000 divided by the then-applicable conversion rate. The Notes have an initial conversion rate of 15.5129 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which represents an initial effective conversion price of approximately $64.46 per share of common stock and would result in the issuance of approximately 6,205,000 shares if all of the Notes were converted. Throughout the term of the Notes, the conversion rate may be adjusted upon the occurrence of certain events.\nHolders may surrender their Notes for conversion at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding December 1, 2020, only under the following circumstances:\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on September 30, 2014, if the closing sale price of our common stock, for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) in the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is more than 130% of the conversion price of the Notes in effect on each applicable trading day;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>during the ten consecutive trading-day period following any five consecutive trading-day period in which the trading price for the Notes for each such trading day was less than 98% of the closing sale price of our common stock on such date multiplied by the then-current conversion rate; or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>upon the occurrence of specified corporate events, as described in the indenture governing the Notes, such as a consolidation, merger, or binding share exchange.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn or after December 1, 2020 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the\nmaturity date, holders may surrender their Notes for conversion regardless of whether any of the foregoing conditions have been satisfied.\nIf we satisfy our conversion obligation in solely cash or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, the amount of cash and shares of common stock, if any, due upon conversion will be based on a daily conversion value for each trading day in a 50 trading-day conversion period. Holders will not receive any additional cash payment or additional shares of common stock representing accrued and unpaid interest, if any, upon conversion of a Note, except in limited circumstances. Instead, interest will be deemed to be paid by the consideration delivered upon conversion of a Note.\nThe conversion rate for the Notes is subject to adjustment as described in the indenture governing the Notes. An adjustment to the conversion rate will result in a corresponding (but inverse) adjustment to the conversion price.\nIf specified make-whole adjustment events\u201d occur, the conversion rate for any Notes converted in connection with such make-whole adjustment event will, in specified circumstances, be increased by a number of additional shares of common stock. In addition, holders may require us to purchase for cash all or any portion of their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change\u201d at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change purchase date.\nAs of January 31, 2016, the Notes were not convertible.\nNote Hedges and Warrants\nConcurrently with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions (the Note Hedges\u201d) and sold warrants (the Warrants\u201d). The combination of the Note Hedges and the Warrants serves to increase the effective initial conversion price for the Notes to $75.00 per share. The Note Hedges and Warrants are each separate instruments from the Notes.\nNote Hedges\nPursuant to the Note Hedges, we purchased call options on our common stock, under which we have the right to acquire from the counterparties up to approximately 6,205,000 shares of our common stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, at a price of $64.46, which equals the initial conversion price of the Notes. Our exercise rights under the Note Hedges generally trigger upon conversion of the Notes and the Note Hedges terminate upon maturity of the Notes, or the first day the Notes are no longer outstanding. The Note Hedges may be settled in cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination thereof, at our option, and are intended to reduce our exposure to potential dilution upon conversion of the Notes. We paid $60.8 million for the Note Hedges, which was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital. As of January 31, 2016, we had not purchased any shares under the Note Hedges.\nWarrants\nWe sold the Warrants to several counterparties. The Warrants provide the counterparties rights to acquire from us up to approximately 6,205,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $75.00 per share. The Warrants expire incrementally on a series of expiration dates beginning in August 2021. At expiration, if the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the Warrants, we will be obligated to issue shares of our common stock having a value equal to such excess. The proceeds from the sale of the Warrants were $45.2 million and were recorded as additional paid-in capital. As of January 31, 2016, no Warrants had been exercised and all Warrants remained outstanding.\nCredit Agreement\nIn April 2011, we entered into a credit agreement with our lenders, which was amended and restated on March 6, 2013, and further amended on February 3, 2014, March 7, 2014, and June 18, 2014 (the \"Credit Agreement\"). The Credit Agreement, as amended and restated, provides for senior secured credit facilities, comprised of $943.5 million of term loans, of which $300.0 million was borrowed in February 2014 (the \"February 2014 Term Loans\") and of which $643.5 million was borrowed in March 2014 (the \"March 2014 Term Loans\"), all of which mature in September 2019, and a $300.0 million revolving credit facility maturing in September 2018, subject to increase and reduction from time to time, as described in the Credit Agreement.\nOn June 18, 2014, we utilized the majority of the combined net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes and the concurrent\nissuance of 5,750,000 shares of common stock to retire $530.0 million of the February 2014 Term Loans and March 2014 Term\nLoans. At January 31, 2016 and 2015, $411.1 million of combined borrowings were outstanding under the February 2014 Term Loans and March 2014 Term Loans, currently bearing interest at an annual rate of 3.50%, and there were no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\nOn February 11, 2016, we executed a pay-fixed, receive-variable interest rate swap with a multinational financial institution to partially mitigate risks associated with the variable interest rate on our term loans under which we will pay interest at a fixed rate of 4.143% and receive variable interest of three-month LIBOR (subject to a minimum of 0.75%), plus a spread of 2.75%, on a notional amount of $200.0 million. The effective date of the agreement is November 1, 2016, and settlements with the counterparty will occur on a quarterly basis, beginning on February 1, 2017. The agreement will terminate on September 6,\n2019. Assuming that we elect three-month LIBOR at the term loans' interest rate reset dates, beginning on November 1, 2016 and throughout the term of the interest rate swap agreement, the annual interest rate on $200.0 million of our term loans will be fixed at 4.143% during that period.\nFollowing the partial retirements of the February 2014 Term Loans and March 2014 Term Loans in June 2014 described above, there are no scheduled principal payments on the term loans until August 2016. The vast majority of the term loan balances are due upon maturity in September 2019.\nThe revolving credit facility contains a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (each as defined in the Credit Agreement) of no greater than 5.00 to 1 until January 31, 2016 and no greater than 4.50 to 1 thereafter (the \"Leverage Ratio Covenant\"). At January 31, 2016, our consolidated leverage ratio was approximately 2.5 to 1 compared to a permitted consolidated leverage ratio of 5.00 to 1, and our EBITDA for the twelve-month period then ended exceeded by at least $120.0 million the minimum EBITDA required to satisfy the Leverage Ratio Covenant given our outstanding debt as of such date.\nContractual Obligations\nAt January 31, 2016, our contractual obligations were as follows:\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>< 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>> 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt obligations, including interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>899,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>424,622\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>403,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>139,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,846\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63,959\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,776\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long-term obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>676\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>248\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>240\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,085,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69,728\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>96,974\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>451,562\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>467,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe long-term debt obligations reflected above include projected interest payments over the term of our outstanding debt as of January 31, 2016, assuming interest rates in effect for our term loan borrowings as of January 31, 2016.\nOperating lease obligations reflected above exclude future sublease income from certain space we have subleased to third parties. As of January 31, 2016, total expected future sublease income was $1.0 million and will range from $0.1 million to $0.8 million on an annual basis through August 2018.\nDuring the year ended January 31, 2016, we entered into a new operating lease for a facility in Herzliya, Israel, whose lease term commenced on February 1, 2016. The aggregate minimum lease commitment over the 12-year term of this new lease, excluding operating expenses, is approximately $40.6 million. This operating lease commitment is reflected in the table above.\nOur purchase obligations are associated with agreements for purchases of goods or services generally including agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transactions. Agreements to purchase goods or services that have cancellation provisions with no penalties are excluded from these purchase obligations.\nOur consolidated balance sheet at January 31, 2016 included $25.3 million of non-current tax reserves, net of related benefits (including interest and penalties of $3.3 million) for uncertain tax positions. However, these amounts are not included in the table above because it is not possible to predict or estimate the timing of payments for these obligations. We do not expect to make any significant payments for these uncertain tax positions within the next 12 months.\nContingent Payments Associated with Business Combinations\nIn connection with certain of our business combinations, we have agreed to make contingent cash payments to the former owners of the acquired companies based upon achievement of performance targets following the acquisition dates.\nFor the year ended January 31, 2016, we made $7.4 million of payments under contingent consideration arrangements. As of January 31, 2016, potential future cash payments and earned consideration expected to be paid subsequent to January 31, 2016 under contingent consideration arrangements total $51.7 million, the estimated fair value of which was $22.4 million, including $4.0 million reported in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and $18.4 million reported in other liabilities. The performance periods associated with these potential payments extend through April 2020.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of January 31, 2016, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that we believe have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted\nIn April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, and in August 2015 issued ASU No. 2015-15, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements. ASU No. 2015-03 changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements by requiring an entity to present such costs on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. ASU No. 2015-15 provides clarification regarding costs to secure revolving lines of credit, and indicates that the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements as an asset and subsequently amortizing them ratably over the term of the revolving debt arrangement. We elected to early adopt ASU No. 2015-03 as of January 31, 2016, and retrospectively reclassified $10.5 million of debt issuance costs associated with our long-term debt as of January 31, 2015 from other non-current assets to long-term debt. $3.1 million of net deferred debt issuance costs related to our revolving credit facility continue to be reported within other assets on our consolidated balance sheet at January 31, 2016.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes. The amendments in this update require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as long-term on the balance sheet. We have elected to early adopt ASU 2015-17 as of January 31, 2016 on a prospective basis. The January 31, 2015 consolidated balance sheet was not adjusted.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which will require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. Consistent with current GAAP, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease. However, unlike current GAAP, which requires only capital leases to be recognized on the balance sheet, the new guidance will require both types of leases to be recognized on the balance sheet. The new guidance is effective for all periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and we are currently evaluating the effects that the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements, but anticipate that the new guidance will significantly impact our consolidated financial statements given our significant number of leases.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASU No. 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific revenue recognition guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Accounting Standards Codification. Additionally, this update supersedes some cost guidance included in Subtopic 605-35, Revenue Recognition-Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. As originally issued, this guidance was effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption was not permitted. In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date by one year, to interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, but not before the original effective date of December 15, 2016. Entities may choose from two adoption methods, with certain practical expedients. We are currently reviewing this standard to assess the impact on our future consolidated financial statements and evaluating the available adoption methods.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with \"Business\" under Item 1, \"Selected Financial Data\" under Item 6, and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included under Item 8 of this report. This discussion contains a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on our current expectations and all of which could be affected by uncertainties and risks. Our actual results may differ materially from the results contemplated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors including, but not limited to, those described in \"Risk Factors\" under Item 1A of this report.\nOverview\nOur Business\nVerint is a global leader in Actionable Intelligence solutions. Actionable Intelligence is a necessity in a dynamic world of massive information growth because it empowers organizations with crucial insights and enables decision makers to anticipate, respond, and take action. With Verint solutions and value-added services, organizations of all sizes and across many industries can make more timely and effective decisions. Today, more than 10,000 organizations in 180 countries, including over 80 percent of the Fortune 100, use Verint solutions to improve enterprise performance and make the world a safer place. Verint's vision is to create A Smarter World with Actionable Intelligence.\nOur Actionable Intelligence solutions help organizations address three important challenges: Customer Engagement Optimization; Security Intelligence; and Fraud, Risk, and Compliance. We help our customers capture large amounts of information from numerous data types and sources, use analytics to glean insights from the information, and leverage the resulting Actionable Intelligence to help achieve their customer engagement, enhanced security, and risk mitigation goals.\nHeadquartered in Melville, New York, we support our customers around the globe directly and with an extensive network of selling and support partners.\nWe conduct our business through three operating segments-Enterprise Intelligence, Cyber Intelligence, and Video Intelligence. Organizing our business through three operating segments allows us to align our resources and domain expertise to more effectively address the Actionable Intelligence market. We address the Customer Engagement Optimization market opportunity through solutions from our Enterprise Intelligence segment. We address the Security Intelligence market\nopportunity through solutions from our Cyber Intelligence segment and Video Intelligence segment, and we address the Fraud, Risk, and Compliance market opportunity through solutions from all three operating segments.\nFor the years ended January 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, our Enterprise Intelligence segment represented approximately 55%, 58%, and 55% of our total revenue, respectively. For the years ended January 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, our Cyber Intelligence segment represented approximately 34%, 32%, and 32% of our total revenue, respectively. For the years ended January 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, our Video Intelligence segment represented approximately 11%, 10%, and 13% of our total revenue, respectively.\nGenerally, we make business decisions by evaluating the risks and rewards of the opportunities available to us in the markets served by each of our segments. We view each operating segment differently and allocate capital, personnel, resources, and management attention accordingly. In reviewing each operating segment, we also review the performance of that segment by geography. Our marketing and sales strategies, expansion opportunities, and product offerings may differ materially within a particular segment geographically, as may our allocation of resources between segments. When making decisions regarding investment in our business, increasing capital expenditures, or making other decisions that may reduce our profitability, we also consider the leverage ratio in our revolving credit facility. See \"- Liquidity and Capital Resources\" for more information.\nKey Trends and Factors That May Impact our Performance\nWe believe that there are many factors that affect our ability to sustain and increase both revenue and profitability, including:\n \u2022 Market acceptance of Actionable Intelligence solutions. We compete in markets where the value of aspects of our products and solutions is still in the process of market acceptance. Our future growth depends in part on the continued and increasing acceptance and realization of the value of our product offerings. However, we believe that organizations in both the enterprise and security markets want and need Actionable Intelligence solutions to help achieve their customer engagement, enhanced security, and risk mitigation goals. \n \u2022 Evolving technologies and market potential. Our success depends in part on our ability to keep pace with technological changes, customer challenges, and evolving industry standards in our product offerings, successfully developing, launching, and driving demand for new, innovative, high-quality products and services that meet or exceed customer needs, and identifying, entering, and prioritizing areas of growing market potential. For example, in our Security Intelligence business, stronger and more frequent use of encryption has created significantly greater challenges for our customers and for our solutions to address. In the enterprise market, we believe that today's customer-centric organizations are increasingly seeking Customer Engagement Optimization solutions that allow them to collect and analyze intelligence across different service channels to gain a better understanding of the performance of their workforce, the effectiveness of their service processes, the quality of their interactions, and changing customer behaviors, as well as to anticipate and prevent information security breaches, effectively authenticate customers, protect personal information, mitigate risk, prevent fraud, and help ensure compliance with evolving legal, regulatory, and internal requirements. In the security market, we believe that terrorism, criminal activities, cyber-attacks, and other security threats, combined with new and more complex security challenges, including increasingly frequent and sophisticated cyber-attacks and increasingly complex and secure communication networks, are driving demand for Actionable Intelligence solutions to help anticipate, prepare, and respond to these threats. \n \u2022 Information technology and government spending. Our growth and results depend in part on general economic conditions and the pace of information technology spending by both commercial and governmental customers. In the year ended January 31, 2016, we experienced extended sales cycles, particularly for large projects, a reduction in deal sizes, and pressure on maintenance renewals for our Enterprise Intelligence solutions. This trend regarding extended sales cycles and reduced deal sizes was particularly acute for our Security Intelligence business which has significant exposure to emerging markets where budgets have been reduced significantly due to weak economic conditions and currency devaluations. \nSee Item 1 of this report for more information on key trends that we believe are driving demand for our solutions and \"Risk Factors\" under Item 1A of this report for a more complete description of risks that may impact future revenue and profitability.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nAn appreciation of our critical accounting policies is necessary to understand our financial results. The accounting policies outlined below are considered to be critical because they can materially affect our operating results and financial condition, as these policies may require us to make difficult and subjective judgments regarding uncertainties. The accuracy of these estimates and the likelihood of future changes depend on a range of possible outcomes and a number of underlying variables, many of which are beyond our control, and there can be no assurance that our estimates are accurate.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue recognition policy is a critical component of determining our operating results and is based on a complex set of accounting rules that require us to make significant judgments and estimates. We derive and report our revenue in two categories: (a) product revenue, including sale of hardware products (which include software that works together with the hardware to deliver the product's essential functionality) and licensing of software products, and (b) service and support revenue, including revenue from installation services, post-contract customer support (\"PCS\"), project management, hosting services, SaaS, application managed services, product warranties, business advisory consulting and training services. Our customer arrangements may include any combination of these elements. We follow the appropriate revenue recognition rules for each of these revenue streams. For additional information, see Note 1, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this report. Revenue recognition for a particular arrangement is dependent upon such factors as the level of customization within the solution and the contractual delivery, acceptance, payment, and support terms with the customer. Significant judgment is required to conclude on each of these factors, and if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments, it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period.\nWe generally consider a purchase order or executed sales quote, when combined with a master license agreement, to constitute evidence of an arrangement. Delivery occurs when the product is shipped or transmitted and title and risk of loss have transferred to the customers. Our typical customer arrangements do not include substantive product acceptance provisions; however, if such provisions are provided, delivery is deemed to occur upon acceptance. We consider the fee to be fixed or determinable unless the fee is subject to refund or adjustment or is not payable within our standard payment terms. If the fee due from a customer is not fixed or determinable due to extended payment terms, revenue is recognized when payment becomes due or upon cash receipt, whichever is earlier.\nOur multiple-element arrangements consist of a combination of our product and service offerings that may be delivered at various points in time. For arrangements within the scope of the multiple-deliverable guidance, a deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has stand-alone value and there are no customer-negotiated refunds or return rights for the delivered elements. For multiple-element arrangements comprised only of tangible products containing software components and non-software components and related services, we allocate revenue to each element in an arrangement based on a selling price hierarchy. The selling price for a deliverable is based on its vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE\u201d), if available, third-party evidence ( TPE\u201d), if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price ( ESP\u201d), if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. The total transaction revenue is allocated to the multiple elements based on each element's relative selling price compared to the total selling price.\nWe account for multiple-element arrangements that contain only software and software-related elements by allocating a portion of the total purchase price to the undelivered elements, primarily installation services, PCS, consulting, and training, using VSOE of fair value of the undelivered elements. The remaining portion of the total transaction value is allocated to the delivered software, referred to as the residual method. If we are unable to establish VSOE for the undelivered elements of the arrangement, revenue recognition is deferred for the entire arrangement until all elements of the arrangement are delivered. However, if the only undelivered element is PCS, we recognize the arrangement fee ratably over the PCS period.\nFor multiple-element arrangements that are comprised of a combination of hardware and software elements, the total transaction value is bifurcated between the hardware elements and the software elements that are not essential to the functionality of the hardware, based on the relative selling prices of the hardware elements and the software elements as a group. Revenue is then recognized for the hardware and hardware-related services following the hardware revenue recognition methodology outlined above and revenue for the software and software-related services is recognized following the residual method or ratably over the PCS period if VSOE for PCS does not exist.\nOur policy for establishing VSOE for installation, business advisory consulting, and training is based upon an analysis of separate sales of services. We utilize either the substantive renewal rate approach or the bell-shaped curve approach to establish VSOE for our PCS offerings, depending upon the business segment, geographical region, or product line. The timing of revenue recognition on software licenses and other revenue could be significantly impacted if we are unable to maintain VSOE on one or more undelivered elements during any quarterly period. Loss of VSOE could result in (i) the complete deferral of all\nrevenue or (ii) ratable recognition of all revenue under a customer arrangement until such time as VSOE is re-established. If we are unable to re-establish VSOE on one or more undelivered elements for an extended period of time it would impact our ability to accurately forecast the timing of quarterly revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe typically are not able to determine TPE for our products or our service and support offerings. TPE of selling price is established by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in stand-alone sales to similarly situated customers.\nIf we are unable to determine the selling price because VSOE or TPE does not exist, we determine ESP for the purposes of allocating the arrangement by considering several external and internal factors including, but not limited to, pricing practices, similar product offerings, margin objectives, geographies in which we offer our products and services, internal costs, competition, and product lifecycle. The determination of ESP is made through consultation with and approval by our management, taking into consideration our go-to-market strategies. We have established processes to update ESP for each element, when appropriate, to ensure that it reflects recent pricing experience.\nPCS revenue is derived from providing technical software support services and unspecified software updates and upgrades to customers on a when-and-if-available basis. PCS revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance period which, in most cases, is one year. When PCS is included within a multiple-element arrangement, we utilize either the substantive renewal rate approach or the bell-shaped curve approach to establish VSOE of the PCS, depending upon the business operating segment, geographical region, or product line.\nUnder the substantive renewal rate approach, we believe it is necessary to evaluate whether both the support renewal rate and term are substantive, and whether the renewal rate is being consistently applied to subsequent renewals for a particular customer. We establish VSOE under this approach through analyzing the renewal rate stated in the customer agreement and determining whether that rate is above the minimum substantive VSOE renewal rate established for that particular PCS offering. The minimum substantive VSOE rate is determined based upon an analysis of renewal rates associated with historical PCS contracts. Typically, renewal rates of 15% for PCS plans that provide when-and-if-available upgrades, and 10% for plans that do not provide for when-and-if-available upgrades, would be deemed to be minimum substantive renewal rates. For contracts that do not contain a stated renewal rate, revenue associated with the entire bundled arrangement is recognized ratably over the PCS term. Contracts that have a renewal rate below the minimum substantive VSOE rate are deemed to contain a more than insignificant discount element, for which VSOE cannot be established. We recognize revenue for these arrangements over the period that the customer is entitled to renew their PCS at the discounted rate, but not to exceed the estimated economic life of the product.\nUnder the bell-shaped curve approach of establishing VSOE, we perform a VSOE compliance test to ensure that a substantial majority (75% or over) of our actual PCS renewals are within a narrow range of plus or minus 15% of the median pricing.\nSome of our arrangements require significant customization of the product to meet the particular requirements of the customer. For these arrangements, revenue is recognized under contract accounting methods, typically using the percentage of completion (\"POC\") method. Under the POC method, revenue recognition is generally based upon the ratio of hours incurred to date to the total estimated hours required to complete the contract. Profit estimates on long-term contracts are revised periodically based on changes in circumstances, and any losses on contracts are recognized in the period that such losses become evident. Generally, the terms of long-term contracts provide for progress billings based on completion of milestones or other defined phases of work. Significant judgment is often required when estimating total hours and progress to completion on these arrangements, as well as whether a loss is expected to be incurred on the contract due to several factors including the degree of customization required and the customer's existing environment. We use historical experience, project plans, and an assessment of the risks and uncertainties inherent in the arrangement to establish these estimates. Uncertainties in these arrangements include implementation delays or performance issues that may or may not be within our control.\nOur SaaS offerings generally provide customers access to certain of our software within a cloud-based information technology environment that we manage and offer to customers on a subscription basis. We recognize revenue for subscription and related support services over the contract period originating when the subscription service is made available to the customer and the contractual hosting period has commenced.\nOur application managed services revenue is derived from providing services that enhance our customers IT processes and maximize the business benefits of our solutions. Application managed services revenue is recognized ratably over the applicable term which, in most cases, is at least one year. When application managed services is included within a multiple-\nelement arrangement, we utilize the substantive renewal rate approach to establish VSOE. In addition, we perform a budget versus actual time analysis to support our initial estimate of effort required to provide these services.\nWe extend customary trade payment terms to our customers in the normal course of conducting business. To assess the probability of collection for purposes of revenue recognition, we have established credit policies that establish prudent credit limits for our customers. These credit limits are based upon our risk assessment of the customer's ability to pay, their payment history, geographic risk, and other factors, and are not contingent upon the resale of the product or upon the collection of payments from their customers. These credit limits are reviewed and revised periodically on the basis of updated customer financial statement information, payment performance, and other factors. When a customer is not deemed creditworthy, revenue is recognized when payment is received.\nWe record provisions for estimated product returns in the same period in which the associated revenue is recognized. We base these estimates of product returns upon historical levels of sales returns and other known factors. Actual product returns could be different from our estimates and current or future provisions for product returns may differ from historical provisions. Concessions granted to customers are recorded as reductions to revenue in the period in which they were granted and have been minimal in both amount and frequency.\nProduct revenue derived from shipments to resellers and OEMs who purchase our products for resale are generally recognized when such products are shipped (on a \"sell-in\" basis) since we do not expect our resellers or OEMs to carry inventory of our products. This policy is predicated on our ability to estimate sales returns as well as other criteria regarding these customers. We are also required to evaluate whether our resellers and OEMs have the ability to honor their commitment to make fixed or determinable payments regardless of whether they collect payment from their customers. In this regard, we assess whether our resellers and OEMs are new, poorly capitalized, or experiencing financial difficulty, and whether they have a pattern of not paying as amounts become due on previous arrangements or seeking payment terms longer than those provided to end customers. If we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments, it could cause a material change to the revenue reported in a particular period. We have historically experienced insignificant product returns from resellers and OEMs, and our payment terms for these customers are similar to those granted to our end-users. Our policy also presumes that we have no significant performance obligations in connection with the sale of our products by our resellers and OEMs to their customers. If a reseller or OEM develops a pattern of payment delinquency, or seeks payment terms longer than generally granted to our resellers or OEMs, we defer the recognition of revenue from transactions with that reseller or OEM until the receipt of cash.\nMultiple contracts with a single counterparty executed within close proximity of each other are evaluated to determine if the contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single arrangement. We record reimbursements from customers for out-of-pocket expenses as revenue. Shipping and handling fees and expenses that are billed to customers are recognized in revenue and the costs associated with such fees and expenses are recorded in cost of revenue. Historically, these fees and expenses have not been material. Taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities are excluded from revenue.\nFor multiple-element arrangements that contain software and software related elements for which we are unable to establish VSOE of one or more elements, we use various available indicators of fair value and apply our best judgment to reasonably classify the arrangement's revenue into product revenue and service revenue for financial reporting purposes.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe estimate the collectability of our accounts receivable balances each accounting period and adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts accordingly. We exercise a considerable amount of judgment in assessing the collectability of accounts receivable, including consideration of the creditworthiness of each customer, their collection history, and the related aging of past due accounts receivable balances. We evaluate specific accounts when we learn that a customer may be experiencing a deterioration of its financial condition due to lower credit ratings, bankruptcy, or other factors that may affect its ability to render payment.\nAccounting for Business Combinations\nWe allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired, including in-process research and development assets, and liabilities assumed, based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. These fair values are typically estimated with assistance from independent valuation specialists. The purchase price allocation process requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets, contractual support obligations assumed, and pre-acquisition contingencies.\nAlthough we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain.\nExamples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to:\n \u2022 future expected cash flows from software license sales, support agreements, consulting contracts, other customer contracts, and acquired developed technologies; \n \u2022 expected costs to develop in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed; \n \u2022 the acquired company's brand and competitive position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company's product portfolio; \n \u2022 cost of capital and discount rates; and \n \u2022 estimating the useful lives of acquired assets as well as the pattern or manner in which the assets will amortize. \nIn connection with the purchase price allocations for applicable acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of the contractual support obligations we are assuming from the acquired business. The estimated fair value of the support obligations is determined utilizing a cost build-up approach, which determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a reasonable profit margin. The estimated costs to fulfill the support obligations are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the support services. The sum of these costs and operating profit represents an approximation of the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the support obligations.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nWe test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which can be an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, on an annual basis as of November 1, or more frequently if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that impairment in the value of goodwill may exist. As of January 31, 2016, our reporting units are consistent with our operating segments identified in Note 17, \"Segment, Geographic, and Significant Customer Information\" to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this report.\nWe review goodwill for impairment utilizing either a qualitative assessment or a two-step process. If we decide that it is appropriate to perform a qualitative assessment and conclude that the fair value of a reporting unit more likely than not exceeds its carrying value, no further evaluation is necessary. For reporting units where we perform the two-step process, the first step requires us to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit and compare that fair value to the respective carrying value, which includes goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill is not considered impaired and no further evaluation is necessary. If the carrying value is higher than the estimated fair value, there is an indication that impairment may exist and the second step is required. In the second step, the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated as the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the fair values assigned to its assets and liabilities. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill, the difference is recognized as an impairment charge.\nFor reporting units where we decide to perform a qualitative assessment, we assess and make judgments regarding a variety of factors which potentially impact the fair value of a reporting unit, including general economic conditions, industry and market-specific conditions, customer behavior, cost factors, our financial performance and trends, our strategies and business plans, capital requirements, management and personnel issues, and our stock price, among others. We then consider the totality of these and other factors, placing more weight on the events and circumstances that are judged to most affect a reporting unit's fair value or the carrying amount of its net assets, to reach a qualitative conclusion regarding whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount.\nFor reporting units where we perform the two-step process, we utilize some or all of three primary approaches to assess fair value: (a) an income-based approach, using projected discounted cash flows, (b) a market-based approach, using multiples of comparable companies, and (c) a transaction-based approach, using multiples for recent acquisitions of similar businesses made in the marketplace.\nOur estimate of fair value of each reporting unit is based on a number of subjective factors, including: (a) appropriate consideration of valuation approaches (income approach, comparable public company approach, and comparable transaction approach), (b) estimates of future growth rates, (c) estimates of our future cost structure, (d) discount rates for our estimated\ncash flows, (e) selection of peer group companies for the comparable public company and the comparable transaction approaches, (f) required levels of working capital, (g) assumed terminal value, and (h) time horizon of cash flow forecasts.\nThe determination of reporting units also requires judgment. We assess whether a reporting unit exists within a reportable segment by identifying the unit, determining whether the unit qualifies as a business under GAAP, and assessing the availability and regular review by segment management of discrete financial information for the unit.\nWe review intangible assets that have finite useful lives and other long-lived assets when an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment. If any indicators are present, we perform a recoverability test by comparing the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets in question to their carrying amounts. If the undiscounted cash flows used in the test for recoverability are less than the long-lived assets carrying amount, we determine the fair value of the long-lived asset and recognize an impairment loss if the carrying amount of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. The impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.\nFor all of our goodwill and other intangible asset impairment reviews, the assumptions and estimates used in the process are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts. Although we believe the assumptions, judgments, and estimates we have used in our assessments are reasonable and appropriate, a material change in any of our assumptions or external factors could lead to future goodwill or other intangible asset impairment charges.\nBased upon our November 1, 2015 goodwill impairment reviews, we concluded that the estimated fair values of our Enterprise Intelligence, Cyber Intelligence, and Video Intelligence reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying values.\nOur Enterprise Intelligence, Cyber Intelligence, and Video Intelligence reporting units carried goodwill of $1.0 billion, $120.7 million, and $37.5 million, respectively, at January 31, 2016.\nWe did not record any impairments of goodwill for the years ended January 31, 2016, 2015, or 2014.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method which includes the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in our consolidated financial statements. Under this approach, deferred taxes are recorded for the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. The provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus deferred taxes. Deferred taxes result from differences between the financial statement and tax bases of our assets and liabilities, and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. The effects of future changes in income tax laws or rates are not anticipated.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The calculation of our tax provision involves the application of complex tax laws and requires significant judgment and estimates.\nWe evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets for each jurisdiction in which we operate at each reporting date, and we establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income of the same character and in the same jurisdiction. We consider all available positive and negative evidence in making this assessment, including, but not limited to, the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. In circumstances where there is sufficient negative evidence indicating that our deferred tax assets are not more likely than not realizable, we establish a valuation allowance.\nWe use a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by assessing whether they are more likely than not sustainable, based solely on their technical merits, upon examination, and including resolution of any related appeals or litigation process. The second step is to measure the associated tax benefit of each position as the largest amount that we believe is more likely than not realizable. Differences between the amount of tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in our income tax returns and the amount of tax benefits recognized in our financial statements represent our unrecognized income tax benefits, which we either record as a liability or as a reduction of deferred tax assets. Our policy is to include interest (expense and/or income) and penalties related to unrecognized income tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes.\nContingencies\nWe recognize an estimated loss from a claim or loss contingency when and if information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Accounting for claims and contingencies requires the use of significant judgment and estimates. One notable potential source of loss contingencies is pending or threatened litigation. Legal counsel and other advisors and experts are consulted on issues related to litigation as well as on matters related to contingencies occurring in the ordinary course of business.\nAccounting for Stock-Based Compensation\nWe recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award.\nDuring the three-year period ended January 31, 2016, restricted stock units were our predominant stock-based payment award. The fair value of these awards is equivalent to the market value of our common stock on the grant date. In the past, we have also awarded stock options, the fair value of which is estimated on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for this purpose, which requires the input of significant assumptions including an estimate of the average period of time employees will retain stock options before exercising them, the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term, the number of options that will ultimately be forfeited before completing vesting requirements, and the risk-free interest rate.\nWe periodically award restricted stock units that vest upon the achievement of specified performance goals. Our estimate of the fair value of these performance-based awards requires an assessment of the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved. At each reporting date, we update our assessment of the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved and adjust our estimate of the fair value of the award, if necessary.\nChanges in assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock-based compensation and, consequently, the related expense recognized. The assumptions we use in calculating the fair value of stock-based payment awards represent our best estimates, which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\nCost of Revenue\nWe have made an accounting policy election whereby certain costs of product revenue, including hardware and third-party software license fees, are capitalized and amortized over the same period that product revenue is recognized, while installation and other service costs are generally expensed as incurred, except for certain contracts recognized according to contract accounting.\nFor example, in a multiple-element arrangement where revenue is recognized over the PCS support period, the cost of revenue associated with the product is capitalized upon product delivery and amortized over that same period. However, the cost of revenue associated with the services is expensed as incurred in the period in which the services are performed. In addition, we expense customer acquisition and origination costs to selling, general and administrative expense, including sales commissions, as incurred, with the exception of certain sales referral fees in our Cyber Intelligence segment which are capitalized and amortized ratably over the revenue recognition period.\nResults of Operations\nSeasonality and Cyclicality\nAs is typical for many software and technology companies, our business is subject to seasonal and cyclical factors. In most years, our revenue and operating income are typically highest in the fourth quarter and lowest in the first quarter (prior to the impact of unusual or nonrecurring items). Moreover, revenue and operating income in the first quarter of a new year may be lower than in the fourth quarter of the preceding year, in some years, by a significant margin. In addition, we generally receive a higher volume of orders in the last month of a quarter, with orders concentrated in the later part of that month. We believe that these seasonal and cyclical factors primarily reflect customer spending patterns and budget cycles, as well as the impact of incentive compensation plans for our sales personnel. While seasonal and cyclical factors such as these are common in the software and technology industry, this pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future revenue or financial performance. Many other factors, including general economic conditions, may also have an impact on our business and financial results.\nOverview of Operating Results\nThe following table sets forth a summary of certain key financial information for the years ended January 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014: Table 115: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended January 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands, except per share data)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,130,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,128,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>907,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67,852\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>122,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to Verint Systems Inc. common shares\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,638\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,583\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income per common share attributable to Verint Systems Inc.:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Basic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.01\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Diluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.52\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.99\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended January 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2015. Our revenue increased approximately $1.9 million to $1,130.3 million in the year ended January 31, 2016 from $1,128.4 million in the year ended January 31, 2015. The increase consisted of a $34.1 million increase in service and support revenue, offset by a $32.2 million decrease in product revenue. In our Cyber Intelligence segment, revenue increased approximately $26.0 million, or 7%, from $359.4 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 to $385.4 million in the year ended January 31, 2016. The increase consisted of a $31.0 million increase in service and support revenue and a $5.0 million decrease in product revenue. In our Video Intelligence segment, revenue increased approximately $8.5 million, or 8%, from $110.4 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 to $118.9 million in the year ended January 31, 2016, primarily due to an increase in product revenue. In our Enterprise Intelligence segment, revenue decreased approximately $32.8 million, or 5%, to $625.9 million in the year ended January 31, 2016 from $658.7 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 due to a decrease in product revenue. For additional details on our revenue by segment, see \"-Revenue by Operating Segment\". Revenue in the Americas, EMEA, and APAC represented approximately 51%, 31%, and 18% of our total revenue, respectively, in the year ended January 31, 2016, compared to approximately 52%, 31%, and 17%, respectively, in the year ended January 31, 2015. Further details of changes in revenue are provided below.\nOperating income was $67.9 million in the year ended January 31, 2016 compared to $79.1 million in the year ended January 31, 2015. This decrease in operating income was primarily due to an $11.9 million decrease in gross profit primarily due to decreased gross profit in our Enterprise Intelligence segment and a $0.7 million decrease in operating expenses, which consisted of a $4.0 million increase in net research and development expenses, offset by a $2.6 million decrease in selling, general and administrative expense and a $2.1 million decrease in amortization of other acquired intangible assets. Further details of changes in operating income are provided below.\nNet income attributable to Verint Systems Inc. common shares was $17.6 million, and diluted net income per common share was $0.28, in the year ended January 31, 2016 compared to net income attributable to Verint Systems Inc. common shares of $30.9 million, and diluted net income per common share of $0.52, in the year ended January 31, 2015. The decrease in net income attributable to Verint Systems Inc. and diluted net income per common share in the year ended January 31, 2016 was primarily due to a $16.0 million decrease in our benefit for income taxes, from a benefit of $15.0 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 to an expense of $1.0 million in the year ended January 31, 2016, and decreased operating income, as described above. These decreases to net income attributable to Verint Systems Inc. common shares were partially offset by a $13.0 million decrease in other expense, net, primarily due to losses upon early retirement of debt recorded during the year ended January 31, 2015, with no comparable losses during the year ended January 31, 2016. Further details of changes in total other expense, net, are provided below.\nA portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and therefore our revenue and operating expenses are affected by fluctuations in applicable foreign currency exchange rates. When comparing average exchange rates for the year ended January 31, 2016 to average exchange rates for the year ended January 31, 2015, the U.S. dollar strengthened relative to the British pound sterling, euro, Israeli shekel (both hedged and unhedged), Australian dollar, Brazilian real, and Singapore dollar, resulting in an overall decrease in our revenue (primarily in our Enterprise Intelligence and Cyber Intelligence segments), cost of revenue, and operating expenses on a U.S. dollar-denominated basis. For the year ended January 31, 2016, had foreign exchange rates remained unchanged from rates in effect for the year ended January 31, 2015, our revenue would have been approximately $40.0 million higher and our cost of revenue and operating expenses on a combined basis would have been approximately $44.6 million higher, which would have resulted in a $4.6 million decrease in operating income.\nCurrently, we employ approximately 5,000 professionals, including part-time employees and certain contractors, as compared to approximately 4,800 at January 31, 2015.\nYear Ended January 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2014. Our revenue increased approximately $221.1 million, or 24%, to $1,128.4 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 from $907.3 million in the year ended January 31, 2014. In our Enterprise Intelligence segment, revenue increased approximately $159.8 million, or 32%, to $658.7 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 from $498.9 million in the year ended January 31, 2014. The increase consisted of a $132.9 million increase in service and support revenue and a $26.9 million increase in product revenue. In our Cyber Intelligence segment, revenue increased approximately $71.4 million, or 25%, from $288.0 million in the year ended January 31, 2014 to $359.4 million in the year ended January 31, 2015. The increase consisted of a $54.9 million increase in product revenue and a $16.5 million increase in service and support revenue. In our Video Intelligence segment, revenue decreased approximately $10.0 million, or 8%, from $120.4 million in the year ended January 31, 2014 to $110.4 million in the year ended January 31, 2015, primarily due to a decrease in product revenue. For additional details on our revenue by segment, see \"-Revenue by Operating Segment\". Revenue in the Americas, EMEA, and APAC represented approximately 52%, 31%, and 17% of our total revenue, respectively, in the year ended January 31, 2015, compared to approximately 56%, 20%, and 24%, respectively, in the year ended January 31, 2014. The change in the percentage of revenue by geographical region in the year ended January 31, 2015 compared to the year ended January 31, 2014 primarily reflected the timing of revenue recognized in those regions under several large contracts, primarily in our Cyber Intelligence segment. Further details of changes in revenue are provided below.\nOperating income was $79.1 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 compared to $122.3 million in the year ended January 31, 2014. This decrease in operating income was primarily due to a $155.6 million increase in operating expenses, from $478.6 million to $634.2 million, partially offset by a $112.4 million increase in gross profit from $600.9 million to $713.3 million. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to increased gross profit in our Enterprise Intelligence and Communication Intelligence segments. Despite the increase in gross profit, our overall gross margin decreased from 66% in the year ended January 31, 2014 to 63% in the year ended January 31, 2015 primarily due to a change in the mix of services attributable to a business combination in our Enterprise Intelligence segment that closed during the year ended January 31, 2015. The increase in operating expenses consisted of an $87.9 million increase in selling, general and administrative expense, a $47.2 million increase in net research and development expenses, and a $20.5 million increase in amortization of other acquired intangible assets. Further details of changes in operating income are provided below.\nNet income attributable to Verint Systems Inc. common shares was $30.9 million, and diluted net income per common share was $0.52, in the year ended January 31, 2015 compared to net income attributable to Verint Systems Inc. common shares of $53.6 million, and diluted net income per common share of $0.99, in the year ended January 31, 2014. The decrease in net income attributable to Verint Systems Inc. common shares and diluted net income per common share in the year ended January 31, 2015 was primarily due to our decreased operating income, as described above, a $6.9 million increase in interest expense, and a $2.6 million increase in losses upon early retirement of debt recorded during year ended January 31, 2015 compared to the year ended January 31, 2014. These decreases to net income attributable to Verint Systems Inc. common shares were partially offset by and a $19.5 million decrease in our (benefit) provision for income taxes and a $10.7 million decrease in other expense, net. During the year ended January 31, 2015, other expense, net, included net foreign currency losses of $13.4 million, partially offset by net gains on derivative instruments of $4.0 million. During the year ended January 31, 2014, other expense, net, included a charge of $12.9 million for the derecognition of an indemnification asset associated with the resolution of an uncertain tax position previously recorded in connection with the CTI Merger and net foreign currency losses of $6.1 million. Further details of changes in total other expense, net, are provided below.\nWhen comparing average exchange rates for the year ended January 31, 2015 to average exchange rates for the year ended January 31, 2014, while the U.S. dollar weakened relative to the British pound sterling and our hedged Israeli shekel rate, it strengthened relative to the euro, Australian dollar, Japanese yen, Brazilian real, and Singapore dollar, resulting in an overall decrease in our revenue and cost of revenue. For operating expenses, the impact of the weakened U.S. dollar relative to the British pound sterling and our hedged Israeli shekel rate was greater than the impact of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, Australian dollar, Japanese yen, Brazilian real, and Singapore dollar, resulting in an increase in operating expenses on a U.S. dollar-denominated basis. For the year ended January 31, 2015, had foreign exchange rates remained unchanged from rates in effect for the year ended January 31, 2014, our revenue would have been approximately $4.2 million higher and our cost of revenue and operating expenses on a combined basis would have been approximately $3.8 million lower, which would have resulted in a $8.0 million increase in operating income.\nAs of January 31, 2015, we employed approximately 4,800 employees, including part-time employees and certain contractors, as compared to approximately 3,400 at January 31, 2014. This increase was due to a combination of acquisitions and organic growth during the twelve months ended January 31, 2015.\nRevenue by Operating Segment\nThe following table sets forth revenue for each of our three operating segments for the years ended January 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014: Table 116: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 - 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 - 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Enterprise Intelligence\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>625,943\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>658,671\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>498,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cyber Intelligence\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>385,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>359,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>288,003\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Video Intelligence\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>118,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>110,370\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>120,388\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,130,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,128,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>907,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEnterprise Intelligence Segment\nYear Ended January 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2015. Enterprise Intelligence revenue decreased approximately $32.8 million, or 5%, from $658.7 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 to $625.9 million in the year ended January 31, 2016. The decrease consisted of a $31.9 million decrease in product revenue and a $0.9 million decrease in service and support revenue. The decrease in product revenue primarily reflects a lower aggregate value of executed license arrangements, which comprises the majority of our product revenue and which can fluctuate from period to period. The decrease in service and support revenue was primarily due to a decrease in revenue from professional services and consulting projects in the year ended January 31, 2016, partially offset by an increase in support revenue. As mentioned above, our revenue during the year ended January 31, 2016 was also adversely affected by the impact of the strengthening of the U.S dollar relative to foreign locations currencies where we conduct business.\nYear Ended January 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2014. Enterprise Intelligence revenue increased approximately $159.8 million, or 32%, from $498.9 million in the year ended January 31, 2014 to $658.7 million in the year ended January 31, 2015. The increase consisted of a $132.9 million increase in service and support revenue and a $26.9 million increase in product revenue. The increase in service and support revenue was primarily due to an increase in our customer install base, both organically and through business combinations, and the related support revenue generated from this customer base during the year ended January 31, 2015, as well as increased revenue from new service offerings in the year ended January 31, 2015. The increase in product revenue was due to an increase in product sales to new customers during the year ended January 31, 2015. The growth of service revenue relative to product revenue was attributable to various factors, including an increase in services associated with customer product upgrades, a higher component of service offerings in our standard arrangements, and growth in our install base, both organically and as a result of business combinations, through the end of such period.\nCyber Intelligence Segment\nYear Ended January 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2015. Cyber Intelligence revenue increased approximately $26.0 million, or 7%, from $359.4 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 to $385.4 million in the year ended January 31, 2016. The increase consisted of a $31.0 million increase in service and support revenue, partially offset by a $5.0 million decrease in product revenue. The increase in service and support revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in progress realized during the current year on projects with revenue recognized using the percentage of completion (\"POC\") method, some of which commenced in the previous fiscal year, and an increase in support revenue from new and existing customers. The decrease in product revenue was primarily due to a decrease in product deliveries to customers, partially offset by an increase in progress realized during the current year on projects with revenue recognized using the POC method, some of which commenced in the previous fiscal year. As mentioned above, our revenue during the year ended January 31, 2016 was also adversely affected by the impact of the strengthening of the U.S dollar relative to the currencies used in the foreign locations where we conduct business.\nYear Ended January 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2014. Cyber Intelligence revenue increased approximately $71.4 million, or 25%, from $288.0 million in the year ended January 31, 2014 to $359.4 million in the year ended January 31, 2015. The increase consisted of a $54.9 million increase in product revenue and a $16.5 million increase in service and support revenue. The increase in product revenue was primarily due to an increase in product deliveries to customers and an increase in progress realized during the year ended January 31, 2015 on projects with revenue recognized using the POC method, some of which commenced in the previous fiscal year. The increase in service and support revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in progress realized during the year ended January 31, 2015 on projects with revenue recognized using the POC\nmethod, some of which commenced in the previous fiscal year, and an increase in revenue from software-as-a-service (\"SaaS\") offerings.\nVideo Intelligence Segment\nYear Ended January 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2015. Video Intelligence revenue increased approximately $8.5 million, or 8%, from $110.4 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 to $118.9 million in the year ended January 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in product deliveries to customers during the year ended January 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended January 31, 2015.\nYear Ended January 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2014. Video Intelligence revenue decreased approximately $10.0 million, or 8%, from $120.4 million in the year ended January 31, 2014 to $110.4 million in the year ended January 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in sales of certain hardware products to a single large customer during the year ended January 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended January 31, 2014.\nVolume and Price\nWe sell products in multiple configurations, and the price of any particular product varies depending on the configuration of the product sold. Due to the variety of customized configurations for each product we sell, we are unable to quantify the amount of any revenue increase attributable to a change in the price of any particular product and/or a change in the number of products sold.\nProduct Revenue and Service and Support Revenue\nWe derive and report our revenue in two categories: (a) product revenue, including licensing of software products and sale of hardware products (which include software that works together with the hardware to deliver the product's essential functionality), and (b) service and support revenue, including revenue from installation services, post-contract customer support, project management, hosting services, SaaS, application managed services, product warranties, and business advisory consulting and training services. For multiple-element arrangements for which we are unable to establish VSOE for one or more elements, we use various available indicators of fair value and apply our best judgment to reasonably classify the arrangement's revenue into product revenue and service and support revenue.\nThe following table sets forth product revenue and service and support revenue for the years ended January 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014:\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 - 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 - 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>455,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>487,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>416,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service and support revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>674,860\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>640,819\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>490,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,130,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,128,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>907,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduct Revenue\nYear Ended January 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2015. Product revenue decreased approximately $32.2 million, or 7%, from $487.6 million for the year ended January 31, 2015 to $455.4 million for the year ended January 31, 2016, resulting from a $31.9 million decrease in our Enterprise Intelligence segment and a $5.0 million decrease in our Cyber Intelligence segment, partially offset by a $4.7 million increase in our Video Intelligence segment.\nYear Ended January 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2014. Product revenue increased approximately $71.1 million, or 17%, from $416.5 million for the year ended January 31, 2014 to $487.6 million for the year ended January 31, 2015, resulting from a $54.9 million increase in our Cyber Intelligence segment and a $26.9 million increase in our Enterprise Intelligence segment, partially offset by a $10.7 million decrease in our Video Intelligence segment.\nFor additional information see \"-Revenue by Operating Segment\".\nService and Support Revenue\nYear Ended January 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2015. Service and support revenue increased approximately $34.1 million, or 5%, from $640.8 million for the year ended January 31, 2015 to $674.9 million for the year ended January 31, 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to increases of $31.0 million and $3.8 million in our Cyber Intelligence and Video Intelligence segments, respectively, partially offset by a $0.9 million decrease in our Enterprise Intelligence segment.\nYear Ended January 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2014. Service and support revenue increased approximately $150.0 million, or 31%, from $490.8 million for the year ended January 31, 2014 to $640.8 million for the year ended January 31, 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to increases of $132.9 million and $16.5 million in our Enterprise Intelligence and Cyber Intelligence segments, respectively.\nFor additional information see \"- Revenue by Operating Segment\".\nCost of Revenue\nThe following table sets forth cost of revenue by product and service and support, as well as amortization of acquired technology and backlog for the years ended January 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014:\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 - 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 - 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of product revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>145,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>144,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>137,558\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of service and support revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>248,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>239,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>156,593\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of acquired technology and backlog\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>153%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cost of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>428,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>415,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>306,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe exclude certain costs of both product revenue and service and support revenue, including shared support costs, stock-based compensation, and asset impairment charges, among others, when calculating our operating segment gross margins.\nCost of Product Revenue\nCost of product revenue primarily consists of hardware material costs and royalties due to third parties for software components that are embedded in our software solutions. When revenue is deferred, we also defer hardware material costs and third-party software royalties and recognize those costs over the same period that the product revenue is recognized. Cost of product revenue also includes amortization of capitalized software development costs, employee compensation and related expenses associated with our global operations, facility costs, and other allocated overhead expenses. In our Cyber Intelligence segment, cost of product revenue also includes employee compensation and related expenses, contractor and consulting expenses, and travel expenses, in each case for resources dedicated to project management and associated product delivery.\nOur product gross margins are impacted by the mix of products that we sell from period to period. As with many other technology companies, our software products tend to have higher gross margins than our hardware products.\nYear Ended January 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2015. Cost of product revenue remained relatively unchanged at $145.1 million for the year ended January 31, 2016 compared to $144.9 million for the year ended January 31, 2015. For the year ended January 31, 2016, we recorded a $3.2 million charge for the impairment of certain technology assets associated with a prior business combination in our Cyber Intelligence segment. For the year ended January 31, 2015, we recorded a $2.6 million charge for the impairment of certain capitalized software development costs, reflecting strategy changes in certain product development initiatives in our Cyber Intelligence segment as a result of the UTX acquisition. Our overall product gross margins decreased to 68% in the year ended January 31, 2016 from 70% in the year ended January 31, 2015. As noted above, certain costs are not allocated to our operating segments when we calculate product gross margins by operating segment. Product gross margins in our Enterprise Intelligence segment decreased to 93% in the year ended January 31, 2016 from 94% in the year ended January 31, 2015. Product gross margins in our Cyber Intelligence segment increased from 61% in the year ended January 31, 2015 to 62% in the year ended January 31, 2016. Product gross margins in our Video Intelligence segment increased to 60% in the year ended January 31, 2016 from 59% in the year ended January 31, 2015. The above changes in product gross margins are primarily attributable to changes in product mix in the year ended January 31, 2016 compared to the year ended January 31, 2015.\nYear Ended January 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2014. Cost of product revenue increased approximately 5% from $137.6 million in the year ended January 31, 2014 to $144.9 million in the year ended January 31, 2015. Our overall\nproduct gross margins increased to 70% in the year ended January 31, 2015 from 67% in the year ended January 31, 2014. Product gross margins in our Enterprise Intelligence segment increased from 92% in the year ended January 31, 2014 to 94% in the year ended January 31, 2015 primarily due to a continued decrease in hardware sales as part of our product offerings. Product gross margins in our Cyber Intelligence segment increased from 56% in the year ended January 31, 2014 to 61% in the year ended January 31, 2015 primarily due to a change in product mix. Product gross margins in our Video Intelligence segment increased to 59% in the year ended January 31, 2015 compared to 58% in the year ended January 31, 2014 due to a change in product mix.\nCost of Service and Support Revenue\nCost of service and support revenue primarily consists of employee compensation and related expenses, contractor costs, and travel expenses relating to installation, training, application managed services, consulting, and maintenance services. Cost of service and support revenue also includes stock-based compensation expenses, facility costs, and other overhead expenses. In accordance with GAAP and our accounting policy, the cost of service and support revenue is generally expensed as incurred in the period in which the services are performed, with the exception of certain transactions accounted for using the POC method.\nYear Ended January 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2015. Cost of service and support revenue increased approximately 4% from $239.3 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 to $248.1 million in the year ended January 31, 2016. The increase is primarily attributable to an $11.3 million increase in employee compensation and related expenses due primarily to increased services and support employee headcount chiefly in our Cyber Intelligence segment, and a $3.4 million increase in contractor costs due to increase use of contractors in our Cyber Intelligence and Enterprise Intelligence segments during the year ended January 31, 2016 compared to the year ended January 31, 2015. These increases were partially offset by a $2.4 million decrease in travel expenses primarily in our Enterprise Intelligence segment and a $1.3 million decrease in materials expense incurred to provide services primarily in our Enterprise Intelligence segment. Our overall service and support gross margins were 63% in each of the years ended January 31, 2016 and 2015.\nYear Ended January 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2014. Cost of service and support revenue increased approximately 53% from $156.6 million in the year ended January 31, 2014 to $239.3 million in the year ended January 31, 2015. Employee compensation and related expenses increased $51.3 million due primarily to increased headcount in our Enterprise Intelligence segment in connection with a business combination that closed during the year ended January 31, 2015. Contractor costs, travel expense, and materials expense incurred to provide services increased $10.2 million, $5.2 million, and $8.2 million, respectively, primarily due to a business combination that closed during the year ended January 31, 2015 in our Enterprise Intelligence segment. Stock-based compensation expense increased $3.4 million resulting from an increase in average amounts of outstanding restricted stock units, and increases in our stock price during such period, which impacted the total stock-based compensation to be recognized over the vesting periods. Our overall service and support gross margins decreased from 68% in the year ended January 31, 2014 to 63% in the year ended January 31, 2015 primarily due to a change in the mix of services in connection with a business combination that closed during the year ended January 31, 2015 in our Enterprise Intelligence segment.\nAmortization of Acquired Technology and Backlog\nAmortization of acquired technology and backlog consists of amortization of technology assets and customer backlog acquired in connection with business combinations.\nYear Ended January 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2015. Amortization of acquired technology and backlog increased approximately 15% from $31.0 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 to $35.8 million in the year ended January 31, 2016 primarily due to an increase in amortization expense of acquired technology-based intangible assets associated with business combinations that closed during the year ended January 31, 2016.\nYear Ended January 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2014. Amortization of acquired technology and backlog increased approximately 153% from $12.3 million in the year ended January 31, 2014 to $31.0 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 primarily due to an increase in amortization expense of acquired technology-based intangible assets associated with business combinations that closed during the year ended January 31, 2015.\nFurther discussion regarding our business combinations appears in Note 4, \"Business Combinations\" to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this report.\nResearch and Development, Net\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and subcontracting expenses, facility costs, and other allocated overhead, net of certain software development costs that are capitalized, as well as reimbursements under government programs. Software development costs are capitalized upon the establishment of technological feasibility and continue to be capitalized through the general release of the related software product.\nThe following table sets forth research and development, net for the years ended January 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014:\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 - 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 - 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>177,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>173,748\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>126,539\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended January 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2015. Research and development, net increased approximately $4.0 million, or 2%, from $173.7 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 to $177.7 million in the year ended January 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to a $2.8 million increase in stock-based compensation expense due to a combination of an increase in the number of outstanding RSUs, higher expenses associated with performance-based RSUs, and higher grant-date stock prices during the year ended January 31, 2016 (which are used to determine the grant-date fair value of an RSU), and our bonus share program, further details for which appear in Note 13, \"Stock-Based Compensation\" to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this report. Contractor expenses increased $0.8 million due to increased use of contractors for research and development activities in our Cyber Intelligence segment during the year ended January 31, 2016 compared to the year ended January 31, 2015. Research and development reimbursements received from government programs decreased $1.1 million during the year ended January 31, 2016, primarily in our Enterprise Intelligence segment, resulting in an increase in research and development expense compared to the year ended January 31, 2015. These increases were partially offset by a $0.9 million decrease in employee compensation and related expenses due to decreased research and development employee headcount in our Enterprise Intelligence segment.\nYear Ended January 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2014. Research and development, net increased approximately $47.2 million, or 37%, from $126.5 million in the year ended January 31, 2014 to $173.7 million in the year ended January 31, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to a $37.0 million increase in employee compensation and related expenses due to an increase in employee headcount in connection with business combinations that closed during the year ended January 31, 2015 in our Enterprise Intelligence and Communication Intelligence segments. Stock-based compensation expense increased $3.0 million resulting from an increase in average amounts of outstanding restricted stock units, and an increase in our stock price during such period (which impacted the total stock-based compensation to be recognized over the vesting periods). Contractor expense increased $2.4 million due to increased use of contractors for research and development activities in our Cyber Intelligence segment during the year ended January 31, 2015 compared to the year ended January 31, 2014.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and related expenses, professional fees, sales and marketing expenses, including travel, sales commissions and sales referral fees, facility costs, communication expenses, and other administrative expenses.\nThe following table sets forth selling, general and administrative expenses for the years ended January 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014:\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 - 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 - 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>412,728\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>415,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>327,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended January 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2015. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased approximately $2.6 million, or 1%, from $415.3 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 to $412.7 million in the year ended January 31, 2016. Sales commissions expense decreased $3.8 million due primarily to decreased product bookings in our Enterprise Intelligence segment. Employee compensation and related expenses decreased $2.8 million due primarily to a decrease in headcount of general and administrative employees in our Enterprise Intelligence segment. Accounting, legal, and other professional service fees decreased $2.3 million primarily due to higher use of such services during the year ended January 31, 2015 as a result of services provided in connection with the KANA and UTX acquisitions. Travel expenses decreased $2.1 million due primarily to decreased travel expenses in our Enterprise Intelligence segment. The change in fair\nvalue of our obligations under contingent consideration arrangements was a $0.9 million benefit during the year ended January 31, 2016 compared to $0.9 million expense during the year ended January 31, 2015, resulting in a $1.8 million decrease in selling, general, and administrative expense. These decreases were partially offset by increases of $6.4 million and $2.5 million in stock-based compensation expense and facilities expenses, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense increased primarily due to a combination of an increase in the number of outstanding RSUs, higher expenses associated with performance-based RSUs, and higher grant-date stock prices during the year ended January 31, 2016 (which are used to determine the grant-date fair value of an RSU), and our bonus share program, further details for which appear in Note 13, \"Stock-Based Compensation\" to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this report. Facilities expenses increased due primarily to the early termination of a facility lease in the Americas region, and costs associated with entering our new headquarters in Melville, NY.\nYear Ended January 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2014. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately $87.9 million, or 27%, from $327.4 million in the year ended January 31, 2014 to $415.3 million in the year ended January 31, 2015. Employee compensation and related expenses increased $34.5 million due primarily to increased employee headcount in our Enterprise Intelligence and Cyber Intelligence segments, as well as an increase in employee headcount for corporate support employees. Stock-based compensation expense increased $12.6 million due primarily to an increase in average amounts of outstanding restricted stock units, and an increase in our stock price during the period (which impacted the total stock-based compensation to be recognized over the vesting periods). Sales and marketing expense, travel expense, and facilities expense increased $3.8 million, $4.0 million, and $6.4 million, respectively, due primarily to business combinations that closed during the year ended January 31. 2015. Also contributing to the increase in selling, general, and administrative expense was a $9.9 million increase in agent commissions expense in our Communication Intelligence segment, a $5.6 million increase in contractor expense due primarily to increased use of contractors for corporate support activities, including acquisition and integration related expenses, and a $3.5 million increase in the change in fair value of our obligations under contingent consideration arrangements. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $3.5 million in expenses from special performance incentives associated with a prior period business combination that were included in selling, general, and administrative expenses for the year ended January 31, 2014 with no equivalent expenses in the year ended January 31, 2015.\nAmortization of Other Acquired Intangible Assets\nAmortization of other acquired intangible assets consists of amortization of certain intangible assets acquired in connection with business combinations, including customer relationships, distribution networks, trade names and non-compete agreements.\nThe following table sets forth amortization of other acquired intangible assets for the years ended January 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014:\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 - 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 - 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of other acquired intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,662\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended January 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2015. Amortization of other acquired intangible assets decreased approximately $2.1 million, or 5%, from $45.2 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 to $43.1 million in the year ended January 31, 2016 primarily due to acquired intangible assets from historical business combinations becoming fully amortized during the year ended January 31, 2016, resulting in decreased amortization on those intangibles compared to the year ended January 31, 2015. This decrease was partially offset by amortization associated with business combinations that closed during the year ended January 31, 2016.\nYear Ended January 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2014. Amortization of other acquired intangible assets increased approximately $20.5 million, or 83%, from $24.7 million in the year ended January 31, 2014 to $45.2 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 primarily due to amortization associated with business combinations that closed during the year ended January 31, 2015.\nFurther discussion regarding our business combinations appears in Note 4, \"Business Combinations\" to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this report.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nThe following table sets forth total other expense, net for the years ended January 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014:\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 - 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 - 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,490\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>963\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(33,885\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(36,661\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29,780\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Losses on early retirements of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,546\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,879\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency (losses) gains\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,037\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13,402\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,057\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(40)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gains on derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,986\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(90)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Derecognition of indemnification asset related to CTI Merger\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,874\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,634\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(155\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,689\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(91)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other income (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,277\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,571\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20,275\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(53)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(44,672\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(57,708\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(58,971\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Percentage is not meaningful.\nYear Ended January 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2015. Total other expense, net, decreased by $13.0 million from $57.7 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 to $44.7 million in the year ended January 31, 2016.\nDuring the year ended January 31, 2015, we recorded a $12.5 million loss upon early retirements of debt. Of this amount, $7.1 million was recorded in connection with the extinguishment of the March 2013 Term Loans (defined below), and $5.5 million was recorded in connection with the retirement of $530.0 million of the February 2014 Term Loans and March 2014 Term Loans (defined below). Further discussion regarding our credit facilities appears in Note 6, Long-Term Debt\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this report.\nInterest expense decreased to $33.9 million in the year ended January 31, 2016 from $36.7 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 primarily due to lower interest rates on outstanding borrowings during the year ended January 31, 2016.\nWe recorded $8.0 million of net foreign currency losses in the year ended January 31, 2016 compared to $13.4 million of net losses in the year ended January 31, 2015. Foreign currency losses in the year ended January 31, 2016 resulted primarily from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Singapore dollar, euro, and Canadian dollar resulting in foreign currency losses on our Singapore dollar, euro, and Canadian dollar-denominated net assets, respectively, in certain entities which use a U.S. dollar functional currency. Also contributing to the net foreign currency loss was the strengthening of the U.S dollar against the British pound sterling, resulting in foreign currency losses on U.S dollar-denominated net liabilities in certain entities which use a British pound sterling functional currency, and the strengthening of the U.S dollar against the Brazilian real, resulting in foreign currency losses on U.S dollar denominated net liabilities in certain entities which use a Brazilian real functional currency.\nIn the year ended January 31, 2016, there were net gains on derivative financial instruments (not designated as hedging instruments) of $0.4 million, compared to net gains of $4.0 million on such instruments for the year ended January 31, 2015. The net gains in the current year reflected gains on contracts executed to hedge movements in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro.\nOther, net, expense increased to $4.6 million in the year ended January 31, 2016 from $0.2 million in the year ended January 31, 2015. Other, net, expense in the year ended January 31, 2016 consisted primarily of write-offs of indemnification assets associated with tax liabilities recorded in connection with prior business combinations.\nYear Ended January 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2014. Total other expense, net, decreased by $1.3 million from $59.0 million in the year ended January 31, 2014 to $57.7 million in the year ended January 31, 2015.\nDuring the year ended January 31, 2015, we recorded $12.5 million of losses upon early retirements of debt. Of this amount, $7.1 million was recorded in connection with the early retirement of the March 2013 Term Loans (defined below), and $5.5 million was recorded in connection with the early retirement of $530.0 million of the February 2014 Term Loans and March 2014 Term Loans (defined below). Further discussion regarding our credit facilities appears in Note 6, Long-Term Debt\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this report.\nInterest expense increased to $36.7 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 from $29.8 million in the year ended January 31, 2014 primarily due to incremental borrowings discussed in Note 6, Long-Term Debt\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this report.\nWe recorded $13.4 million of net foreign currency losses in the year ended January 31, 2015 compared to $6.1 million of net losses in the year ended January 31, 2014. Foreign currency losses in the year ended January 31, 2015 resulted primarily from (i) strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound sterling, resulting in foreign currency losses on U.S. dollar-denominated net liabilities in certain entities which use a British pound sterling functional currency, (ii) weakening of the euro against the British pound sterling, resulting in foreign currency losses on euro-denominated net assets in certain entities which use a British pound sterling functional currency, and (iii) strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Singapore dollar, resulting in foreign currency losses on Singapore dollar-denominated net assets in certain entities which use a U.S. dollar functional currency. Of the $13.4 million of net foreign currency losses in the year ended January 31, 2015, $12.4 million were recorded during the three months ended January 31, 2015.\nIn the year ended January 31, 2015, there were net gains on derivative financial instruments (not designated as hedging instruments) of $4.0 million, compared to net gains of $0.3 million on such instruments for the year ended January 31, 2014. The higher net gains in the current year reflected gains on contracts executed to hedge movements in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro.\nOther, net, expense decreased to $0.2 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 from $1.7 million in the year ended January 31, 2014 due to the inclusion of a $1.1 million write-off of an indemnification asset associated with tax liabilities recorded in connection with the CTI Merger in the year ended January 31, 2014, with no comparable expense in the year ended January 31, 2015.\nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes\nThe following table sets forth our provision (benefit) for income taxes for the years ended January 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014:\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 - 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 - 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision (benefit) for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>952\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(14,999\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,539\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Percentage is not meaningful.\nYear Ended January 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2015. Our effective income tax rate was 4.1% for the year ended January 31, 2016, compared to an effective income tax benefit rate of 70.1% for the year ended January 31, 2015. For the year ended January 31, 2016, our effective income tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 35% primarily due to mix and levels of income and losses among taxing jurisdictions and changes in unrecognized income tax benefits. We recorded tax benefits of $20.2 million as a result of audit settlements and statute of limitation lapses related to domestic and foreign jurisdictions. Pre-tax income in our profitable jurisdictions, where we recorded income tax provisions at rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate, was substantially offset by our domestic losses where we maintain valuation allowances and did not record the related income tax benefits. The result was an income tax provision of $1.0 million on $23.2 million of pre-tax income, which represented an effective income tax rate of 4.1%. For the year ended January 31, 2015, our effective income tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 35% primarily due to the release of $44.4 million of Verint valuation allowances. We maintain valuation allowances on our net U.S. deferred income tax assets related to federal and certain state jurisdictions. In connection with the acquisition of KANA on February 3, 2014, we recorded deferred income tax liabilities primarily attributable to acquired intangible assets to the extent the amortization will not be deductible for income tax purposes. Under accounting guidelines, because the amortization of the intangible assets in future periods provides a source of taxable income, we expect to realize a portion of our existing deferred income tax assets. As such, we reduced the valuation allowance recorded on our deferred income tax assets to the extent of the deferred income tax liabilities recorded. Because the valuation allowance related to existing Verint deferred income tax assets, the impact of the release was reflected as a discrete income tax benefit and not as a component of the KANA acquisition accounting. The effective income tax rate was also affected by the mix and levels of income and losses among taxing jurisdictions, changes in unrecognized income tax benefits, and the recording of valuation allowance on certain income tax attributes of a foreign subsidiary where we do not expect to realize the benefits. Pre-tax income in our profitable jurisdictions, where we recorded income tax provisions at rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate, was substantially offset by our domestic losses where we maintain valuation allowances and did not record the related income tax benefits. The result was an income tax benefit of $15.0 million on $21.4 million of pre-tax income, which represented an effective income tax benefit rate of 70.1%.\nYear Ended January 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2014. Our effective income tax benefit rate was 70.1% for the year ended January 31, 2015, compared to 7.2% for the year ended January 31, 2014. For the year ended January 31, 2015, our effective income tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 35% primarily due to the release of $44.4 million of Verint valuation allowances. As discussed in the prior paragraph, this resulted in an income tax benefit of $15.0 million on $21.4 million of pre-tax income, resulting in an income tax benefit rate of 70.1%. For the year ended January 31, 2014, our effective income tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 35% primarily due to the level and mix of income and losses by jurisdiction and an income tax benefit of $12.4 million for the reversal of unrecognized tax benefits established in connection with the CTI Merger. The recognition of the CTI income tax benefits resulted in a charge within other income (expense), net due to the write-off of an indemnification asset. Pre-tax income in our profitable jurisdictions, where we recorded income tax provisions at rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate, was partially offset by our domestic losses where we maintain valuation allowances and did not record the related income tax benefits. The result was an income tax provision of $4.5 million on $63.3 million of pre-tax income, which represented an effective income tax rate of 7.2%.\nThe comparison of our effective income tax rates between periods is significantly impacted by the level and mix of earnings and losses by tax jurisdiction, foreign income tax rate differentials, amount of permanent book to tax differences, the impact of unrecognized tax benefits, and the effects of valuation allowances on certain loss jurisdictions.\nBacklog\nWhile we have certain projects with multiple deliverables over longer periods of time, for most of our transactions, delivery generally occurs within several months following receipt of the order. As a result, we believe that our backlog at any particular time is not meaningful because it is not necessarily indicative of future revenue.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur primary recurring source of cash is the collection of proceeds from the sale of products and services to our customers, including cash periodically collected in advance of delivery or performance.\nOur primary recurring use of cash is payment of our operating costs, which consist primarily of employee-related expenses, such as compensation and benefits, as well as general operating expenses for marketing, facilities and overhead costs, and capital expenditures. We also utilize cash for debt service under our Credit Agreement and our Notes, and periodically for business acquisitions. Cash generated from operations, along with our existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, are our primary sources of operating liquidity, and we believe that our operating liquidity is sufficient to support our current business operations, including debt service and capital expenditure requirements.\nWe have historically expanded our business in part by investing in strategic growth initiatives, including acquisitions of products, technologies, and businesses. We have used cash as consideration for substantially all of our historical business acquisitions, including approximately $31 million of net cash expended for business acquisitions during the year ended January 31, 2016.\nWe continually examine our options with respect to terms and sources of existing and future short-term and long-term capital resources to enhance our operating results and to ensure that we retain financial flexibility, and may from time to time elect to raise additional equity or debt capital in the capital markets.\nA considerable portion of our operating income is earned outside the United States. Cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash and bank time deposits (including any long-term portions) held by our subsidiaries outside of the United States were $321.5 million and $297.2 million as of January 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and are generally used to fund the subsidiaries' operating requirements and to invest in growth initiatives, including business acquisitions. We currently do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations for the next 12 months or for the foreseeable future.\nShould other circumstances arise whereby we require more capital in the United States than is generated by our domestic operations, or should we otherwise consider it in our best interests, we could repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions, which could result in higher effective tax rates. If available, our NOLs, particularly those in the United States, could reduce potential income tax liabilities that may result from repatriated earnings from foreign jurisdictions to the United\nStates. We generally have not provided for deferred income taxes on the excess of the amount for financial reporting over the tax basis of investments in our foreign subsidiaries because we currently plan to indefinitely reinvest such earnings outside the United States.\nThe following table sets forth our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and bank time deposits, short-term investments and long-term debt as of January 31, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>352,105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>285,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restricted cash and bank time deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,920\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55,982\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and bank time deposits, and short-term investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>419,907\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>357,743\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total debt, including current maturities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>738,087\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>726,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur operating activities generated $156.9 million of cash during the year ended January 31, 2016, which was partially offset by $85.8 million of net cash used in combined investing and financing activities during this period.

Operating activities generated $156.9 million of net cash during the year ended January 31, 2016, compared to $193.7 million generated during the year ended January 31, 2015.\nOperating activities generated $193.7 million of net cash during the year ended January 31, 2015, compared to $178.3 million generated during the year ended January 31, 2014. Our operating results for the year ended January 31, 2015 included $122.1 million of net non-cash expenses, compared to $97.3 million of net non-cash expenses in the prior year, so despite reporting lower net income in the year ended January 31, 2015 compared to the prior year, our operating cash flow improved.\nOur cash flow from operating activities can fluctuate from period to period due to several factors, including the timing of our billings and collections, the timing and amounts of interest, income tax and other payments, and our operating results.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nDuring the year ended January 31, 2016, our investing activities used $75.6 million of net cash, the primary components of which were $31.4 million of net cash utilized for business acquisitions, $30.3 million of payments for property, equipment, and capitalized software development costs, and $21.4 million of net purchases of short-term investments during the year.\nPartially offsetting those uses was $7.5 million of net cash provided by other investing activities, consisting primarily of decreases in restricted cash and bank time deposits during the period. Restricted cash and bank time deposits are typically short-term deposits used to secure bank guarantees in connection with customer sales contracts, the amounts of which will fluctuate from period to period.\nDuring the year ended January 31, 2015, our investing activities used $676.8 million of net cash, the primary component of which was $605.3 million of net cash utilized for business acquisitions, including the acquisitions of KANA in February 2014 and UTX in March 2014. We also had a $36.3 million increase in restricted cash and bank time deposits during this period. The increase in restricted cash and bank time deposits during the year reflected deposits associated with several large sales contracts. In addition, during the year we made $29.2 million of payments for property, equipment, and capitalized software development costs, and made $7.5 million of net purchases of short-term investments.\nDuring the year ended January 31, 2014, our investing activities used $64.2 million of net cash, the primary components of which were $32.8 million of net cash utilized for business acquisitions, $22.4 million of payments for property, equipment, and capitalized software development costs, and $18.9 million of net purchases of short-term investments. Partially offsetting these uses was a $7.7 million decrease in restricted cash and bank time deposits.\nWe had no significant commitments for capital expenditures at January 31, 2016.\nNet Cash (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities\nFor the year ended January 31, 2016, our financing activities used $10.2 million of net cash, including payments of $7.2 million for the financing portion of payments under contingent consideration arrangements related to prior business combinations, and dividend payments of $3.2 million to the noncontrolling interest holders in a joint venture which serves as a systems integrator for certain Asian markets.\nFor the year ended January 31, 2015, our financing activities provided $395.7 million of net cash. In connection with the February 2014 acquisition of KANA, we incurred $300.0 million of incremental term loans and borrowed $125.0 million under the revolving credit facility under our Credit Agreement (defined below). Additionally, in March 2014, we incurred $643.5 million of new term loans, the proceeds of which were used to repay $643.5 million of prior term loans. In June 2014, we completed concurrent public offerings of 5,750,000 shares of our common stock, gross proceeds from which were $274.6 million, and $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.50% convertible senior notes. We used $15.6 million of the net proceeds from these offerings to pay the net costs of an arrangement consisting of the purchase of call options and the sale of warrants to purchase our common stock, the intent of which is to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon conversion of the Notes. We used the majority of the remainder of the net proceeds to retire $530.0 million of the February 2014 Term Loans and March 2014 Term Loans, and all $106.0 million of then-outstanding borrowings under the rvolving credit facility under our Credit Agreement. In connection with these various financing activities, we paid $29.2 million of debt and equity issuance costs, including underwriting discounts and commissions associated with the public offerings. Other financing activities during the year ended January 31, 2015 included payments of $10.4 million for the financing portion of payments under contingent consideration arrangements related to prior business combinations, and the receipt of $17.6 million of proceeds from exercises of stock options.\nFor the year ended January 31, 2014, our financing activities provided $54.5 million of net cash. During this period, we borrowed $646.7 million under our Credit Agreement, repaid $576.0 million of outstanding borrowings under our prior Credit Agreement, and paid $7.8 million of related debt issuance costs. We also received $10.4 million of cash in connection with the CTI Merger during this year. Other financing activities during the year ended January 31, 2014 included payments of $16.1 million for the financing portion of payments under contingent consideration arrangements related to prior business combinations, and the receipt of $10.9 million of proceeds from exercises of stock options.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources Requirements\nBased on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated operating costs, required payments of principal and interest, working capital needs, ordinary course capital expenditures, research and development spending, and other commitments for at least the next 12 months. Currently, we have no plans to pay any cash dividends on our common stock, which are not permitted under our Credit Agreement.\nOur liquidity could be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand for our products and service and support, including the impact of changes in customer buying behavior due to circumstances over which we have no control. If we determine to make additional business acquisitions or otherwise require additional funds, we may need to raise additional capital, which could involve the issuance of additional equity or debt securities.\nOn March 29, 2016, we announced that our board of directors had authorized a new share repurchase program whereby we may make up to $150 million in purchases of our outstanding shares of common stock over the two years following the date of announcement. Under the share repurchase program, purchases can be made from time to time using a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases. The specific timing, price and size of purchases will depend on prevailing stock prices, general market and economic conditions, and other considerations, including the amount of cash generated in the U.S. and other potential uses of cash, such as acquisitions. Purchases may be made through a Rule 10b5-1 plan pursuant to pre-determined metrics set forth in such plan. The board of directors' authorization of the share repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.\nFinancing Arrangements\n1.50% Convertible Senior Notes\nOn June 18, 2014, we issued $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.50% convertible senior notes due June 1, 2021, unless earlier converted by the holders pursuant to their terms. The Notes pay interest in cash semiannually in arrears at a rate of 1.50% per annum.\nThe Notes were issued concurrently with our issuance of 5,750,000 shares of common stock, the majority of the combined net proceeds of which were used to partially repay certain indebtedness under our Credit Agreement, as further described below.\nThe Notes are unsecured and rank senior in right of payment to our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes; equal in right of payment to our indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively subordinated in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally subordinated to indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries.\nThe Notes are convertible into, at our election, cash, shares of common stock, or a combination of both, subject to satisfaction of specified conditions and during specified periods, as described below. If converted, we currently intend to pay cash in respect of the principal amount.\nThe conversion price of the Notes at any time is equal to $1,000 divided by the then-applicable conversion rate. The Notes have an initial conversion rate of 15.5129 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which represents an initial effective conversion price of approximately $64.46 per share of common stock and would result in the issuance of approximately 6,205,000 shares if all of the Notes were converted. Throughout the term of the Notes, the conversion rate may be adjusted upon the occurrence of certain events.\nHolders may surrender their Notes for conversion at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding December 1, 2020, only under the following circumstances:\n \u2022 during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on September 30, 2014, if the closing sale price of our common stock, for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) in the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is more than 130% of the conversion price of the Notes in effect on each applicable trading day; \n \u2022 during the ten consecutive trading-day period following any five consecutive trading-day period in which the trading price for the Notes for each such trading day was less than 98% of the closing sale price of our common stock on such date multiplied by the then-current conversion rate; or \n \u2022 upon the occurrence of specified corporate events, as described in the indenture governing the Notes, such as a consolidation, merger, or binding share exchange. \nOn or after December 1, 2020 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the\nmaturity date, holders may surrender their Notes for conversion regardless of whether any of the foregoing conditions have been satisfied.\nIf we satisfy our conversion obligation in solely cash or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, the amount of cash and shares of common stock, if any, due upon conversion will be based on a daily conversion value for each trading day in a 50 trading-day conversion period. Holders will not receive any additional cash payment or additional shares of common stock representing accrued and unpaid interest, if any, upon conversion of a Note, except in limited circumstances. Instead, interest will be deemed to be paid by the consideration delivered upon conversion of a Note.\nThe conversion rate for the Notes is subject to adjustment as described in the indenture governing the Notes. An adjustment to the conversion rate will result in a corresponding (but inverse) adjustment to the conversion price.\nIf specified make-whole adjustment events\u201d occur, the conversion rate for any Notes converted in connection with such make-whole adjustment event will, in specified circumstances, be increased by a number of additional shares of common stock. In addition, holders may require us to purchase for cash all or any portion of their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change\u201d at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change purchase date.\nAs of January 31, 2016, the Notes were not convertible.\nNote Hedges and Warrants\nConcurrently with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions (the Note Hedges\u201d) and sold warrants (the Warrants\u201d). The combination of the Note Hedges and the Warrants serves to increase the effective initial conversion price for the Notes to $75.00 per share. The Note Hedges and Warrants are each separate instruments from the Notes.\nNote Hedges\nPursuant to the Note Hedges, we purchased call options on our common stock, under which we have the right to acquire from the counterparties up to approximately 6,205,000 shares of our common stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, at a price of $64.46, which equals the initial conversion price of the Notes. Our exercise rights under the Note Hedges generally trigger upon conversion of the Notes and the Note Hedges terminate upon maturity of the Notes, or the first day the Notes are no longer outstanding. The Note Hedges may be settled in cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination thereof, at our option, and are intended to reduce our exposure to potential dilution upon conversion of the Notes. We paid $60.8 million for the Note Hedges, which was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital. As of January 31, 2016, we had not purchased any shares under the Note Hedges.\nWarrants\nWe sold the Warrants to several counterparties. The Warrants provide the counterparties rights to acquire from us up to approximately 6,205,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $75.00 per share. The Warrants expire incrementally on a series of expiration dates beginning in August 2021. At expiration, if the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the Warrants, we will be obligated to issue shares of our common stock having a value equal to such excess. The proceeds from the sale of the Warrants were $45.2 million and were recorded as additional paid-in capital. As of January 31, 2016, no Warrants had been exercised and all Warrants remained outstanding.\nCredit Agreement\nIn April 2011, we entered into a credit agreement with our lenders, which was amended and restated on March 6, 2013, and further amended on February 3, 2014, March 7, 2014, and June 18, 2014 (the \"Credit Agreement\"). The Credit Agreement, as amended and restated, provides for senior secured credit facilities, comprised of $943.5 million of term loans, of which $300.0 million was borrowed in February 2014 (the \"February 2014 Term Loans\") and of which $643.5 million was borrowed in March 2014 (the \"March 2014 Term Loans\"), all of which mature in September 2019, and a $300.0 million revolving credit facility maturing in September 2018, subject to increase and reduction from time to time, as described in the Credit Agreement.\nOn June 18, 2014, we utilized the majority of the combined net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes and the concurrent\nissuance of 5,750,000 shares of common stock to retire $530.0 million of the February 2014 Term Loans and March 2014 Term\nLoans. At January 31, 2016 and 2015, $411.1 million of combined borrowings were outstanding under the February 2014 Term Loans and March 2014 Term Loans, currently bearing interest at an annual rate of 3.50%, and there were no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\nOn February 11, 2016, we executed a pay-fixed, receive-variable interest rate swap with a multinational financial institution to partially mitigate risks associated with the variable interest rate on our term loans under which we will pay interest at a fixed rate of 4.143% and receive variable interest of three-month LIBOR (subject to a minimum of 0.75%), plus a spread of 2.75%, on a notional amount of $200.0 million. The effective date of the agreement is November 1, 2016, and settlements with the counterparty will occur on a quarterly basis, beginning on February 1, 2017. The agreement will terminate on September 6,\n2019. Assuming that we elect three-month LIBOR at the term loans' interest rate reset dates, beginning on November 1, 2016 and throughout the term of the interest rate swap agreement, the annual interest rate on $200.0 million of our term loans will be fixed at 4.143% during that period.\nFollowing the partial retirements of the February 2014 Term Loans and March 2014 Term Loans in June 2014 described above, there are no scheduled principal payments on the term loans until August 2016. The vast majority of the term loan balances are due upon maturity in September 2019.\nThe revolving credit facility contains a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (each as defined in the Credit Agreement) of no greater than 5.00 to 1 until January 31, 2016 and no greater than 4.50 to 1 thereafter (the \"Leverage Ratio Covenant\"). At January 31, 2016, our consolidated leverage ratio was approximately 2.5 to 1 compared to a permitted consolidated leverage ratio of 5.00 to 1, and our EBITDA for the twelve-month period then ended exceeded by at least $120.0 million the minimum EBITDA required to satisfy the Leverage Ratio Covenant given our outstanding debt as of such date.\nContractual Obligations\nAt January 31, 2016, our contractual obligations were as follows:\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>< 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>> 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt obligations, including interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>899,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>424,622\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>403,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>139,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,846\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63,959\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,776\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long-term obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>676\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>248\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>240\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,085,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69,728\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>96,974\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>451,562\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>467,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe long-term debt obligations reflected above include projected interest payments over the term of our outstanding debt as of January 31, 2016, assuming interest rates in effect for our term loan borrowings as of January 31, 2016.\nOperating lease obligations reflected above exclude future sublease income from certain space we have subleased to third parties. As of January 31, 2016, total expected future sublease income was $1.0 million and will range from $0.1 million to $0.8 million on an annual basis through August 2018.\nDuring the year ended January 31, 2016, we entered into a new operating lease for a facility in Herzliya, Israel, whose lease term commenced on February 1, 2016. The aggregate minimum lease commitment over the 12-year term of this new lease, excluding operating expenses, is approximately $40.6 million. This operating lease commitment is reflected in the table above.\nOur purchase obligations are associated with agreements for purchases of goods or services generally including agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transactions. Agreements to purchase goods or services that have cancellation provisions with no penalties are excluded from these purchase obligations.\nOur consolidated balance sheet at January 31, 2016 included $25.3 million of non-current tax reserves, net of related benefits (including interest and penalties of $3.3 million) for uncertain tax positions. However, these amounts are not included in the table above because it is not possible to predict or estimate the timing of payments for these obligations. We do not expect to make any significant payments for these uncertain tax positions within the next 12 months.\nContingent Payments Associated with Business Combinations\nIn connection with certain of our business combinations, we have agreed to make contingent cash payments to the former owners of the acquired companies based upon achievement of performance targets following the acquisition dates.\nFor the year ended January 31, 2016, we made $7.4 million of payments under contingent consideration arrangements. As of January 31, 2016, potential future cash payments and earned consideration expected to be paid subsequent to January 31, 2016 under contingent consideration arrangements total $51.7 million, the estimated fair value of which was $22.4 million, including $4.0 million reported in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and $18.4 million reported in other liabilities. The performance periods associated with these potential payments extend through April 2020.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of January 31, 2016, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that we believe have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted\nIn April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, and in August 2015 issued ASU No. 2015-15, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements. ASU No. 2015-03 changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements by requiring an entity to present such costs on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. ASU No. 2015-15 provides clarification regarding costs to secure revolving lines of credit, and indicates that the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements as an asset and subsequently amortizing them ratably over the term of the revolving debt arrangement. We elected to early adopt ASU No. 2015-03 as of January 31, 2016, and retrospectively reclassified $10.5 million of debt issuance costs associated with our long-term debt as of January 31, 2015 from other non-current assets to long-term debt. $3.1 million of net deferred debt issuance costs related to our revolving credit facility continue to be reported within other assets on our consolidated balance sheet at January 31, 2016.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes. The amendments in this update require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as long-term on the balance sheet. We have elected to early adopt ASU 2015-17 as of January 31, 2016 on a prospective basis. The January 31, 2015 consolidated balance sheet was not adjusted.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which will require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. Consistent with current GAAP, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease. However, unlike current GAAP, which requires only capital leases to be recognized on the balance sheet, the new guidance will require both types of leases to be recognized on the balance sheet. The new guidance is effective for all periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and we are currently evaluating the effects that the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements, but anticipate that the new guidance will significantly impact our consolidated financial statements given our significant number of leases.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASU No. 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific revenue recognition guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Accounting Standards Codification. Additionally, this update supersedes some cost guidance included in Subtopic 605-35, Revenue Recognition-Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. As originally issued, this guidance was effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption was not permitted. In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date by one year, to interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, but not before the original effective date of December 15, 2016. Entities may choose from two adoption methods, with certain practical expedients. We are currently reviewing this standard to assess the impact on our future consolidated financial statements and evaluating the available adoption methods.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with \"Business\" under Item 1, \"Selected Financial Data\" under Item 6, and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included under Item 8 of this report. This discussion contains a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on our current expectations and all of which could be affected by uncertainties and risks. Our actual results may differ materially from the results contemplated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors including, but not limited to, those described in \"Risk Factors\" under Item 1A of this report.\nOverview\nOur Business\nVerint is a global leader in Actionable Intelligence solutions. Actionable Intelligence is a necessity in a dynamic world of massive information growth because it empowers organizations with crucial insights and enables decision makers to anticipate, respond, and take action. With Verint solutions and value-added services, organizations of all sizes and across many industries can make more timely and effective decisions. Today, more than 10,000 organizations in 180 countries, including over 80 percent of the Fortune 100, use Verint solutions to improve enterprise performance and make the world a safer place. Verint's vision is to create A Smarter World with Actionable Intelligence.\nOur Actionable Intelligence solutions help organizations address three important challenges: Customer Engagement Optimization; Security Intelligence; and Fraud, Risk, and Compliance. We help our customers capture large amounts of information from numerous data types and sources, use analytics to glean insights from the information, and leverage the resulting Actionable Intelligence to help achieve their customer engagement, enhanced security, and risk mitigation goals.\nHeadquartered in Melville, New York, we support our customers around the globe directly and with an extensive network of selling and support partners.\nWe conduct our business through three operating segments-Enterprise Intelligence, Cyber Intelligence, and Video Intelligence. Organizing our business through three operating segments allows us to align our resources and domain expertise to more effectively address the Actionable Intelligence market. We address the Customer Engagement Optimization market opportunity through solutions from our Enterprise Intelligence segment. We address the Security Intelligence market\nopportunity through solutions from our Cyber Intelligence segment and Video Intelligence segment, and we address the Fraud, Risk, and Compliance market opportunity through solutions from all three operating segments.\nFor the years ended January 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, our Enterprise Intelligence segment represented approximately 55%, 58%, and 55% of our total revenue, respectively. For the years ended January 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, our Cyber Intelligence segment represented approximately 34%, 32%, and 32% of our total revenue, respectively. For the years ended January 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, our Video Intelligence segment represented approximately 11%, 10%, and 13% of our total revenue, respectively.\nGenerally, we make business decisions by evaluating the risks and rewards of the opportunities available to us in the markets served by each of our segments. We view each operating segment differently and allocate capital, personnel, resources, and management attention accordingly. In reviewing each operating segment, we also review the performance of that segment by geography. Our marketing and sales strategies, expansion opportunities, and product offerings may differ materially within a particular segment geographically, as may our allocation of resources between segments. When making decisions regarding investment in our business, increasing capital expenditures, or making other decisions that may reduce our profitability, we also consider the leverage ratio in our revolving credit facility. See \"- Liquidity and Capital Resources\" for more information.\nKey Trends and Factors That May Impact our Performance\nWe believe that there are many factors that affect our ability to sustain and increase both revenue and profitability, including:\n \u2022 Market acceptance of Actionable Intelligence solutions. We compete in markets where the value of aspects of our products and solutions is still in the process of market acceptance. Our future growth depends in part on the continued and increasing acceptance and realization of the value of our product offerings. However, we believe that organizations in both the enterprise and security markets want and need Actionable Intelligence solutions to help achieve their customer engagement, enhanced security, and risk mitigation goals. \n \u2022 Evolving technologies and market potential. Our success depends in part on our ability to keep pace with technological changes, customer challenges, and evolving industry standards in our product offerings, successfully developing, launching, and driving demand for new, innovative, high-quality products and services that meet or exceed customer needs, and identifying, entering, and prioritizing areas of growing market potential. For example, in our Security Intelligence business, stronger and more frequent use of encryption has created significantly greater challenges for our customers and for our solutions to address. In the enterprise market, we believe that today's customer-centric organizations are increasingly seeking Customer Engagement Optimization solutions that allow them to collect and analyze intelligence across different service channels to gain a better understanding of the performance of their workforce, the effectiveness of their service processes, the quality of their interactions, and changing customer behaviors, as well as to anticipate and prevent information security breaches, effectively authenticate customers, protect personal information, mitigate risk, prevent fraud, and help ensure compliance with evolving legal, regulatory, and internal requirements. In the security market, we believe that terrorism, criminal activities, cyber-attacks, and other security threats, combined with new and more complex security challenges, including increasingly frequent and sophisticated cyber-attacks and increasingly complex and secure communication networks, are driving demand for Actionable Intelligence solutions to help anticipate, prepare, and respond to these threats. \n \u2022 Information technology and government spending. Our growth and results depend in part on general economic conditions and the pace of information technology spending by both commercial and governmental customers. In the year ended January 31, 2016, we experienced extended sales cycles, particularly for large projects, a reduction in deal sizes, and pressure on maintenance renewals for our Enterprise Intelligence solutions. This trend regarding extended sales cycles and reduced deal sizes was particularly acute for our Security Intelligence business which has significant exposure to emerging markets where budgets have been reduced significantly due to weak economic conditions and currency devaluations. \nSee Item 1 of this report for more information on key trends that we believe are driving demand for our solutions and \"Risk Factors\" under Item 1A of this report for a more complete description of risks that may impact future revenue and profitability.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nAn appreciation of our critical accounting policies is necessary to understand our financial results. The accounting policies outlined below are considered to be critical because they can materially affect our operating results and financial condition, as these policies may require us to make difficult and subjective judgments regarding uncertainties. The accuracy of these estimates and the likelihood of future changes depend on a range of possible outcomes and a number of underlying variables, many of which are beyond our control, and there can be no assurance that our estimates are accurate.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue recognition policy is a critical component of determining our operating results and is based on a complex set of accounting rules that require us to make significant judgments and estimates. We derive and report our revenue in two categories: (a) product revenue, including sale of hardware products (which include software that works together with the hardware to deliver the product's essential functionality) and licensing of software products, and (b) service and support revenue, including revenue from installation services, post-contract customer support (\"PCS\"), project management, hosting services, SaaS, application managed services, product warranties, business advisory consulting and training services. Our customer arrangements may include any combination of these elements. We follow the appropriate revenue recognition rules for each of these revenue streams. For additional information, see Note 1, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this report. Revenue recognition for a particular arrangement is dependent upon such factors as the level of customization within the solution and the contractual delivery, acceptance, payment, and support terms with the customer. Significant judgment is required to conclude on each of these factors, and if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments, it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period.\nWe generally consider a purchase order or executed sales quote, when combined with a master license agreement, to constitute evidence of an arrangement. Delivery occurs when the product is shipped or transmitted and title and risk of loss have transferred to the customers. Our typical customer arrangements do not include substantive product acceptance provisions; however, if such provisions are provided, delivery is deemed to occur upon acceptance. We consider the fee to be fixed or determinable unless the fee is subject to refund or adjustment or is not payable within our standard payment terms. If the fee due from a customer is not fixed or determinable due to extended payment terms, revenue is recognized when payment becomes due or upon cash receipt, whichever is earlier.\nOur multiple-element arrangements consist of a combination of our product and service offerings that may be delivered at various points in time. For arrangements within the scope of the multiple-deliverable guidance, a deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has stand-alone value and there are no customer-negotiated refunds or return rights for the delivered elements. For multiple-element arrangements comprised only of tangible products containing software components and non-software components and related services, we allocate revenue to each element in an arrangement based on a selling price hierarchy. The selling price for a deliverable is based on its vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE\u201d), if available, third-party evidence ( TPE\u201d), if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price ( ESP\u201d), if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. The total transaction revenue is allocated to the multiple elements based on each element's relative selling price compared to the total selling price.\nWe account for multiple-element arrangements that contain only software and software-related elements by allocating a portion of the total purchase price to the undelivered elements, primarily installation services, PCS, consulting, and training, using VSOE of fair value of the undelivered elements. The remaining portion of the total transaction value is allocated to the delivered software, referred to as the residual method. If we are unable to establish VSOE for the undelivered elements of the arrangement, revenue recognition is deferred for the entire arrangement until all elements of the arrangement are delivered. However, if the only undelivered element is PCS, we recognize the arrangement fee ratably over the PCS period.\nFor multiple-element arrangements that are comprised of a combination of hardware and software elements, the total transaction value is bifurcated between the hardware elements and the software elements that are not essential to the functionality of the hardware, based on the relative selling prices of the hardware elements and the software elements as a group. Revenue is then recognized for the hardware and hardware-related services following the hardware revenue recognition methodology outlined above and revenue for the software and software-related services is recognized following the residual method or ratably over the PCS period if VSOE for PCS does not exist.\nOur policy for establishing VSOE for installation, business advisory consulting, and training is based upon an analysis of separate sales of services. We utilize either the substantive renewal rate approach or the bell-shaped curve approach to establish VSOE for our PCS offerings, depending upon the business segment, geographical region, or product line. The timing of revenue recognition on software licenses and other revenue could be significantly impacted if we are unable to maintain VSOE on one or more undelivered elements during any quarterly period. Loss of VSOE could result in (i) the complete deferral of all\nrevenue or (ii) ratable recognition of all revenue under a customer arrangement until such time as VSOE is re-established. If we are unable to re-establish VSOE on one or more undelivered elements for an extended period of time it would impact our ability to accurately forecast the timing of quarterly revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe typically are not able to determine TPE for our products or our service and support offerings. TPE of selling price is established by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in stand-alone sales to similarly situated customers.\nIf we are unable to determine the selling price because VSOE or TPE does not exist, we determine ESP for the purposes of allocating the arrangement by considering several external and internal factors including, but not limited to, pricing practices, similar product offerings, margin objectives, geographies in which we offer our products and services, internal costs, competition, and product lifecycle. The determination of ESP is made through consultation with and approval by our management, taking into consideration our go-to-market strategies. We have established processes to update ESP for each element, when appropriate, to ensure that it reflects recent pricing experience.\nPCS revenue is derived from providing technical software support services and unspecified software updates and upgrades to customers on a when-and-if-available basis. PCS revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance period which, in most cases, is one year. When PCS is included within a multiple-element arrangement, we utilize either the substantive renewal rate approach or the bell-shaped curve approach to establish VSOE of the PCS, depending upon the business operating segment, geographical region, or product line.\nUnder the substantive renewal rate approach, we believe it is necessary to evaluate whether both the support renewal rate and term are substantive, and whether the renewal rate is being consistently applied to subsequent renewals for a particular customer. We establish VSOE under this approach through analyzing the renewal rate stated in the customer agreement and determining whether that rate is above the minimum substantive VSOE renewal rate established for that particular PCS offering. The minimum substantive VSOE rate is determined based upon an analysis of renewal rates associated with historical PCS contracts. Typically, renewal rates of 15% for PCS plans that provide when-and-if-available upgrades, and 10% for plans that do not provide for when-and-if-available upgrades, would be deemed to be minimum substantive renewal rates. For contracts that do not contain a stated renewal rate, revenue associated with the entire bundled arrangement is recognized ratably over the PCS term. Contracts that have a renewal rate below the minimum substantive VSOE rate are deemed to contain a more than insignificant discount element, for which VSOE cannot be established. We recognize revenue for these arrangements over the period that the customer is entitled to renew their PCS at the discounted rate, but not to exceed the estimated economic life of the product.\nUnder the bell-shaped curve approach of establishing VSOE, we perform a VSOE compliance test to ensure that a substantial majority (75% or over) of our actual PCS renewals are within a narrow range of plus or minus 15% of the median pricing.\nSome of our arrangements require significant customization of the product to meet the particular requirements of the customer. For these arrangements, revenue is recognized under contract accounting methods, typically using the percentage of completion (\"POC\") method. Under the POC method, revenue recognition is generally based upon the ratio of hours incurred to date to the total estimated hours required to complete the contract. Profit estimates on long-term contracts are revised periodically based on changes in circumstances, and any losses on contracts are recognized in the period that such losses become evident. Generally, the terms of long-term contracts provide for progress billings based on completion of milestones or other defined phases of work. Significant judgment is often required when estimating total hours and progress to completion on these arrangements, as well as whether a loss is expected to be incurred on the contract due to several factors including the degree of customization required and the customer's existing environment. We use historical experience, project plans, and an assessment of the risks and uncertainties inherent in the arrangement to establish these estimates. Uncertainties in these arrangements include implementation delays or performance issues that may or may not be within our control.\nOur SaaS offerings generally provide customers access to certain of our software within a cloud-based information technology environment that we manage and offer to customers on a subscription basis. We recognize revenue for subscription and related support services over the contract period originating when the subscription service is made available to the customer and the contractual hosting period has commenced.\nOur application managed services revenue is derived from providing services that enhance our customers IT processes and maximize the business benefits of our solutions. Application managed services revenue is recognized ratably over the applicable term which, in most cases, is at least one year. When application managed services is included within a multiple-\nelement arrangement, we utilize the substantive renewal rate approach to establish VSOE. In addition, we perform a budget versus actual time analysis to support our initial estimate of effort required to provide these services.\nWe extend customary trade payment terms to our customers in the normal course of conducting business. To assess the probability of collection for purposes of revenue recognition, we have established credit policies that establish prudent credit limits for our customers. These credit limits are based upon our risk assessment of the customer's ability to pay, their payment history, geographic risk, and other factors, and are not contingent upon the resale of the product or upon the collection of payments from their customers. These credit limits are reviewed and revised periodically on the basis of updated customer financial statement information, payment performance, and other factors. When a customer is not deemed creditworthy, revenue is recognized when payment is received.\nWe record provisions for estimated product returns in the same period in which the associated revenue is recognized. We base these estimates of product returns upon historical levels of sales returns and other known factors. Actual product returns could be different from our estimates and current or future provisions for product returns may differ from historical provisions. Concessions granted to customers are recorded as reductions to revenue in the period in which they were granted and have been minimal in both amount and frequency.\nProduct revenue derived from shipments to resellers and OEMs who purchase our products for resale are generally recognized when such products are shipped (on a \"sell-in\" basis) since we do not expect our resellers or OEMs to carry inventory of our products. This policy is predicated on our ability to estimate sales returns as well as other criteria regarding these customers. We are also required to evaluate whether our resellers and OEMs have the ability to honor their commitment to make fixed or determinable payments regardless of whether they collect payment from their customers. In this regard, we assess whether our resellers and OEMs are new, poorly capitalized, or experiencing financial difficulty, and whether they have a pattern of not paying as amounts become due on previous arrangements or seeking payment terms longer than those provided to end customers. If we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments, it could cause a material change to the revenue reported in a particular period. We have historically experienced insignificant product returns from resellers and OEMs, and our payment terms for these customers are similar to those granted to our end-users. Our policy also presumes that we have no significant performance obligations in connection with the sale of our products by our resellers and OEMs to their customers. If a reseller or OEM develops a pattern of payment delinquency, or seeks payment terms longer than generally granted to our resellers or OEMs, we defer the recognition of revenue from transactions with that reseller or OEM until the receipt of cash.\nMultiple contracts with a single counterparty executed within close proximity of each other are evaluated to determine if the contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single arrangement. We record reimbursements from customers for out-of-pocket expenses as revenue. Shipping and handling fees and expenses that are billed to customers are recognized in revenue and the costs associated with such fees and expenses are recorded in cost of revenue. Historically, these fees and expenses have not been material. Taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities are excluded from revenue.\nFor multiple-element arrangements that contain software and software related elements for which we are unable to establish VSOE of one or more elements, we use various available indicators of fair value and apply our best judgment to reasonably classify the arrangement's revenue into product revenue and service revenue for financial reporting purposes.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe estimate the collectability of our accounts receivable balances each accounting period and adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts accordingly. We exercise a considerable amount of judgment in assessing the collectability of accounts receivable, including consideration of the creditworthiness of each customer, their collection history, and the related aging of past due accounts receivable balances. We evaluate specific accounts when we learn that a customer may be experiencing a deterioration of its financial condition due to lower credit ratings, bankruptcy, or other factors that may affect its ability to render payment.\nAccounting for Business Combinations\nWe allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired, including in-process research and development assets, and liabilities assumed, based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. These fair values are typically estimated with assistance from independent valuation specialists. The purchase price allocation process requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets, contractual support obligations assumed, and pre-acquisition contingencies.\nAlthough we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain.\nExamples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to:\n \u2022 future expected cash flows from software license sales, support agreements, consulting contracts, other customer contracts, and acquired developed technologies; \n \u2022 expected costs to develop in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed; \n \u2022 the acquired company's brand and competitive position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company's product portfolio; \n \u2022 cost of capital and discount rates; and \n \u2022 estimating the useful lives of acquired assets as well as the pattern or manner in which the assets will amortize. \nIn connection with the purchase price allocations for applicable acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of the contractual support obligations we are assuming from the acquired business. The estimated fair value of the support obligations is determined utilizing a cost build-up approach, which determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a reasonable profit margin. The estimated costs to fulfill the support obligations are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the support services. The sum of these costs and operating profit represents an approximation of the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the support obligations.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nWe test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which can be an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, on an annual basis as of November 1, or more frequently if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that impairment in the value of goodwill may exist. As of January 31, 2016, our reporting units are consistent with our operating segments identified in Note 17, \"Segment, Geographic, and Significant Customer Information\" to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this report.\nWe review goodwill for impairment utilizing either a qualitative assessment or a two-step process. If we decide that it is appropriate to perform a qualitative assessment and conclude that the fair value of a reporting unit more likely than not exceeds its carrying value, no further evaluation is necessary. For reporting units where we perform the two-step process, the first step requires us to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit and compare that fair value to the respective carrying value, which includes goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill is not considered impaired and no further evaluation is necessary. If the carrying value is higher than the estimated fair value, there is an indication that impairment may exist and the second step is required. In the second step, the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated as the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the fair values assigned to its assets and liabilities. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill, the difference is recognized as an impairment charge.\nFor reporting units where we decide to perform a qualitative assessment, we assess and make judgments regarding a variety of factors which potentially impact the fair value of a reporting unit, including general economic conditions, industry and market-specific conditions, customer behavior, cost factors, our financial performance and trends, our strategies and business plans, capital requirements, management and personnel issues, and our stock price, among others. We then consider the totality of these and other factors, placing more weight on the events and circumstances that are judged to most affect a reporting unit's fair value or the carrying amount of its net assets, to reach a qualitative conclusion regarding whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount.\nFor reporting units where we perform the two-step process, we utilize some or all of three primary approaches to assess fair value: (a) an income-based approach, using projected discounted cash flows, (b) a market-based approach, using multiples of comparable companies, and (c) a transaction-based approach, using multiples for recent acquisitions of similar businesses made in the marketplace.\nOur estimate of fair value of each reporting unit is based on a number of subjective factors, including: (a) appropriate consideration of valuation approaches (income approach, comparable public company approach, and comparable transaction approach), (b) estimates of future growth rates, (c) estimates of our future cost structure, (d) discount rates for our estimated\ncash flows, (e) selection of peer group companies for the comparable public company and the comparable transaction approaches, (f) required levels of working capital, (g) assumed terminal value, and (h) time horizon of cash flow forecasts.\nThe determination of reporting units also requires judgment. We assess whether a reporting unit exists within a reportable segment by identifying the unit, determining whether the unit qualifies as a business under GAAP, and assessing the availability and regular review by segment management of discrete financial information for the unit.\nWe review intangible assets that have finite useful lives and other long-lived assets when an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment. If any indicators are present, we perform a recoverability test by comparing the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets in question to their carrying amounts. If the undiscounted cash flows used in the test for recoverability are less than the long-lived assets carrying amount, we determine the fair value of the long-lived asset and recognize an impairment loss if the carrying amount of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. The impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.\nFor all of our goodwill and other intangible asset impairment reviews, the assumptions and estimates used in the process are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts. Although we believe the assumptions, judgments, and estimates we have used in our assessments are reasonable and appropriate, a material change in any of our assumptions or external factors could lead to future goodwill or other intangible asset impairment charges.\nBased upon our November 1, 2015 goodwill impairment reviews, we concluded that the estimated fair values of our Enterprise Intelligence, Cyber Intelligence, and Video Intelligence reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying values.\nOur Enterprise Intelligence, Cyber Intelligence, and Video Intelligence reporting units carried goodwill of $1.0 billion, $120.7 million, and $37.5 million, respectively, at January 31, 2016.\nWe did not record any impairments of goodwill for the years ended January 31, 2016, 2015, or 2014.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method which includes the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in our consolidated financial statements. Under this approach, deferred taxes are recorded for the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. The provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus deferred taxes. Deferred taxes result from differences between the financial statement and tax bases of our assets and liabilities, and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. The effects of future changes in income tax laws or rates are not anticipated.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The calculation of our tax provision involves the application of complex tax laws and requires significant judgment and estimates.\nWe evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets for each jurisdiction in which we operate at each reporting date, and we establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income of the same character and in the same jurisdiction. We consider all available positive and negative evidence in making this assessment, including, but not limited to, the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. In circumstances where there is sufficient negative evidence indicating that our deferred tax assets are not more likely than not realizable, we establish a valuation allowance.\nWe use a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by assessing whether they are more likely than not sustainable, based solely on their technical merits, upon examination, and including resolution of any related appeals or litigation process. The second step is to measure the associated tax benefit of each position as the largest amount that we believe is more likely than not realizable. Differences between the amount of tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in our income tax returns and the amount of tax benefits recognized in our financial statements represent our unrecognized income tax benefits, which we either record as a liability or as a reduction of deferred tax assets. Our policy is to include interest (expense and/or income) and penalties related to unrecognized income tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes.\nContingencies\nWe recognize an estimated loss from a claim or loss contingency when and if information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Accounting for claims and contingencies requires the use of significant judgment and estimates. One notable potential source of loss contingencies is pending or threatened litigation. Legal counsel and other advisors and experts are consulted on issues related to litigation as well as on matters related to contingencies occurring in the ordinary course of business.\nAccounting for Stock-Based Compensation\nWe recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award.\nDuring the three-year period ended January 31, 2016, restricted stock units were our predominant stock-based payment award. The fair value of these awards is equivalent to the market value of our common stock on the grant date. In the past, we have also awarded stock options, the fair value of which is estimated on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for this purpose, which requires the input of significant assumptions including an estimate of the average period of time employees will retain stock options before exercising them, the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term, the number of options that will ultimately be forfeited before completing vesting requirements, and the risk-free interest rate.\nWe periodically award restricted stock units that vest upon the achievement of specified performance goals. Our estimate of the fair value of these performance-based awards requires an assessment of the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved. At each reporting date, we update our assessment of the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved and adjust our estimate of the fair value of the award, if necessary.\nChanges in assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock-based compensation and, consequently, the related expense recognized. The assumptions we use in calculating the fair value of stock-based payment awards represent our best estimates, which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\nCost of Revenue\nWe have made an accounting policy election whereby certain costs of product revenue, including hardware and third-party software license fees, are capitalized and amortized over the same period that product revenue is recognized, while installation and other service costs are generally expensed as incurred, except for certain contracts recognized according to contract accounting.\nFor example, in a multiple-element arrangement where revenue is recognized over the PCS support period, the cost of revenue associated with the product is capitalized upon product delivery and amortized over that same period. However, the cost of revenue associated with the services is expensed as incurred in the period in which the services are performed. In addition, we expense customer acquisition and origination costs to selling, general and administrative expense, including sales commissions, as incurred, with the exception of certain sales referral fees in our Cyber Intelligence segment which are capitalized and amortized ratably over the revenue recognition period.\nResults of Operations\nSeasonality and Cyclicality\nAs is typical for many software and technology companies, our business is subject to seasonal and cyclical factors. In most years, our revenue and operating income are typically highest in the fourth quarter and lowest in the first quarter (prior to the impact of unusual or nonrecurring items). Moreover, revenue and operating income in the first quarter of a new year may be lower than in the fourth quarter of the preceding year, in some years, by a significant margin. In addition, we generally receive a higher volume of orders in the last month of a quarter, with orders concentrated in the later part of that month. We believe that these seasonal and cyclical factors primarily reflect customer spending patterns and budget cycles, as well as the impact of incentive compensation plans for our sales personnel. While seasonal and cyclical factors such as these are common in the software and technology industry, this pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future revenue or financial performance. Many other factors, including general economic conditions, may also have an impact on our business and financial results.\nOverview of Operating Results\nThe following table sets forth a summary of certain key financial information for the years ended January 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014: \nYear Ended January 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2015. Our revenue increased approximately $1.9 million to $1,130.3 million in the year ended January 31, 2016 from $1,128.4 million in the year ended January 31, 2015. The increase consisted of a $34.1 million increase in service and support revenue, offset by a $32.2 million decrease in product revenue. In our Cyber Intelligence segment, revenue increased approximately $26.0 million, or 7%, from $359.4 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 to $385.4 million in the year ended January 31, 2016. The increase consisted of a $31.0 million increase in service and support revenue and a $5.0 million decrease in product revenue. In our Video Intelligence segment, revenue increased approximately $8.5 million, or 8%, from $110.4 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 to $118.9 million in the year ended January 31, 2016, primarily due to an increase in product revenue. In our Enterprise Intelligence segment, revenue decreased approximately $32.8 million, or 5%, to $625.9 million in the year ended January 31, 2016 from $658.7 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 due to a decrease in product revenue. For additional details on our revenue by segment, see \"-Revenue by Operating Segment\". Revenue in the Americas, EMEA, and APAC represented approximately 51%, 31%, and 18% of our total revenue, respectively, in the year ended January 31, 2016, compared to approximately 52%, 31%, and 17%, respectively, in the year ended January 31, 2015. Further details of changes in revenue are provided below.\nOperating income was $67.9 million in the year ended January 31, 2016 compared to $79.1 million in the year ended January 31, 2015. This decrease in operating income was primarily due to an $11.9 million decrease in gross profit primarily due to decreased gross profit in our Enterprise Intelligence segment and a $0.7 million decrease in operating expenses, which consisted of a $4.0 million increase in net research and development expenses, offset by a $2.6 million decrease in selling, general and administrative expense and a $2.1 million decrease in amortization of other acquired intangible assets. Further details of changes in operating income are provided below.\nNet income attributable to Verint Systems Inc. common shares was $17.6 million, and diluted net income per common share was $0.28, in the year ended January 31, 2016 compared to net income attributable to Verint Systems Inc. common shares of $30.9 million, and diluted net income per common share of $0.52, in the year ended January 31, 2015. The decrease in net income attributable to Verint Systems Inc. and diluted net income per common share in the year ended January 31, 2016 was primarily due to a $16.0 million decrease in our benefit for income taxes, from a benefit of $15.0 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 to an expense of $1.0 million in the year ended January 31, 2016, and decreased operating income, as described above. These decreases to net income attributable to Verint Systems Inc. common shares were partially offset by a $13.0 million decrease in other expense, net, primarily due to losses upon early retirement of debt recorded during the year ended January 31, 2015, with no comparable losses during the year ended January 31, 2016. Further details of changes in total other expense, net, are provided below.\nA portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and therefore our revenue and operating expenses are affected by fluctuations in applicable foreign currency exchange rates. When comparing average exchange rates for the year ended January 31, 2016 to average exchange rates for the year ended January 31, 2015, the U.S. dollar strengthened relative to the British pound sterling, euro, Israeli shekel (both hedged and unhedged), Australian dollar, Brazilian real, and Singapore dollar, resulting in an overall decrease in our revenue (primarily in our Enterprise Intelligence and Cyber Intelligence segments), cost of revenue, and operating expenses on a U.S. dollar-denominated basis. For the year ended January 31, 2016, had foreign exchange rates remained unchanged from rates in effect for the year ended January 31, 2015, our revenue would have been approximately $40.0 million higher and our cost of revenue and operating expenses on a combined basis would have been approximately $44.6 million higher, which would have resulted in a $4.6 million decrease in operating income.\nCurrently, we employ approximately 5,000 professionals, including part-time employees and certain contractors, as compared to approximately 4,800 at January 31, 2015.\nYear Ended January 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2014. Our revenue increased approximately $221.1 million, or 24%, to $1,128.4 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 from $907.3 million in the year ended January 31, 2014. In our Enterprise Intelligence segment, revenue increased approximately $159.8 million, or 32%, to $658.7 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 from $498.9 million in the year ended January 31, 2014. The increase consisted of a $132.9 million increase in service and support revenue and a $26.9 million increase in product revenue. In our Cyber Intelligence segment, revenue increased approximately $71.4 million, or 25%, from $288.0 million in the year ended January 31, 2014 to $359.4 million in the year ended January 31, 2015. The increase consisted of a $54.9 million increase in product revenue and a $16.5 million increase in service and support revenue. In our Video Intelligence segment, revenue decreased approximately $10.0 million, or 8%, from $120.4 million in the year ended January 31, 2014 to $110.4 million in the year ended January 31, 2015, primarily due to a decrease in product revenue. For additional details on our revenue by segment, see \"-Revenue by Operating Segment\". Revenue in the Americas, EMEA, and APAC represented approximately 52%, 31%, and 17% of our total revenue, respectively, in the year ended January 31, 2015, compared to approximately 56%, 20%, and 24%, respectively, in the year ended January 31, 2014. The change in the percentage of revenue by geographical region in the year ended January 31, 2015 compared to the year ended January 31, 2014 primarily reflected the timing of revenue recognized in those regions under several large contracts, primarily in our Cyber Intelligence segment. Further details of changes in revenue are provided below.\nOperating income was $79.1 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 compared to $122.3 million in the year ended January 31, 2014. This decrease in operating income was primarily due to a $155.6 million increase in operating expenses, from $478.6 million to $634.2 million, partially offset by a $112.4 million increase in gross profit from $600.9 million to $713.3 million. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to increased gross profit in our Enterprise Intelligence and Communication Intelligence segments. Despite the increase in gross profit, our overall gross margin decreased from 66% in the year ended January 31, 2014 to 63% in the year ended January 31, 2015 primarily due to a change in the mix of services attributable to a business combination in our Enterprise Intelligence segment that closed during the year ended January 31, 2015. The increase in operating expenses consisted of an $87.9 million increase in selling, general and administrative expense, a $47.2 million increase in net research and development expenses, and a $20.5 million increase in amortization of other acquired intangible assets. Further details of changes in operating income are provided below.\nNet income attributable to Verint Systems Inc. common shares was $30.9 million, and diluted net income per common share was $0.52, in the year ended January 31, 2015 compared to net income attributable to Verint Systems Inc. common shares of $53.6 million, and diluted net income per common share of $0.99, in the year ended January 31, 2014. The decrease in net income attributable to Verint Systems Inc. common shares and diluted net income per common share in the year ended January 31, 2015 was primarily due to our decreased operating income, as described above, a $6.9 million increase in interest expense, and a $2.6 million increase in losses upon early retirement of debt recorded during year ended January 31, 2015 compared to the year ended January 31, 2014. These decreases to net income attributable to Verint Systems Inc. common shares were partially offset by and a $19.5 million decrease in our (benefit) provision for income taxes and a $10.7 million decrease in other expense, net. During the year ended January 31, 2015, other expense, net, included net foreign currency losses of $13.4 million, partially offset by net gains on derivative instruments of $4.0 million. During the year ended January 31, 2014, other expense, net, included a charge of $12.9 million for the derecognition of an indemnification asset associated with the resolution of an uncertain tax position previously recorded in connection with the CTI Merger and net foreign currency losses of $6.1 million. Further details of changes in total other expense, net, are provided below.\nWhen comparing average exchange rates for the year ended January 31, 2015 to average exchange rates for the year ended January 31, 2014, while the U.S. dollar weakened relative to the British pound sterling and our hedged Israeli shekel rate, it strengthened relative to the euro, Australian dollar, Japanese yen, Brazilian real, and Singapore dollar, resulting in an overall decrease in our revenue and cost of revenue. For operating expenses, the impact of the weakened U.S. dollar relative to the British pound sterling and our hedged Israeli shekel rate was greater than the impact of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, Australian dollar, Japanese yen, Brazilian real, and Singapore dollar, resulting in an increase in operating expenses on a U.S. dollar-denominated basis. For the year ended January 31, 2015, had foreign exchange rates remained unchanged from rates in effect for the year ended January 31, 2014, our revenue would have been approximately $4.2 million higher and our cost of revenue and operating expenses on a combined basis would have been approximately $3.8 million lower, which would have resulted in a $8.0 million increase in operating income.\nAs of January 31, 2015, we employed approximately 4,800 employees, including part-time employees and certain contractors, as compared to approximately 3,400 at January 31, 2014. This increase was due to a combination of acquisitions and organic growth during the twelve months ended January 31, 2015.\nRevenue by Operating Segment\nThe following table sets forth revenue for each of our three operating segments for the years ended January 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014: \nEnterprise Intelligence Segment\nYear Ended January 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2015. Enterprise Intelligence revenue decreased approximately $32.8 million, or 5%, from $658.7 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 to $625.9 million in the year ended January 31, 2016. The decrease consisted of a $31.9 million decrease in product revenue and a $0.9 million decrease in service and support revenue. The decrease in product revenue primarily reflects a lower aggregate value of executed license arrangements, which comprises the majority of our product revenue and which can fluctuate from period to period. The decrease in service and support revenue was primarily due to a decrease in revenue from professional services and consulting projects in the year ended January 31, 2016, partially offset by an increase in support revenue. As mentioned above, our revenue during the year ended January 31, 2016 was also adversely affected by the impact of the strengthening of the U.S dollar relative to foreign locations currencies where we conduct business.\nYear Ended January 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2014. Enterprise Intelligence revenue increased approximately $159.8 million, or 32%, from $498.9 million in the year ended January 31, 2014 to $658.7 million in the year ended January 31, 2015. The increase consisted of a $132.9 million increase in service and support revenue and a $26.9 million increase in product revenue. The increase in service and support revenue was primarily due to an increase in our customer install base, both organically and through business combinations, and the related support revenue generated from this customer base during the year ended January 31, 2015, as well as increased revenue from new service offerings in the year ended January 31, 2015. The increase in product revenue was due to an increase in product sales to new customers during the year ended January 31, 2015. The growth of service revenue relative to product revenue was attributable to various factors, including an increase in services associated with customer product upgrades, a higher component of service offerings in our standard arrangements, and growth in our install base, both organically and as a result of business combinations, through the end of such period.\nCyber Intelligence Segment\nYear Ended January 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2015. Cyber Intelligence revenue increased approximately $26.0 million, or 7%, from $359.4 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 to $385.4 million in the year ended January 31, 2016. The increase consisted of a $31.0 million increase in service and support revenue, partially offset by a $5.0 million decrease in product revenue. The increase in service and support revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in progress realized during the current year on projects with revenue recognized using the percentage of completion (\"POC\") method, some of which commenced in the previous fiscal year, and an increase in support revenue from new and existing customers. The decrease in product revenue was primarily due to a decrease in product deliveries to customers, partially offset by an increase in progress realized during the current year on projects with revenue recognized using the POC method, some of which commenced in the previous fiscal year. As mentioned above, our revenue during the year ended January 31, 2016 was also adversely affected by the impact of the strengthening of the U.S dollar relative to the currencies used in the foreign locations where we conduct business.\nYear Ended January 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2014. Cyber Intelligence revenue increased approximately $71.4 million, or 25%, from $288.0 million in the year ended January 31, 2014 to $359.4 million in the year ended January 31, 2015. The increase consisted of a $54.9 million increase in product revenue and a $16.5 million increase in service and support revenue. The increase in product revenue was primarily due to an increase in product deliveries to customers and an increase in progress realized during the year ended January 31, 2015 on projects with revenue recognized using the POC method, some of which commenced in the previous fiscal year. The increase in service and support revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in progress realized during the year ended January 31, 2015 on projects with revenue recognized using the POC\nmethod, some of which commenced in the previous fiscal year, and an increase in revenue from software-as-a-service (\"SaaS\") offerings.\nVideo Intelligence Segment\nYear Ended January 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2015. Video Intelligence revenue increased approximately $8.5 million, or 8%, from $110.4 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 to $118.9 million in the year ended January 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in product deliveries to customers during the year ended January 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended January 31, 2015.\nYear Ended January 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2014. Video Intelligence revenue decreased approximately $10.0 million, or 8%, from $120.4 million in the year ended January 31, 2014 to $110.4 million in the year ended January 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in sales of certain hardware products to a single large customer during the year ended January 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended January 31, 2014.\nVolume and Price\nWe sell products in multiple configurations, and the price of any particular product varies depending on the configuration of the product sold. Due to the variety of customized configurations for each product we sell, we are unable to quantify the amount of any revenue increase attributable to a change in the price of any particular product and/or a change in the number of products sold.\nProduct Revenue and Service and Support Revenue\nWe derive and report our revenue in two categories: (a) product revenue, including licensing of software products and sale of hardware products (which include software that works together with the hardware to deliver the product's essential functionality), and (b) service and support revenue, including revenue from installation services, post-contract customer support, project management, hosting services, SaaS, application managed services, product warranties, and business advisory consulting and training services. For multiple-element arrangements for which we are unable to establish VSOE for one or more elements, we use various available indicators of fair value and apply our best judgment to reasonably classify the arrangement's revenue into product revenue and service and support revenue.\nThe following table sets forth product revenue and service and support revenue for the years ended January 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014:\n\nProduct Revenue\nYear Ended January 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2015. Product revenue decreased approximately $32.2 million, or 7%, from $487.6 million for the year ended January 31, 2015 to $455.4 million for the year ended January 31, 2016, resulting from a $31.9 million decrease in our Enterprise Intelligence segment and a $5.0 million decrease in our Cyber Intelligence segment, partially offset by a $4.7 million increase in our Video Intelligence segment.\nYear Ended January 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2014. Product revenue increased approximately $71.1 million, or 17%, from $416.5 million for the year ended January 31, 2014 to $487.6 million for the year ended January 31, 2015, resulting from a $54.9 million increase in our Cyber Intelligence segment and a $26.9 million increase in our Enterprise Intelligence segment, partially offset by a $10.7 million decrease in our Video Intelligence segment.\nFor additional information see \"-Revenue by Operating Segment\".\nService and Support Revenue\nYear Ended January 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2015. Service and support revenue increased approximately $34.1 million, or 5%, from $640.8 million for the year ended January 31, 2015 to $674.9 million for the year ended January 31, 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to increases of $31.0 million and $3.8 million in our Cyber Intelligence and Video Intelligence segments, respectively, partially offset by a $0.9 million decrease in our Enterprise Intelligence segment.\nYear Ended January 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2014. Service and support revenue increased approximately $150.0 million, or 31%, from $490.8 million for the year ended January 31, 2014 to $640.8 million for the year ended January 31, 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to increases of $132.9 million and $16.5 million in our Enterprise Intelligence and Cyber Intelligence segments, respectively.\nFor additional information see \"- Revenue by Operating Segment\".\nCost of Revenue\nThe following table sets forth cost of revenue by product and service and support, as well as amortization of acquired technology and backlog for the years ended January 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014:\n\nWe exclude certain costs of both product revenue and service and support revenue, including shared support costs, stock-based compensation, and asset impairment charges, among others, when calculating our operating segment gross margins.\nCost of Product Revenue\nCost of product revenue primarily consists of hardware material costs and royalties due to third parties for software components that are embedded in our software solutions. When revenue is deferred, we also defer hardware material costs and third-party software royalties and recognize those costs over the same period that the product revenue is recognized. Cost of product revenue also includes amortization of capitalized software development costs, employee compensation and related expenses associated with our global operations, facility costs, and other allocated overhead expenses. In our Cyber Intelligence segment, cost of product revenue also includes employee compensation and related expenses, contractor and consulting expenses, and travel expenses, in each case for resources dedicated to project management and associated product delivery.\nOur product gross margins are impacted by the mix of products that we sell from period to period. As with many other technology companies, our software products tend to have higher gross margins than our hardware products.\nYear Ended January 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2015. Cost of product revenue remained relatively unchanged at $145.1 million for the year ended January 31, 2016 compared to $144.9 million for the year ended January 31, 2015. For the year ended January 31, 2016, we recorded a $3.2 million charge for the impairment of certain technology assets associated with a prior business combination in our Cyber Intelligence segment. For the year ended January 31, 2015, we recorded a $2.6 million charge for the impairment of certain capitalized software development costs, reflecting strategy changes in certain product development initiatives in our Cyber Intelligence segment as a result of the UTX acquisition. Our overall product gross margins decreased to 68% in the year ended January 31, 2016 from 70% in the year ended January 31, 2015. As noted above, certain costs are not allocated to our operating segments when we calculate product gross margins by operating segment. Product gross margins in our Enterprise Intelligence segment decreased to 93% in the year ended January 31, 2016 from 94% in the year ended January 31, 2015. Product gross margins in our Cyber Intelligence segment increased from 61% in the year ended January 31, 2015 to 62% in the year ended January 31, 2016. Product gross margins in our Video Intelligence segment increased to 60% in the year ended January 31, 2016 from 59% in the year ended January 31, 2015. The above changes in product gross margins are primarily attributable to changes in product mix in the year ended January 31, 2016 compared to the year ended January 31, 2015.\nYear Ended January 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2014. Cost of product revenue increased approximately 5% from $137.6 million in the year ended January 31, 2014 to $144.9 million in the year ended January 31, 2015. Our overall\nproduct gross margins increased to 70% in the year ended January 31, 2015 from 67% in the year ended January 31, 2014. Product gross margins in our Enterprise Intelligence segment increased from 92% in the year ended January 31, 2014 to 94% in the year ended January 31, 2015 primarily due to a continued decrease in hardware sales as part of our product offerings. Product gross margins in our Cyber Intelligence segment increased from 56% in the year ended January 31, 2014 to 61% in the year ended January 31, 2015 primarily due to a change in product mix. Product gross margins in our Video Intelligence segment increased to 59% in the year ended January 31, 2015 compared to 58% in the year ended January 31, 2014 due to a change in product mix.\nCost of Service and Support Revenue\nCost of service and support revenue primarily consists of employee compensation and related expenses, contractor costs, and travel expenses relating to installation, training, application managed services, consulting, and maintenance services. Cost of service and support revenue also includes stock-based compensation expenses, facility costs, and other overhead expenses. In accordance with GAAP and our accounting policy, the cost of service and support revenue is generally expensed as incurred in the period in which the services are performed, with the exception of certain transactions accounted for using the POC method.\nYear Ended January 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2015. Cost of service and support revenue increased approximately 4% from $239.3 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 to $248.1 million in the year ended January 31, 2016. The increase is primarily attributable to an $11.3 million increase in employee compensation and related expenses due primarily to increased services and support employee headcount chiefly in our Cyber Intelligence segment, and a $3.4 million increase in contractor costs due to increase use of contractors in our Cyber Intelligence and Enterprise Intelligence segments during the year ended January 31, 2016 compared to the year ended January 31, 2015. These increases were partially offset by a $2.4 million decrease in travel expenses primarily in our Enterprise Intelligence segment and a $1.3 million decrease in materials expense incurred to provide services primarily in our Enterprise Intelligence segment. Our overall service and support gross margins were 63% in each of the years ended January 31, 2016 and 2015.\nYear Ended January 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2014. Cost of service and support revenue increased approximately 53% from $156.6 million in the year ended January 31, 2014 to $239.3 million in the year ended January 31, 2015. Employee compensation and related expenses increased $51.3 million due primarily to increased headcount in our Enterprise Intelligence segment in connection with a business combination that closed during the year ended January 31, 2015. Contractor costs, travel expense, and materials expense incurred to provide services increased $10.2 million, $5.2 million, and $8.2 million, respectively, primarily due to a business combination that closed during the year ended January 31, 2015 in our Enterprise Intelligence segment. Stock-based compensation expense increased $3.4 million resulting from an increase in average amounts of outstanding restricted stock units, and increases in our stock price during such period, which impacted the total stock-based compensation to be recognized over the vesting periods. Our overall service and support gross margins decreased from 68% in the year ended January 31, 2014 to 63% in the year ended January 31, 2015 primarily due to a change in the mix of services in connection with a business combination that closed during the year ended January 31, 2015 in our Enterprise Intelligence segment.\nAmortization of Acquired Technology and Backlog\nAmortization of acquired technology and backlog consists of amortization of technology assets and customer backlog acquired in connection with business combinations.\nYear Ended January 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2015. Amortization of acquired technology and backlog increased approximately 15% from $31.0 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 to $35.8 million in the year ended January 31, 2016 primarily due to an increase in amortization expense of acquired technology-based intangible assets associated with business combinations that closed during the year ended January 31, 2016.\nYear Ended January 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2014. Amortization of acquired technology and backlog increased approximately 153% from $12.3 million in the year ended January 31, 2014 to $31.0 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 primarily due to an increase in amortization expense of acquired technology-based intangible assets associated with business combinations that closed during the year ended January 31, 2015.\nFurther discussion regarding our business combinations appears in Note 4, \"Business Combinations\" to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this report.\nResearch and Development, Net\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and subcontracting expenses, facility costs, and other allocated overhead, net of certain software development costs that are capitalized, as well as reimbursements under government programs. Software development costs are capitalized upon the establishment of technological feasibility and continue to be capitalized through the general release of the related software product.\nThe following table sets forth research and development, net for the years ended January 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014:\n\nYear Ended January 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2015. Research and development, net increased approximately $4.0 million, or 2%, from $173.7 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 to $177.7 million in the year ended January 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to a $2.8 million increase in stock-based compensation expense due to a combination of an increase in the number of outstanding RSUs, higher expenses associated with performance-based RSUs, and higher grant-date stock prices during the year ended January 31, 2016 (which are used to determine the grant-date fair value of an RSU), and our bonus share program, further details for which appear in Note 13, \"Stock-Based Compensation\" to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this report. Contractor expenses increased $0.8 million due to increased use of contractors for research and development activities in our Cyber Intelligence segment during the year ended January 31, 2016 compared to the year ended January 31, 2015. Research and development reimbursements received from government programs decreased $1.1 million during the year ended January 31, 2016, primarily in our Enterprise Intelligence segment, resulting in an increase in research and development expense compared to the year ended January 31, 2015. These increases were partially offset by a $0.9 million decrease in employee compensation and related expenses due to decreased research and development employee headcount in our Enterprise Intelligence segment.\nYear Ended January 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2014. Research and development, net increased approximately $47.2 million, or 37%, from $126.5 million in the year ended January 31, 2014 to $173.7 million in the year ended January 31, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to a $37.0 million increase in employee compensation and related expenses due to an increase in employee headcount in connection with business combinations that closed during the year ended January 31, 2015 in our Enterprise Intelligence and Communication Intelligence segments. Stock-based compensation expense increased $3.0 million resulting from an increase in average amounts of outstanding restricted stock units, and an increase in our stock price during such period (which impacted the total stock-based compensation to be recognized over the vesting periods). Contractor expense increased $2.4 million due to increased use of contractors for research and development activities in our Cyber Intelligence segment during the year ended January 31, 2015 compared to the year ended January 31, 2014.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and related expenses, professional fees, sales and marketing expenses, including travel, sales commissions and sales referral fees, facility costs, communication expenses, and other administrative expenses.\nThe following table sets forth selling, general and administrative expenses for the years ended January 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014:\n\nYear Ended January 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2015. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased approximately $2.6 million, or 1%, from $415.3 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 to $412.7 million in the year ended January 31, 2016. Sales commissions expense decreased $3.8 million due primarily to decreased product bookings in our Enterprise Intelligence segment. Employee compensation and related expenses decreased $2.8 million due primarily to a decrease in headcount of general and administrative employees in our Enterprise Intelligence segment. Accounting, legal, and other professional service fees decreased $2.3 million primarily due to higher use of such services during the year ended January 31, 2015 as a result of services provided in connection with the KANA and UTX acquisitions. Travel expenses decreased $2.1 million due primarily to decreased travel expenses in our Enterprise Intelligence segment. The change in fair\nvalue of our obligations under contingent consideration arrangements was a $0.9 million benefit during the year ended January 31, 2016 compared to $0.9 million expense during the year ended January 31, 2015, resulting in a $1.8 million decrease in selling, general, and administrative expense. These decreases were partially offset by increases of $6.4 million and $2.5 million in stock-based compensation expense and facilities expenses, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense increased primarily due to a combination of an increase in the number of outstanding RSUs, higher expenses associated with performance-based RSUs, and higher grant-date stock prices during the year ended January 31, 2016 (which are used to determine the grant-date fair value of an RSU), and our bonus share program, further details for which appear in Note 13, \"Stock-Based Compensation\" to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this report. Facilities expenses increased due primarily to the early termination of a facility lease in the Americas region, and costs associated with entering our new headquarters in Melville, NY.\nYear Ended January 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2014. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately $87.9 million, or 27%, from $327.4 million in the year ended January 31, 2014 to $415.3 million in the year ended January 31, 2015. Employee compensation and related expenses increased $34.5 million due primarily to increased employee headcount in our Enterprise Intelligence and Cyber Intelligence segments, as well as an increase in employee headcount for corporate support employees. Stock-based compensation expense increased $12.6 million due primarily to an increase in average amounts of outstanding restricted stock units, and an increase in our stock price during the period (which impacted the total stock-based compensation to be recognized over the vesting periods). Sales and marketing expense, travel expense, and facilities expense increased $3.8 million, $4.0 million, and $6.4 million, respectively, due primarily to business combinations that closed during the year ended January 31. 2015. Also contributing to the increase in selling, general, and administrative expense was a $9.9 million increase in agent commissions expense in our Communication Intelligence segment, a $5.6 million increase in contractor expense due primarily to increased use of contractors for corporate support activities, including acquisition and integration related expenses, and a $3.5 million increase in the change in fair value of our obligations under contingent consideration arrangements. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $3.5 million in expenses from special performance incentives associated with a prior period business combination that were included in selling, general, and administrative expenses for the year ended January 31, 2014 with no equivalent expenses in the year ended January 31, 2015.\nAmortization of Other Acquired Intangible Assets\nAmortization of other acquired intangible assets consists of amortization of certain intangible assets acquired in connection with business combinations, including customer relationships, distribution networks, trade names and non-compete agreements.\nThe following table sets forth amortization of other acquired intangible assets for the years ended January 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014:\n\nYear Ended January 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2015. Amortization of other acquired intangible assets decreased approximately $2.1 million, or 5%, from $45.2 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 to $43.1 million in the year ended January 31, 2016 primarily due to acquired intangible assets from historical business combinations becoming fully amortized during the year ended January 31, 2016, resulting in decreased amortization on those intangibles compared to the year ended January 31, 2015. This decrease was partially offset by amortization associated with business combinations that closed during the year ended January 31, 2016.\nYear Ended January 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2014. Amortization of other acquired intangible assets increased approximately $20.5 million, or 83%, from $24.7 million in the year ended January 31, 2014 to $45.2 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 primarily due to amortization associated with business combinations that closed during the year ended January 31, 2015.\nFurther discussion regarding our business combinations appears in Note 4, \"Business Combinations\" to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this report.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nThe following table sets forth total other expense, net for the years ended January 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014:\n\n* Percentage is not meaningful.\nYear Ended January 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2015. Total other expense, net, decreased by $13.0 million from $57.7 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 to $44.7 million in the year ended January 31, 2016.\nDuring the year ended January 31, 2015, we recorded a $12.5 million loss upon early retirements of debt. Of this amount, $7.1 million was recorded in connection with the extinguishment of the March 2013 Term Loans (defined below), and $5.5 million was recorded in connection with the retirement of $530.0 million of the February 2014 Term Loans and March 2014 Term Loans (defined below). Further discussion regarding our credit facilities appears in Note 6, Long-Term Debt\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this report.\nInterest expense decreased to $33.9 million in the year ended January 31, 2016 from $36.7 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 primarily due to lower interest rates on outstanding borrowings during the year ended January 31, 2016.\nWe recorded $8.0 million of net foreign currency losses in the year ended January 31, 2016 compared to $13.4 million of net losses in the year ended January 31, 2015. Foreign currency losses in the year ended January 31, 2016 resulted primarily from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Singapore dollar, euro, and Canadian dollar resulting in foreign currency losses on our Singapore dollar, euro, and Canadian dollar-denominated net assets, respectively, in certain entities which use a U.S. dollar functional currency. Also contributing to the net foreign currency loss was the strengthening of the U.S dollar against the British pound sterling, resulting in foreign currency losses on U.S dollar-denominated net liabilities in certain entities which use a British pound sterling functional currency, and the strengthening of the U.S dollar against the Brazilian real, resulting in foreign currency losses on U.S dollar denominated net liabilities in certain entities which use a Brazilian real functional currency.\nIn the year ended January 31, 2016, there were net gains on derivative financial instruments (not designated as hedging instruments) of $0.4 million, compared to net gains of $4.0 million on such instruments for the year ended January 31, 2015. The net gains in the current year reflected gains on contracts executed to hedge movements in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro.\nOther, net, expense increased to $4.6 million in the year ended January 31, 2016 from $0.2 million in the year ended January 31, 2015. Other, net, expense in the year ended January 31, 2016 consisted primarily of write-offs of indemnification assets associated with tax liabilities recorded in connection with prior business combinations.\nYear Ended January 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2014. Total other expense, net, decreased by $1.3 million from $59.0 million in the year ended January 31, 2014 to $57.7 million in the year ended January 31, 2015.\nDuring the year ended January 31, 2015, we recorded $12.5 million of losses upon early retirements of debt. Of this amount, $7.1 million was recorded in connection with the early retirement of the March 2013 Term Loans (defined below), and $5.5 million was recorded in connection with the early retirement of $530.0 million of the February 2014 Term Loans and March 2014 Term Loans (defined below). Further discussion regarding our credit facilities appears in Note 6, Long-Term Debt\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this report.\nInterest expense increased to $36.7 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 from $29.8 million in the year ended January 31, 2014 primarily due to incremental borrowings discussed in Note 6, Long-Term Debt\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this report.\nWe recorded $13.4 million of net foreign currency losses in the year ended January 31, 2015 compared to $6.1 million of net losses in the year ended January 31, 2014. Foreign currency losses in the year ended January 31, 2015 resulted primarily from (i) strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound sterling, resulting in foreign currency losses on U.S. dollar-denominated net liabilities in certain entities which use a British pound sterling functional currency, (ii) weakening of the euro against the British pound sterling, resulting in foreign currency losses on euro-denominated net assets in certain entities which use a British pound sterling functional currency, and (iii) strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Singapore dollar, resulting in foreign currency losses on Singapore dollar-denominated net assets in certain entities which use a U.S. dollar functional currency. Of the $13.4 million of net foreign currency losses in the year ended January 31, 2015, $12.4 million were recorded during the three months ended January 31, 2015.\nIn the year ended January 31, 2015, there were net gains on derivative financial instruments (not designated as hedging instruments) of $4.0 million, compared to net gains of $0.3 million on such instruments for the year ended January 31, 2014. The higher net gains in the current year reflected gains on contracts executed to hedge movements in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro.\nOther, net, expense decreased to $0.2 million in the year ended January 31, 2015 from $1.7 million in the year ended January 31, 2014 due to the inclusion of a $1.1 million write-off of an indemnification asset associated with tax liabilities recorded in connection with the CTI Merger in the year ended January 31, 2014, with no comparable expense in the year ended January 31, 2015.\nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes\nThe following table sets forth our provision (benefit) for income taxes for the years ended January 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014:\n\n* Percentage is not meaningful.\nYear Ended January 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2015. Our effective income tax rate was 4.1% for the year ended January 31, 2016, compared to an effective income tax benefit rate of 70.1% for the year ended January 31, 2015. For the year ended January 31, 2016, our effective income tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 35% primarily due to mix and levels of income and losses among taxing jurisdictions and changes in unrecognized income tax benefits. We recorded tax benefits of $20.2 million as a result of audit settlements and statute of limitation lapses related to domestic and foreign jurisdictions. Pre-tax income in our profitable jurisdictions, where we recorded income tax provisions at rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate, was substantially offset by our domestic losses where we maintain valuation allowances and did not record the related income tax benefits. The result was an income tax provision of $1.0 million on $23.2 million of pre-tax income, which represented an effective income tax rate of 4.1%. For the year ended January 31, 2015, our effective income tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 35% primarily due to the release of $44.4 million of Verint valuation allowances. We maintain valuation allowances on our net U.S. deferred income tax assets related to federal and certain state jurisdictions. In connection with the acquisition of KANA on February 3, 2014, we recorded deferred income tax liabilities primarily attributable to acquired intangible assets to the extent the amortization will not be deductible for income tax purposes. Under accounting guidelines, because the amortization of the intangible assets in future periods provides a source of taxable income, we expect to realize a portion of our existing deferred income tax assets. As such, we reduced the valuation allowance recorded on our deferred income tax assets to the extent of the deferred income tax liabilities recorded. Because the valuation allowance related to existing Verint deferred income tax assets, the impact of the release was reflected as a discrete income tax benefit and not as a component of the KANA acquisition accounting. The effective income tax rate was also affected by the mix and levels of income and losses among taxing jurisdictions, changes in unrecognized income tax benefits, and the recording of valuation allowance on certain income tax attributes of a foreign subsidiary where we do not expect to realize the benefits. Pre-tax income in our profitable jurisdictions, where we recorded income tax provisions at rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate, was substantially offset by our domestic losses where we maintain valuation allowances and did not record the related income tax benefits. The result was an income tax benefit of $15.0 million on $21.4 million of pre-tax income, which represented an effective income tax benefit rate of 70.1%.\nYear Ended January 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2014. Our effective income tax benefit rate was 70.1% for the year ended January 31, 2015, compared to 7.2% for the year ended January 31, 2014. For the year ended January 31, 2015, our effective income tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 35% primarily due to the release of $44.4 million of Verint valuation allowances. As discussed in the prior paragraph, this resulted in an income tax benefit of $15.0 million on $21.4 million of pre-tax income, resulting in an income tax benefit rate of 70.1%. For the year ended January 31, 2014, our effective income tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 35% primarily due to the level and mix of income and losses by jurisdiction and an income tax benefit of $12.4 million for the reversal of unrecognized tax benefits established in connection with the CTI Merger. The recognition of the CTI income tax benefits resulted in a charge within other income (expense), net due to the write-off of an indemnification asset. Pre-tax income in our profitable jurisdictions, where we recorded income tax provisions at rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate, was partially offset by our domestic losses where we maintain valuation allowances and did not record the related income tax benefits. The result was an income tax provision of $4.5 million on $63.3 million of pre-tax income, which represented an effective income tax rate of 7.2%.\nThe comparison of our effective income tax rates between periods is significantly impacted by the level and mix of earnings and losses by tax jurisdiction, foreign income tax rate differentials, amount of permanent book to tax differences, the impact of unrecognized tax benefits, and the effects of valuation allowances on certain loss jurisdictions.\nBacklog\nWhile we have certain projects with multiple deliverables over longer periods of time, for most of our transactions, delivery generally occurs within several months following receipt of the order. As a result, we believe that our backlog at any particular time is not meaningful because it is not necessarily indicative of future revenue.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur primary recurring source of cash is the collection of proceeds from the sale of products and services to our customers, including cash periodically collected in advance of delivery or performance.\nOur primary recurring use of cash is payment of our operating costs, which consist primarily of employee-related expenses, such as compensation and benefits, as well as general operating expenses for marketing, facilities and overhead costs, and capital expenditures. We also utilize cash for debt service under our Credit Agreement and our Notes, and periodically for business acquisitions. Cash generated from operations, along with our existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, are our primary sources of operating liquidity, and we believe that our operating liquidity is sufficient to support our current business operations, including debt service and capital expenditure requirements.\nWe have historically expanded our business in part by investing in strategic growth initiatives, including acquisitions of products, technologies, and businesses. We have used cash as consideration for substantially all of our historical business acquisitions, including approximately $31 million of net cash expended for business acquisitions during the year ended January 31, 2016.\nWe continually examine our options with respect to terms and sources of existing and future short-term and long-term capital resources to enhance our operating results and to ensure that we retain financial flexibility, and may from time to time elect to raise additional equity or debt capital in the capital markets.\nA considerable portion of our operating income is earned outside the United States. Cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash and bank time deposits (including any long-term portions) held by our subsidiaries outside of the United States were $321.5 million and $297.2 million as of January 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and are generally used to fund the subsidiaries' operating requirements and to invest in growth initiatives, including business acquisitions. We currently do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations for the next 12 months or for the foreseeable future.\nShould other circumstances arise whereby we require more capital in the United States than is generated by our domestic operations, or should we otherwise consider it in our best interests, we could repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions, which could result in higher effective tax rates. If available, our NOLs, particularly those in the United States, could reduce potential income tax liabilities that may result from repatriated earnings from foreign jurisdictions to the United\nStates. We generally have not provided for deferred income taxes on the excess of the amount for financial reporting over the tax basis of investments in our foreign subsidiaries because we currently plan to indefinitely reinvest such earnings outside the United States.\nThe following table sets forth our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and bank time deposits, short-term investments and long-term debt as of January 31, 2016 and 2015:\n\nOur operating activities generated $156.9 million of cash during the year ended January 31, 2016, which was partially offset by $85.8 million of net cash used in combined investing and financing activities during this period. Further discussion of these items appears below.\nConsolidated Cash Flow Activity\nThe following table summarizes selected items from our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended January 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\n\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities is driven primarily by our net income (which decreased $14.2 million in the year ended January 31, 2016 compared to the year ended January 31, 2015), adjusted for non-cash items, and working capital changes. Operating activities generated $156.9 million of net cash during the year ended January 31, 2016, compared to $193.7 million generated during the year ended January 31, 2015.\nOperating activities generated $193.7 million of net cash during the year ended January 31, 2015, compared to $178.3 million generated during the year ended January 31, 2014. Our operating results for the year ended January 31, 2015 included $122.1 million of net non-cash expenses, compared to $97.3 million of net non-cash expenses in the prior year, so despite reporting lower net income in the year ended January 31, 2015 compared to the prior year, our operating cash flow improved.\nOur cash flow from operating activities can fluctuate from period to period due to several factors, including the timing of our billings and collections, the timing and amounts of interest, income tax and other payments, and our operating results.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nDuring the year ended January 31, 2016, our investing activities used $75.6 million of net cash, the primary components of which were $31.4 million of net cash utilized for business acquisitions, $30.3 million of payments for property, equipment, and capitalized software development costs, and $21.4 million of net purchases of short-term investments during the year.\nPartially offsetting those uses was $7.5 million of net cash provided by other investing activities, consisting primarily of decreases in restricted cash and bank time deposits during the period. Restricted cash and bank time deposits are typically short-term deposits used to secure bank guarantees in connection with customer sales contracts, the amounts of which will fluctuate from period to period.\nDuring the year ended January 31, 2015, our investing activities used $676.8 million of net cash, the primary component of which was $605.3 million of net cash utilized for business acquisitions, including the acquisitions of KANA in February 2014 and UTX in March 2014. We also had a $36.3 million increase in restricted cash and bank time deposits during this period. The increase in restricted cash and bank time deposits during the year reflected deposits associated with several large sales contracts. In addition, during the year we made $29.2 million of payments for property, equipment, and capitalized software development costs, and made $7.5 million of net purchases of short-term investments.\nDuring the year ended January 31, 2014, our investing activities used $64.2 million of net cash, the primary components of which were $32.8 million of net cash utilized for business acquisitions, $22.4 million of payments for property, equipment, and capitalized software development costs, and $18.9 million of net purchases of short-term investments. Partially offsetting these uses was a $7.7 million decrease in restricted cash and bank time deposits.\nWe had no significant commitments for capital expenditures at January 31, 2016.\nNet Cash (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities\nFor the year ended January 31, 2016, our financing activities used $10.2 million of net cash, including payments of $7.2 million for the financing portion of payments under contingent consideration arrangements related to prior business combinations, and dividend payments of $3.2 million to the noncontrolling interest holders in a joint venture which serves as a systems integrator for certain Asian markets.\nFor the year ended January 31, 2015, our financing activities provided $395.7 million of net cash. In connection with the February 2014 acquisition of KANA, we incurred $300.0 million of incremental term loans and borrowed $125.0 million under the revolving credit facility under our Credit Agreement (defined below). Additionally, in March 2014, we incurred $643.5 million of new term loans, the proceeds of which were used to repay $643.5 million of prior term loans. In June 2014, we completed concurrent public offerings of 5,750,000 shares of our common stock, gross proceeds from which were $274.6 million, and $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.50% convertible senior notes. We used $15.6 million of the net proceeds from these offerings to pay the net costs of an arrangement consisting of the purchase of call options and the sale of warrants to purchase our common stock, the intent of which is to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon conversion of the Notes. We used the majority of the remainder of the net proceeds to retire $530.0 million of the February 2014 Term Loans and March 2014 Term Loans, and all $106.0 million of then-outstanding borrowings under the rvolving credit facility under our Credit Agreement. In connection with these various financing activities, we paid $29.2 million of debt and equity issuance costs, including underwriting discounts and commissions associated with the public offerings. Other financing activities during the year ended January 31, 2015 included payments of $10.4 million for the financing portion of payments under contingent consideration arrangements related to prior business combinations, and the receipt of $17.6 million of proceeds from exercises of stock options.\nFor the year ended January 31, 2014, our financing activities provided $54.5 million of net cash. During this period, we borrowed $646.7 million under our Credit Agreement, repaid $576.0 million of outstanding borrowings under our prior Credit Agreement, and paid $7.8 million of related debt issuance costs. We also received $10.4 million of cash in connection with the CTI Merger during this year. Other financing activities during the year ended January 31, 2014 included payments of $16.1 million for the financing portion of payments under contingent consideration arrangements related to prior business combinations, and the receipt of $10.9 million of proceeds from exercises of stock options.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources Requirements\nBased on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated operating costs, required payments of principal and interest, working capital needs, ordinary course capital expenditures, research and development spending, and other commitments for at least the next 12 months. Currently, we have no plans to pay any cash dividends on our common stock, which are not permitted under our Credit Agreement.\nOur liquidity could be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand for our products and service and support, including the impact of changes in customer buying behavior due to circumstances over which we have no control. If we determine to make additional business acquisitions or otherwise require additional funds, we may need to raise additional capital, which could involve the issuance of additional equity or debt securities.\nOn March 29, 2016, we announced that our board of directors had authorized a new share repurchase program whereby we may make up to $150 million in purchases of our outstanding shares of common stock over the two years following the date of announcement. Under the share repurchase program, purchases can be made from time to time using a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases. The specific timing, price and size of purchases will depend on prevailing stock prices, general market and economic conditions, and other considerations, including the amount of cash generated in the U.S. and other potential uses of cash, such as acquisitions. Purchases may be made through a Rule 10b5-1 plan pursuant to pre-determined metrics set forth in such plan. The board of directors' authorization of the share repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.\nFinancing Arrangements\n1.50% Convertible Senior Notes\nOn June 18, 2014, we issued $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.50% convertible senior notes due June 1, 2021, unless earlier converted by the holders pursuant to their terms. The Notes pay interest in cash semiannually in arrears at a rate of 1.50% per annum.\nThe Notes were issued concurrently with our issuance of 5,750,000 shares of common stock, the majority of the combined net proceeds of which were used to partially repay certain indebtedness under our Credit Agreement, as further described below.\nThe Notes are unsecured and rank senior in right of payment to our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes; equal in right of payment to our indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively subordinated in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally subordinated to indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries.\nThe Notes are convertible into, at our election, cash, shares of common stock, or a combination of both, subject to satisfaction of specified conditions and during specified periods, as described below. If converted, we currently intend to pay cash in respect of the principal amount.\nThe conversion price of the Notes at any time is equal to $1,000 divided by the then-applicable conversion rate. The Notes have an initial conversion rate of 15.5129 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which represents an initial effective conversion price of approximately $64.46 per share of common stock and would result in the issuance of approximately 6,205,000 shares if all of the Notes were converted. Throughout the term of the Notes, the conversion rate may be adjusted upon the occurrence of certain events.\nHolders may surrender their Notes for conversion at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding December 1, 2020, only under the following circumstances:\n \u2022 during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on September 30, 2014, if the closing sale price of our common stock, for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) in the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is more than 130% of the conversion price of the Notes in effect on each applicable trading day; \n \u2022 during the ten consecutive trading-day period following any five consecutive trading-day period in which the trading price for the Notes for each such trading day was less than 98% of the closing sale price of our common stock on such date multiplied by the then-current conversion rate; or \n \u2022 upon the occurrence of specified corporate events, as described in the indenture governing the Notes, such as a consolidation, merger, or binding share exchange. \nOn or after December 1, 2020 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the\nmaturity date, holders may surrender their Notes for conversion regardless of whether any of the foregoing conditions have been satisfied.\nIf we satisfy our conversion obligation in solely cash or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, the amount of cash and shares of common stock, if any, due upon conversion will be based on a daily conversion value for each trading day in a 50 trading-day conversion period. Holders will not receive any additional cash payment or additional shares of common stock representing accrued and unpaid interest, if any, upon conversion of a Note, except in limited circumstances. Instead, interest will be deemed to be paid by the consideration delivered upon conversion of a Note.\nThe conversion rate for the Notes is subject to adjustment as described in the indenture governing the Notes. An adjustment to the conversion rate will result in a corresponding (but inverse) adjustment to the conversion price.\nIf specified make-whole adjustment events\u201d occur, the conversion rate for any Notes converted in connection with such make-whole adjustment event will, in specified circumstances, be increased by a number of additional shares of common stock. In addition, holders may require us to purchase for cash all or any portion of their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change\u201d at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change purchase date.\nAs of January 31, 2016, the Notes were not convertible.\nNote Hedges and Warrants\nConcurrently with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions (the Note Hedges\u201d) and sold warrants (the Warrants\u201d). The combination of the Note Hedges and the Warrants serves to increase the effective initial conversion price for the Notes to $75.00 per share. The Note Hedges and Warrants are each separate instruments from the Notes.\nNote Hedges\nPursuant to the Note Hedges, we purchased call options on our common stock, under which we have the right to acquire from the counterparties up to approximately 6,205,000 shares of our common stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, at a price of $64.46, which equals the initial conversion price of the Notes. Our exercise rights under the Note Hedges generally trigger upon conversion of the Notes and the Note Hedges terminate upon maturity of the Notes, or the first day the Notes are no longer outstanding. The Note Hedges may be settled in cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination thereof, at our option, and are intended to reduce our exposure to potential dilution upon conversion of the Notes. We paid $60.8 million for the Note Hedges, which was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital. As of January 31, 2016, we had not purchased any shares under the Note Hedges.\nWarrants\nWe sold the Warrants to several counterparties. The Warrants provide the counterparties rights to acquire from us up to approximately 6,205,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $75.00 per share. The Warrants expire incrementally on a series of expiration dates beginning in August 2021. At expiration, if the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the Warrants, we will be obligated to issue shares of our common stock having a value equal to such excess. The proceeds from the sale of the Warrants were $45.2 million and were recorded as additional paid-in capital. As of January 31, 2016, no Warrants had been exercised and all Warrants remained outstanding.\nCredit Agreement\nIn April 2011, we entered into a credit agreement with our lenders, which was amended and restated on March 6, 2013, and further amended on February 3, 2014, March 7, 2014, and June 18, 2014 (the \"Credit Agreement\"). The Credit Agreement, as amended and restated, provides for senior secured credit facilities, comprised of $943.5 million of term loans, of which $300.0 million was borrowed in February 2014 (the \"February 2014 Term Loans\") and of which $643.5 million was borrowed in March 2014 (the \"March 2014 Term Loans\"), all of which mature in September 2019, and a $300.0 million revolving credit facility maturing in September 2018, subject to increase and reduction from time to time, as described in the Credit Agreement.\nOn June 18, 2014, we utilized the majority of the combined net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes and the concurrent\nissuance of 5,750,000 shares of common stock to retire $530.0 million of the February 2014 Term Loans and March 2014 Term\nLoans. At January 31, 2016 and 2015, $411.1 million of combined borrowings were outstanding under the February 2014 Term Loans and March 2014 Term Loans, currently bearing interest at an annual rate of 3.50%, and there were no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\nOn February 11, 2016, we executed a pay-fixed, receive-variable interest rate swap with a multinational financial institution to partially mitigate risks associated with the variable interest rate on our term loans under which we will pay interest at a fixed rate of 4.143% and receive variable interest of three-month LIBOR (subject to a minimum of 0.75%), plus a spread of 2.75%, on a notional amount of $200.0 million. The effective date of the agreement is November 1, 2016, and settlements with the counterparty will occur on a quarterly basis, beginning on February 1, 2017. The agreement will terminate on September 6,\n2019. Assuming that we elect three-month LIBOR at the term loans' interest rate reset dates, beginning on November 1, 2016 and throughout the term of the interest rate swap agreement, the annual interest rate on $200.0 million of our term loans will be fixed at 4.143% during that period.\nFollowing the partial retirements of the February 2014 Term Loans and March 2014 Term Loans in June 2014 described above, there are no scheduled principal payments on the term loans until August 2016. The vast majority of the term loan balances are due upon maturity in September 2019.\nThe revolving credit facility contains a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (each as defined in the Credit Agreement) of no greater than 5.00 to 1 until January 31, 2016 and no greater than 4.50 to 1 thereafter (the \"Leverage Ratio Covenant\"). At January 31, 2016, our consolidated leverage ratio was approximately 2.5 to 1 compared to a permitted consolidated leverage ratio of 5.00 to 1, and our EBITDA for the twelve-month period then ended exceeded by at least $120.0 million the minimum EBITDA required to satisfy the Leverage Ratio Covenant given our outstanding debt as of such date.\nContractual Obligations\nAt January 31, 2016, our contractual obligations were as follows:\n\nThe long-term debt obligations reflected above include projected interest payments over the term of our outstanding debt as of January 31, 2016, assuming interest rates in effect for our term loan borrowings as of January 31, 2016.\nOperating lease obligations reflected above exclude future sublease income from certain space we have subleased to third parties. As of January 31, 2016, total expected future sublease income was $1.0 million and will range from $0.1 million to $0.8 million on an annual basis through August 2018.\nDuring the year ended January 31, 2016, we entered into a new operating lease for a facility in Herzliya, Israel, whose lease term commenced on February 1, 2016. The aggregate minimum lease commitment over the 12-year term of this new lease, excluding operating expenses, is approximately $40.6 million. This operating lease commitment is reflected in the table above.\nOur purchase obligations are associated with agreements for purchases of goods or services generally including agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transactions. Agreements to purchase goods or services that have cancellation provisions with no penalties are excluded from these purchase obligations.\nOur consolidated balance sheet at January 31, 2016 included $25.3 million of non-current tax reserves, net of related benefits (including interest and penalties of $3.3 million) for uncertain tax positions. However, these amounts are not included in the table above because it is not possible to predict or estimate the timing of payments for these obligations. We do not expect to make any significant payments for these uncertain tax positions within the next 12 months.\nContingent Payments Associated with Business Combinations\nIn connection with certain of our business combinations, we have agreed to make contingent cash payments to the former owners of the acquired companies based upon achievement of performance targets following the acquisition dates.\nFor the year ended January 31, 2016, we made $7.4 million of payments under contingent consideration arrangements. As of January 31, 2016, potential future cash payments and earned consideration expected to be paid subsequent to January 31, 2016 under contingent consideration arrangements total $51.7 million, the estimated fair value of which was $22.4 million, including $4.0 million reported in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and $18.4 million reported in other liabilities. The performance periods associated with these potential payments extend through April 2020.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of January 31, 2016, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that we believe have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted\nIn April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, and in August 2015 issued ASU No. 2015-15, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements. ASU No. 2015-03 changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements by requiring an entity to present such costs on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. ASU No. 2015-15 provides clarification regarding costs to secure revolving lines of credit, and indicates that the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements as an asset and subsequently amortizing them ratably over the term of the revolving debt arrangement. We elected to early adopt ASU No. 2015-03 as of January 31, 2016, and retrospectively reclassified $10.5 million of debt issuance costs associated with our long-term debt as of January 31, 2015 from other non-current assets to long-term debt. $3.1 million of net deferred debt issuance costs related to our revolving credit facility continue to be reported within other assets on our consolidated balance sheet at January 31, 2016.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes. The amendments in this update require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as long-term on the balance sheet. We have elected to early adopt ASU 2015-17 as of January 31, 2016 on a prospective basis. The January 31, 2015 consolidated balance sheet was not adjusted.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which will require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. Consistent with current GAAP, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease. However, unlike current GAAP, which requires only capital leases to be recognized on the balance sheet, the new guidance will require both types of leases to be recognized on the balance sheet. The new guidance is effective for all periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and we are currently evaluating the effects that the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements, but anticipate that the new guidance will significantly impact our consolidated financial statements given our significant number of leases.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASU No. 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific revenue recognition guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Accounting Standards Codification. Additionally, this update supersedes some cost guidance included in Subtopic 605-35, Revenue Recognition-Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. As originally issued, this guidance was effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption was not permitted. In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date by one year, to interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, but not before the original effective date of December 15, 2016. Entities may choose from two adoption methods, with certain practical expedients. We are currently reviewing this standard to assess the impact on our future consolidated financial statements and evaluating the available adoption methods.", "item_7_tables": "Table 115:
