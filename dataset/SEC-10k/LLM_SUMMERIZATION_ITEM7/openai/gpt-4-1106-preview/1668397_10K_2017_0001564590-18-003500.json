Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This item and the related discussion contain forward-looking statements reflecting current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those indicated in such forward-looking statements. Important factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed under the Forward-Looking Statements\u201d above and Item IA. Risk Factors\u201d in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBusiness Overview\nWe are one of the world's leading clinical contract research organizations, or CROs, by revenue, solely focused on providing scientifically-driven outsourced clinical development services to the biotechnology, pharmaceutical and medical device industries. Our mission is to accelerate the global development of safe and effective medical therapeutics. We differentiate ourselves from our competitors by our disciplined operating model centered on providing full-service Phase I-IV clinical development services and our therapeutic expertise. We believe this combination results in timely and cost-effective delivery of clinical development services for our customers. We believe that we are a partner of choice for small- and mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies based on our ability to consistently utilize our full-service, disciplined operating model to deliver timely and high-quality results for our customers.\nWe focus on conducting clinical trials across all major therapeutic areas, with particular strength in Cardiology, Metabolic Disease, Oncology, Endocrinology, Central Nervous System, or CNS, Antiviral and Anti-infective, or AVAI, as well as therapeutic expertise in Medical Devices. Our global platform includes approximately 2,500 employees across 35 countries, providing our customers with broad access to diverse markets and patient populations as well as local regulatory expertise and market knowledge.\nAsset Acquisition\nIn May 2017, the Company acquired out of bankruptcy NephroGenex, Inc. ( Nephrogenex\u201d or the Debtor\u201d), a publicly-held pharmaceutical company that had previously filed for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The Company, which was the largest unsecured creditor of Nephrogenex, entered into an agreement through the bankruptcy process, to exchange its unsecured claim for 100% of the common stock in the post-bankruptcy, debt-free Debtor. The assets of the acquired Debtor consist primarily of tax attributes as well as in-process research and development and other intangible assets. An analysis by the Company determined that substantially all the fair value of the assets on the date of acquisition is captured in the tax attributes, as the intangible assets account for a relatively immaterial portion of the fair market value of the total assets received. The acquisition of the Debtor was accounted for as an asset purchase.\nThe Company allocated its consideration paid of $1.2 million, consisting of accounts receivable and unbilled receivables and transaction related costs, on a pro rata basis to the assets acquired based on their respective fair values. Acquired assets include intangible assets of $0.5 million, deferred tax assets of $22.2 million, consisting of tax effected net operating losses in the amount of $13.5 million, tax effected capitalized research and development expenses of $8.5 million and tax effected federal tax credits of $0.2 million, and deferred tax liabilities of $0.1 million. The excess amount of fair value received over consideration paid of $21.4 million was recorded as a Deferred credit in the consolidated balance sheets and will be recognized within income tax provision in proportion to the realization of the deferred tax assets and federal tax credits prospectively.\nDuring the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2017, the Deferred tax assets and related Deferred credit balances were revalued due primarily to the impact of tax reform. See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the impact of tax reform on our consolidated financial statements.\nHow We Generate Revenue\nOur revenue consists of net service revenue and reimbursed-out-of-pocket revenue.\n- 58 -\nNet Service Revenue\nWe earn customer fees through the performance of services detailed in our customer contracts. Contract scope and pricing is typically based on either a fixed-fee or unit-of-service model and our contracts can range in duration from a few months to several years. These contracts are individually priced and negotiated based on the anticipated project scope, including the complexity of the project and the performance risks inherent in the project. The majority of our contracts are structured with an upfront fee that is collected at the time of contract signing, and the balance of the fee is collected over the duration of the contract either through an arranged billing schedule or upon completion of certain performance targets or defined milestones. This payment structure is standard in the CRO industry.\nNet service revenue, which is distinct from billing and cash receipt, is generally recognized based on the proportional performance methodology, which is determined by assessing the proportion of performance completed or delivered to date compared to total specific measures to be delivered or completed under the terms of the contract. The measures utilized to assess performance are specific to the service provided. Net service revenue for unit-of-service contracts is recognized as services are performed or delivered. Cancellation provisions in our contracts allow our customers to terminate a contract either immediately or according to advance notice terms specified within the applicable contract, which is typically 30 days. Contract cancellation may occur for various reasons, including, but not limited to, adverse patient reactions, lack of efficacy, or inadequate patient enrollment. Upon cancellation, we are entitled to fees for services rendered through the date of termination, including payment for subsequent services necessary to conclude the study or close out the contract. These fees are agreed upon with the customer and are realized as net service revenue when collection is reasonably assured. Changes in net service revenue from period to period are driven primarily by new business volume and task order execution activity, project cancellations, and the mix of active studies during a given period that can vary based on therapeutic area and or study life cycle stage.\nReimbursed Out-of-Pocket Revenue\nReimbursed out-of-pocket revenue consists primarily of expenses we incur in relation to projects that are reimbursed by our customers with no profit or mark-up. These expenses are defined in our contracts and generally include, but are not limited to, travel, meetings, printing, and shipping and handling fees. Such reimbursements received are included in revenue with the expenditures reflected as a separate component of operating expense. Certain fees paid to investigators and other disbursements in which we act as an agent on behalf of the study sponsor are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations with no resulting effect on our revenue or expenses.\nCosts and Expenses\nOur costs and expenses are comprised primarily of our direct costs, selling, general and administrative costs, depreciation and amortization and income taxes. In addition, as noted above, we also have reimbursed out-of-pocket expenditures that are directly offset by our reimbursed out-of-pocket revenue.\nDirect Costs, Excluding Depreciation and Amortization\nDirect costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, are primarily driven by labor and related employee benefits, but also include laboratory supplies and other expenses contributing to service delivery. The other costs of service delivery can include office rent, utilities, supplies and software license expenses, which are allocated between direct costs, excluding depreciation and amortization and selling, general and administrative expenses based on the estimated contribution among service delivery and support function efforts on a percentage basis. Direct costs, excluding depreciation and amortization exclude reimbursed out-of-pocket expenses. Direct costs, excluding depreciation and amortization are expensed as incurred and are not deferred in anticipation of contracts being awarded or finalization of changes in scope. Direct costs, excluding depreciation and amortization as a percentage of net service revenue can vary from period to period due to project labor efficiencies, changes in workforce, compensation/bonus programs and service mix.\n- 59 -\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses are primarily driven by compensation and related employee benefits, as well as rent, utilities, supplies, software licenses, professional fees (e.g., legal and accounting expenses), travel, marketing and other operating expenses.\nDepreciation\nDepreciation is provided on our property and equipment on the straight-line method at rates adequate to allocate the cost of the applicable assets over their estimated useful lives, which is three to five years for computer hardware, software, phone, and medical imaging equipment, five to seven years for furniture and fixtures and other equipment, and thirty to forty years for buildings. Leasehold improvements and deemed assets from landlord building construction are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the improvement or the associated remaining lease term.\nAmortization\nAmortization relates to finite-lived intangible assets recognized as expense using the straight-line method or using an accelerated method over their estimated useful lives, which range in term from 17 months to 15 years.\nIncome Tax Provision\nIncome tax provision consists of federal, state and local taxes on income in multiple jurisdictions. Our income tax is impacted by the pre-tax earnings in jurisdictions with varying tax rates and any related tax credits that may be available to us. Our current and future provision for income taxes will vary from statutory rates due to the impact of valuation allowances in certain countries, income tax incentives, certain non-deductible expenses, and other discrete items.\nKey Performance Metrics\nTo evaluate the performance of our business, we utilize a variety of financial and performance metrics. These key measures include net new business awards and backlog.\nNet New Business Awards and Backlog\nNew business awards represent the value of anticipated future net service revenue that has been awarded during the period that is recognized in backlog. This value is recognized upon the signing of a contract or receipt of a written pre-contract confirmation from a customer that confirms an agreement in principle on budget and scope. New business awards also include contract amendments, or changes in scope, where the customer has provided written authorization for changes in budget and scope or has approved us to perform additional work as of the measurement date. Awards may not be recognized as backlog after consideration of a number of factors, including whether (i) the relevant net service revenue is expected only after a pending regulatory hurdle, which might result in cancellation of the study, (ii) the customer funding needed for commencement of the study is not believed to have been secured or (iii) study timelines are uncertain or not well defined. In addition, study amounts that extend beyond a three-year timeline are not included in backlog. The number and amount of new business awards can vary significantly from period to period, and an award's contractual duration can range from several months to several years based on customer and project specifications.\nCancellations arise in the normal course of business and are reflected when we receive written confirmation from the customer to cease work on a contractual agreement. The majority of our customers can terminate our contracts without cause upon 30 days' notice. Similar to new business awards, the number and amount of cancellations can vary significantly period over period due to timing of customer correspondence and study-specific circumstances.\nNet new business awards represent gross new business awards received in a period offset by total cancellations in that period. Net new business awards were $426.1 million, $427.0 million and $359.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n- 60 -\nBacklog represents anticipated future net service revenue from net new business awards that have commenced, but have not been completed. Reported backlog will fluctuate based on new business awards, changes in the scope of existing contracts, cancellations, revenue recognition on existing contracts and foreign exchange adjustments from non-U.S. dollar denominated backlog. As of December 31, 2017, our backlog increased by $40.5 million, or 8.4%, to $524.4 million compared to $483.9 million as of December 31, 2016. Included within backlog as of December 31, 2017 was approximately $285 million to $295 million that we expect to convert to net service revenue in 2018, with the remainder expected to convert to net service revenue in years after 2018.\nThe effect of foreign currency adjustments on backlog was as follows: favorable foreign currency adjustments of $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017; unfavorable foreign currency adjustments of $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016; and unfavorable foreign currency adjustments of $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nBacklog and net new business award metrics may not be reliable indicators of our future period revenue as they are subject to a variety of factors that may cause material fluctuations from period to period. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in the scope of projects, cancellations, and duration and timing of services provided.\nExchange Rate Fluctuations\nThe majority of our contracts and operational transactions are U.S. dollar denominated. The Euro represents the largest foreign currency denomination of our contractual and operational exposure. As a result, a portion of our revenue and expenses is subject to exchange rate fluctuations. We have translated the Euro into U.S. dollars using the following average exchange rates based on data obtained from www.xe.com:\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

service revenue, net increased by $15.8 million to $386.5 million, from $370.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily driven by strong activity within the Oncology, Metabolic, and other uncategorized therapeutic areas.\nReimbursed out-of-pocket revenue decreased by $1.3 million to $49.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $51.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Reimbursed out-of-pocket revenues can fluctuate significantly from period to period based on the timing of program initiation or closeout, and these changes do not necessarily correlate to changes in net service revenue. The reimbursements were offset by an equal amount of reimbursed out-of-pocket expenses.\nDirect costs, excluding depreciation and amortization and Reimbursed out-of-pocket expenses\nOur direct costs, excluding depreciation and amortization increased by $13.3 million, to $211.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $198.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributed to higher personnel costs of $9.3 million, laboratory costs of $2.8 million, office rents of $0.8 million and computer, software licenses and maintenance costs of $0.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the prior year, all to support the growth in project activities.\nSelling, general and administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $1.9 million, to $63.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $61.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily driven by higher personnel costs of $2.5 million and professional service costs of $1.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the prior year, to support growth in project activities. This was offset by a reduction in bad debt expense of $2.1 million due primarily to net bad debt recoveries for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to bad debt expense in the prior year.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased by $11.6 million, to $46.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $58.1 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in depreciation and amortization was primarily related to the amortization of our definite lived intangible assets, which are amortized on an accelerated basis.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, in connection with entering into the Senior Secured Credit Facilities (as defined below), the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of long-term debt of $10.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, of which $10.2 million related to unamortized loan origination fees from the credit agreement for our 2014 Senior Secured Credit Facilities (as defined below) and $0.5 million related to third party fees incurred during the fourth quarter of 2016. There was no extinguishment of long-term debt in the year ended December 31, 2017.\nMiscellaneous expense, net\nMiscellaneous expense, net decreased by $0.1 million to $0.4 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $0.4 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2016. These changes were mainly attributable to foreign exchange gains or losses that arise in connection with the revaluation of short-term inter-company balances between our domestic and international subsidiaries, gains or losses from foreign currency transactions, such as those resulting from the settlement of third-party accounts receivables and payables denominated in a currency other than the local currency of the entity making the payment and exit costs related to the previous headquarter lease.\n- 62 -\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense, net decreased by $11.8 million to $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $19.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in interest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2017 was related to the average lower outstanding balance under our Senior Secured Term Loan Facility (as defined below), as well as a lower effective interest rate as a result of the new credit agreement entered into in December 2016 (as described below).\nIncome tax provision\nIncome tax provision increased by $9.3 million, to $17.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The overall effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were 31.3% and 38.9%, respectively. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d (TCJA). The effective tax rate for 2017 decreased from 2016 primarily due to the impact from the TCJA. Excluding the impacts of the new federal tax reform legislation, our effective income tax rate in 2017 would have been an expense of 36.2%. The remaining difference was primarily attributable to the impact of state taxes, domestic and foreign uncertain tax positions and the tax impact associated with acquired tax attributes.\nThe 2017 TCJA significantly reforms the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The TCJA, among other things, includes a reduction in the U.S. federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, allows for the expensing of capital expenditures and puts into effect the migration from a worldwide\u201d system of taxation to a territorial system. The provisional impact on the year ended December 31, 2017 effective tax rate from the TCJA was primarily attributable to a one-time transition tax of $0.6 million on unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries as well as a tax benefit of $3.4 million related to the revaluation of the Deferred Credit which was partially offset by the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and other miscellaneous tax attributes due to the reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.\nWe are still evaluating the impact of the TCJA on our future effective tax rate, but at this time, we expect that the overall impact of the TCJA will decrease our effective tax rate compared to prior years.\nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared to Year ended December 31, 2015\nTable 145:

net and Reimbursed out-of-pocket revenue\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016 service revenue, net increased by $50.5 million to $370.6 million, from $320.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily driven by strong activity within the Oncology and AVAI therapeutic areas.\nReimbursed out-of-pocket revenue increased by $12.0 million to $51.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $39.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Reimbursed out-of-pocket revenues can fluctuate significantly from period to period based on the timing of program initiation or closeout, and these changes do not necessarily correlate to changes in net service revenue. The reimbursements were offset by an equal amount of reimbursed out-of-pocket expenses.\nDirect costs, excluding depreciation and amortization and Reimbursed out-of-pocket expenses\nOur direct costs, excluding depreciation and amortization increased by $34.8 million, to $198.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $163.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily attributed to increases in employee related costs for additional personnel of $23.7 million, contracted services of $4.7 million, and laboratory costs of $2.3 million, all to support the growth in project activities.\nSelling, general and administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $4.5 million, to $61.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $57.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in bad debt of $3.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher bad debt expense incurred in 2016 of approximately $1.3 million compared to 2015, and a net bad debt recovery in the year ended December 31, 2015 of $1.6 million that did not recur in 2016. The year ended December 31, 2015 also benefitted from a $1.1 million gain on litigation from the settlement of an employment matter. The costs for certain advisory and professional fees related to the IPO in 2016 resulted in increases in expenses of $0.9 million while charitable contributions increased $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year. These increases were partially offset by a $1.4 million decrease in employee related costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year. This decrease was the result of a $4.3 million one-time stock based compensation award to our Chief Executive Officer during the year ended December 31, 2015, partially offset by an increase in other employee related costs of $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nImpairment of goodwill\nThere was no impairment of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we determined that the fair value of our Clinics reporting unit did not exceed its carrying value resulting in a $9.3 million impairment of goodwill. This impairment was identified during the annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2015 when we updated our forecasted discounted cash flows to reflect operating results that lagged prior forecasted results.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased by $11.4 million, to $58.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $69.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in depreciation and amortization was primarily related to the amortization of our definite lived intangible assets, which are amortized on an accelerated basis.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, in connection with entering into the Senior Secured Credit Facilities (as defined below), the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of long-term debt of $10.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, of which $10.2 million related to unamortized loan origination fees from the credit agreement for our 2014 Senior Secured Credit Facilities (as defined below) and $0.5 million related to third party fees incurred\n- 64 -\nduring the fourth quarter of 2016. There was no extinguishment of long-term debt in the year ended December 31, 2015.\nMiscellaneous expense, net\nMiscellaneous expense, net decreased by $0.7 million to $0.4 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $1.1 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2015. These changes were mainly attributable to foreign exchange gains or losses that arise in connection with the revaluation of short-term inter-company balances between our domestic and international subsidiaries, and gains or losses from foreign currency transactions, such as those resulting from the settlement of third-party accounts receivables and payables denominated in a currency other than the local currency of the entity making the payment. Additionally, a $0.5 million gain was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2016 in connection with the settlement of certain liabilities related to a prior year change in control.\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense, net decreased by $7.9 million to $19.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $27.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in interest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily related to the lower average outstanding balance under our Senior Secured Term Loan Facility (as defined below) and 2014 Senior Secured Term Loan Facility (as defined below) compared to the prior year. Additionally, our Senior Secured Term Loan Facility, which we entered into in the fourth quarter of 2016, has a lower rate of interest compared to the 2014 Senior Secured Term Loan Facility.\nIncome tax provision\nIncome tax provision increased by $7.7 million, to $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The overall effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were 38.9% and negative 10.8%, respectively. The change in effective tax rates and the increase in income tax provision was primarily due to an increase in pre-tax book income coupled with relatively consistent year over year rate reconciliation drivers.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. Our principal sources of liquidity are operating cash flows and funds available for borrowing under our Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below). As of December 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $26.5 million, including less than $0.1 million of restricted cash, related to advanced payments received pursuant to certain sponsor contracts. Approximately $9.4 million of our cash and cash equivalents, none of which was restricted, was held by our foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017.\nOn August 16, 2016, the Company completed its IPO of its common stock at a price of $23.00 per share. We issued and sold 8,050,000 shares of common stock in the IPO. The IPO raised net proceeds of approximately $173.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions. We used the proceeds from our IPO, combined with cash on hand, to repay $175.0 million of outstanding borrowings under our 2014 Senior Secured Term Loan Facility.\nOn December 8, 2016, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the Senior Secured Credit Agreement\u201d) consisting of a $165.0 million term loan (the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility\u201d) and a $150.0 million revolving credit facility (the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility\u201d and, together with the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities\u201d). As of December 31, 2017, we had $80.0 million available for borrowing under our Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility. Proceeds from the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility were used to repay and extinguish our obligations under the 2014 Senior Secured Credit Facilities as well as pay any fees, costs and expenses related thereto.\n- 65 -\nOur expected primary cash needs on both a short and long-term basis are for investment in operational growth, capital expenditures, payment of debt, share repurchases, selective strategic bolt-on acquisitions, other investments, and other general corporate needs. We have historically funded our operations and growth with cash flow from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities. We expect to continue expanding our operations through organic growth and potentially highly selective bolt-on acquisitions and investments. We expect these activities will be funded from existing cash, cash flow from operations and, if necessary, borrowings under our existing or future credit facilities or other debt. We have deemed that foreign earnings will be indefinitely reinvested and therefore we have not provided taxes on these earnings. While we do not anticipate the need to repatriate these foreign earnings for liquidity purposes given our cash flows from operations and available borrowings under existing and future credit facilities, we would incur taxes on these earnings if the need for repatriation due to liquidity purposes arises. We believe that our sources of liquidity and capital will be sufficient to finance our cash needs for the next 12 months and on a longer-term basis. However, we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to fund our liquidity needs. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to service our indebtedness, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. See Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Relating to our Indebtedness-We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness that may not be successful\u201d in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTable 146: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash Flows (Amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating\nactivities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 97,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 91,732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 85,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12,237\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (13,422\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,432\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (97,828\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (58,008\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (116,489\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of exchange rates on cash,\ncash equivalents, and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (632\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (601\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (10,915\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (37,652\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nCash flows from operations are driven mainly by net income and net movement in accounts receivable and unbilled, net, advanced billings, pre-funded liabilities, accounts payable and accrued expenses. Accounts receivable and unbilled, net, advanced billings and pre-funded liabilities fluctuate on a regular basis as we perform our services, bill our customers and ultimately collect on those receivables. We attempt to negotiate payment terms in order to provide for payments prior to or soon after the provision of services, but this timing of collection can vary significantly on a period by period comparative basis.\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities were $97.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 consisting of net income of $39.1 million. Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities were $45.4 million, primarily related to amortization of intangibles of $37.9 million, depreciation of $8.6 million, stock based compensation expense of $4.5 million, and deferred income tax provision of $3.2 million, offset by $8.8 million of amortization and adjustment of deferred credit. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided $12.9 million in operating cash flows and were primarily driven by increased accounts payable of $4.8 million, increased advanced billings of $7.7 million, and increased pre-funded study costs of $5.3 million, offset by increased prepaid expenses and other current assets of $3.5 million.\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities was $91.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 consisting of net income of $13.4 million. Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities were $71.2 million, primarily related to amortization of intangibles of $50.7 million, depreciation of $7.4 million, loss on extinguishment of debt of $10.7 million, and stock based compensation expense of $9.8 million, offset by $9.0 million of benefit from deferred taxes. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided $7.1 million in\n- 66 -\noperating cash flows and were primarily driven by increased accrued expenses of $4.5 million primarily related to employee related costs, increased advanced billings of $14.7 million, offset by increased accounts receivable and unbilled services, net of $13.7 million, increased prepaid expenses and other current assets of $3.7 million, and a decrease in other assets and liabilities, net of $0.8 million.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $85.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, consisting of a net loss of $(8.7) million. Adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by operating activities were $90.9 million, primarily related to amortization of intangibles of $63.1 million, depreciation of $6.4 million, impairment of goodwill of $9.3 million and stock based compensation expense of $22.3 million, offset by a tax benefit of $12.7 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided $3.7 million in operating cash flows and were driven primarily by an increase in pre-funded cash and a decrease in prepaid assets, partially offset by a decrease in advanced billings.\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily consisting of property and equipment expenditures.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily consisting of property and equipment expenditures.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily consisting of property and equipment expenditures.\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $97.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily related to $155.6 million in repurchases of common stock and $42.4 million in payments on our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, offset by $100.0 million in proceeds from the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $58.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily related to $390.1 million in principal payments on our 2014 Senior Secured Term Loan Facility, offset by the IPO proceeds received of $173.6 million, and the proceeds from the issuance of debt, net of original issue discount of $164.5 million related to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. The remaining activity consisted of rental payments on deemed landlord assets, payment of debt issuance costs, and the payment of common stock issuance costs.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $116.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily related to $116.1 million in principal payments on our 2014 Senior Secured Term Loan Facility.\nShare Repurchases\nIn November 2017, the Board members who are not affiliated with Cinven (the Disinterested Directors\u201d) approved an agreement to repurchase 2,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock from Cinven in connection with a Secondary Offering (as described in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements) for aggregate consideration of approximately $60.3 million, representing a purchase price of $30.16 per share. The Company funded the repurchase with approximately $60.0 million in borrowings under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility and cash on hand.\nIn August 2017, the Disinterested Directors of the Company approved a stock repurchase agreement with Medpace Limited Partnership, a Guernsey limited partnership (the Limited Partnership\u201d acting through its general partner, Medpace GP Limited, a Guernsey company, the General Partner\u201d and, the Limited Partnership acting through the General Partner, Cinven\u201d), pursuant to which the Company repurchased 2,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock from Cinven for aggregate consideration of approximately $60.5 million, representing a purchase price of $30.27 per share. The Company funded the repurchase with cash on hand and $40.0 million in borrowings under our Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility.\n- 67 -\nIn April 2017, the Board of the Company authorized a share repurchase program with an authorized repurchase level of $50.0 million. The share repurchase program was cancelled in the fourth quarter of 2017. Repurchases under the repurchase program took place in the open market or negotiated transactions, at the discretion of the Company's management. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company repurchased 1,342,786 shares of its outstanding common stock for $34.7 million under this share repurchase program.\nThe Company has elected to constructively retire all repurchased shares with all amounts paid in excess of Common stock par value reflected within Accumulated deficit in the Company's consolidated balance sheets, except for 200,000 shares, which are reflected within treasury stock in the Company's consolidated balance sheets.\nIndebtedness\nOn December 8, 2016 (the Closing Date\u201d), Medpace IntermediateCo, Inc., as borrower (the Borrower\u201d), and Medpace Acquisition, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, as parent guarantor (the Parent Guarantor\u201d), entered into the Senior Secured Credit Agreement, which provides for the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility of $165.0 million and the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility of $150.0 million. The Senior Secured Term Loan Facility and Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility expire in December 2021. Borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities were utilized to repay and extinguish our obligations under our existing senior secured term loan facility (the 2014 Senior Secured Term Loan Facility\u201d) and our existing senior secured revolving credit facility (the 2014 Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility\u201d and, together with the 2014 Senior Secured Term Loan Facility, the 2014 Senior Secured Credit Facilities\u201d), as well as pay any related fees, costs and expenses.\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facilities are guaranteed by the Parent Guarantor and its material, direct or indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries, with certain exceptions, including where providing such guarantees is not permitted by law, regulation or contract or would result in adverse tax consequences. All of the obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities are secured, subject to certain permitted liens and other exceptions, by substantially all of the assets of the Borrower and each guarantor, including, but not limited to, a perfected pledge of all of the capital stock of the Borrower and of each guarantor (other than the Parent Guarantor) and, subject to certain exceptions, perfected security interests in substantially all other tangible and intangible assets of the Borrower and each guarantor.\nAs of December 31, 2017, there was $152.6 million outstanding under the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility and $70.0 million in borrowings outstanding under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility. In connection with entering into the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of long-term debt of $10.7 million during the fourth quarter of 2016, of which $10.2 million related to unamortized loan origination fees from the credit agreement for our 2014 Senior Secured Credit Facilities and $0.5 million related to third party fees incurred during the fourth quarter of 2016.\nBorrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities bear interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either (i) the adjusted Eurocurrency rate based on LIBOR for U.S. dollar deposits for loans denominated in dollars, EURIBOR for Euro deposits for loans denominated in Euros and the offer rate for any other currencies for loans denominated in such other currencies for the relevant interest period plus an applicable margin from 1.25% to 2.25% based on the total net leverage ratio from less than 1.50:1.00 to greater than 3.75:1:00, or (ii) an alternative base rate (determined by reference to the highest of (a) the prime commercial lending rate of the administrative agent, as established from time to time, (b) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50% and (c) the one-month adjusted Eurocurrency rate for loans in U.S. dollars plus 1.00%) plus an applicable margin from 0.25% to 1.25% based on the total net leverage ratio from less than 1.50:1.00 to greater than 3.75:1:00. The applicable margin as of December 31, 2017 was 1.25% for Eurocurrency loans and 0.25% for base rate loans. At our discretion, we may choose interest periods of one, two, three or six months, which determines the interest rate to be applied. Interest on the Eurocurrency rate loan continues to be payable at the end of the selected Eurocurrency term and interest on the base rate tranche of the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility is payable quarterly in conjunction with any required principal payments.\nWe also pay commitment fees on a quarterly basis at an annual rate of 0.375% of the unused borrowings under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility for the first full fiscal quarter after the Closing Date, and thereafter at\n- 68 -\n0.50% if the total net leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 3.00:1.00, or 0.375% if the total net leverage ratio is less than 3.00:1.00.\nThe Senior Secured Term Loan Facility will amortize in quarterly installments in aggregate annual amounts equal to (i) 7.5% of the original principal amount of the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility during the first year after the Closing Date, (ii) 10.0% of the original principal amount of the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility during the second year after the Closing Date, (iii) 10.0% of the original principal amount of the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility during the third year after the Closing Date, (iv) 12.5% of the original principal amount of the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility during the fourth year after the Closing Date and (v) 15.0% of the original principal amount of the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility during the fifth year after the Closing Date. The first amortization payment was due on March 31, 2017 and the remaining balance of the original principal amount of the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility outstanding at maturity will be paid in a final balloon payment. The Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility terminates on the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date and loans thereunder may be borrowed, repaid, and re-borrowed up to such date.\nThe following amounts are required to be prepaid in addition to quarterly installment payments and will be applied to repay the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility, subject to certain thresholds, carve-outs, exceptions and reinvestment rights: (a) to the extent that the net cash proceeds of non-ordinary course asset sales or other dispositions of property in a transaction or related transactions by the Borrower and its subsidiaries (including, without limitation, insurance and condemnation proceeds) exceeds $10 million in any fiscal year, 100% of such excess net cash proceeds; (b) 100% of the net cash proceeds of certain debt incurred by the Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries after the Closing Date; and (c) to the extent that net cash proceeds received by the Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries in connection with the disposition of any accounts receivable or related assets to a permitted receivables financing subsidiary exceeds $5 million at any time, 100% of such excess net cash proceeds. In addition to the mandatory payments above, the Borrower may voluntarily repay the outstanding Senior Secured Term Loan Facility without premium or penalty, subject to certain restrictions.\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facilities are subject to customary negative covenants that, among other things, limit the Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries to, subject to certain exceptions and carve outs:\nTable 147: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> create, incur or assume any lien upon any of the property, assets or revenue;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 148: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> make or hold certain investments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 149: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> incur or assume any indebtedness;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 150: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> merge, dissolve, liquidate or consolidate with or into another person;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 151: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> make certain dispositions of property or other assets (including sale leaseback transactions);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 152: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> declare or make certain restricted payments, including dividends;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> enter into certain transactions with affiliates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 154: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> prepay subordinated debt;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 155: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> enter into burdensome agreements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 156: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> engage in any material line of business substantially different from currently conducted business; or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 157: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> change fiscal year.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition, the Borrower is required to report compliance with two financial covenants that are tested at the end of each fiscal quarter. The Borrower is required to maintain a ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness minus unrestricted cash and cash equivalents (in the aggregate not to exceed $50 million and to include not more than $25 million of foreign unrestricted cash and cash equivalents) to consolidated EBITDA for the most recent four fiscal quarter period not to exceed 4.00:1.00; provided that the Borrower shall be permitted to increase the ratio to 4.50:1.00 in connection with any permitted acquisition or any other acquisition consented to by Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Agreement) with total cash consideration in excess of $25 million. Such increase shall be applicable for the fiscal quarter in which such acquisition is\n- 69 -\nconsummated and the three consecutive test periods thereafter. The Borrower is also required to maintain a ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense, in each case for the most recent four fiscal quarter period, of not less than 3.00:1.00. The Company was in compliance with all financial covenants as of December 31, 2017.\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facilities contain certain events of default, including, among others, non-payment of principal or interest, breach of the covenants, cross default and cross acceleration to certain other indebtedness, defaults on monetary judgment orders, certain ERISA events, certain bankruptcy and insolvency events, actual or asserted invalidity of any guarantee or security document and change in control.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had total indebtedness of $222.6 million, of which $152.6 million was attributed to outstanding borrowings on the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility. There were $70.0 million in outstanding borrowings under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2017. In addition, as of December 31, 2017, we had $0.3 million in letters of credit outstanding related to certain operating lease obligations, which are secured by the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nWe have various contractual obligations, which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. Other items, such as operating lease obligations, are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed. The following table summarizes our future payments for all contractual obligations and commercial commitments for the years subsequent to the year ended December 31, 2017:\nTable 158: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 222,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 169,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest on long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,588\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,839\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deemed landlord liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,852\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,131\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 312,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33,846\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 66,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 189,351\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe interest payments on long-term debt in the above table are based on interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2017.\nWe have recorded a tax liability for unrecognized benefits for uncertain tax positions of $5.9 million, which has not been included in the above table due to the uncertainties in the timing of settlement of the income tax positions.\nWe are a party to certain vendor contracts related to clinical services that if cancelled may require payments for services performed and potentially additional services required to protect safety of subjects. The value of these potential wind-down provisions is generally borne by our customers and is not practical to estimate.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOff-balance sheet arrangements refer to any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity not consolidated under our entity structure exists, where we have an obligation arising under a guarantee contract, derivative instrument or variable interest or a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such an entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support for such assets. We have no off-balance sheet arrangements currently.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, or US GAAP, requires us to make a variety of decisions which affect reported amounts and related disclosures, including the selection of appropriate accounting principles and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates. In reaching such decisions, we apply judgment based on our understanding and analysis\n- 70 -\nof the relevant circumstances, including our historical experience and other assumptions. Actual results could differ from our estimates. We are committed to incorporating accounting principles, assumptions and estimates that promote the representational faithfulness, verifiability, neutrality and transparency of the accounting information included in the financial statements.\nNet Service Revenue Recognition\nWe generally enter into contracts with customers to provide services ranging in duration from a few months to several years. The contract terms generally provide for payments based on a fixed-fee or unit-of-service arrangement. Revenue on these arrangements is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the service offering has been delivered to the customer, the arrangement consideration is determinable and the collection of the fees is reasonably assured.\nA majority of our contracts provide for services based on a fixed-fee arrangement, in which revenue is recognized based on the proportional performance methodology. Under this methodology, revenue recognition is determined by assessing the proportion of performance completed or delivered to date compared to total specific measures to be delivered or completed under the terms of the arrangement. The measures utilized to assess performance are specific to the service provided, and the Company generally compares the ratio of hours completed to the total estimated hours necessary to complete the contract. A detailed project budget by hours is developed based on many factors, including, but not limited to, the scope of the work, the complexity of the study, the participating geographic locations and the Company's historical experience. We believe the reporting and estimation of hours is the best available measure of progress on many of the services provided and best reflects the pattern in which obligations to customers are fulfilled. To assist with the estimation of hours expected to complete a project, regular contract reviews for each project are performed in which performance to date is compared to the most current estimate to complete assumptions. The reviews include an assessment of effort incurred to date compared to expectations based on budget assumptions and other circumstances specific to the project. The total estimated hours necessary to complete a fixed-fee contract, based on these reviews, is updated and any revisions to the existing hours budget result in cumulative adjustments to the amount of revenue recognized in the period in which the revisions are identified. Because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating the hours necessary to fulfill contractual obligations, it is possible that estimates may change in the near term, resulting in a material change in revenue reported.\nFixed-fee contracts provide for pricing modifications upon scope of work changes. We recognize revenue related to work performed in connection with scope changes when the underlying services are performed, a binding contractual commitment has been executed with the customer and collectability is reasonably assured. If our customers do not agree to price renegotiation upon changes in our scope of work, we could be exposed to cost overruns and reduced contract profitability. Costs are not deferred in anticipation of contracts being awarded or amendments being finalized, but are expensed as incurred.\nFor unit-of-service arrangements, we recognize revenue in the period in which the unit is delivered. Service unit elements largely consist of various project management, consulting and analytical testing services.\nMany contractual arrangements combine multiple service elements. For these contracts, arrangement consideration is allocated to identified units of accounting based on the relative selling price of each unit of account. The best evidence of selling price of a unit of accounting is vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, which is the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately. When VSOE is not available to determine selling price, management uses relative third party evidence, if available. When neither VSOE nor third party evidence of selling price exists, we use the best estimate of selling price considering all relevant information that is available without undue cost and effort.\nMost contracts are terminable by the customer, either immediately or according to advance notice terms specified within the contracts. These contracts require payment of fees to us for services rendered through the date of termination and may require payment for subsequent services necessary to conclude the study or close out the contract. Final settlement amounts are typically subject to negotiation with the customer. These amounts are included in net service revenue when realization is reasonably assured. We occasionally enter into volume rebate arrangements with customers that provide for rebates if certain specified spending thresholds are met. These rebate\n- 71 -\nobligations are recorded as a reduction of revenue when it appears probable that the customer will earn the rebates and the related amount is estimable.\nWe record revenue net of any tax assessments by governmental authorities that are imposed and concurrent with specific revenue generating transactions.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe grant credit terms to our customers prior to signing a service contract and monitor creditworthiness on an ongoing basis. We assess ongoing collectability by customer through a variety of performance indicators including age of billed receivable, billing type, knowledge of available funding and other information available through internal research. A large percentage of our customers are small biopharmaceutical companies that rely on funding from investors to finance their operations. This creates a heightened risk related to their creditworthiness. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for accounts receivable specifically identified that are at risk of not being collected.\nUncollectible accounts receivable are written off only after all reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted. Moreover, in many cases the Company requires advance payment from its customers for a portion of the study contract price upon the signing of a service contract. These advance payments are deferred and recognized as revenue as services are performed.\nGoodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations. As a result of a prior year change in control, we recognized $670.3 million of goodwill that was allocated to and recorded at the reporting unit level. Our reporting units are Phase II-IV clinical research services, or Phase II-IV, Laboratories and Clinics.\nThe carrying value of goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment, or as indicators of potential impairment are identified, at the reporting unit level. We perform our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter each year, utilizing the quantitative two step model defined by accounting guidance which governs such assessments. The first step involves the comparison of each of our reporting unit carrying values, inclusive of assigned goodwill, to their respective estimated fair values. If a reporting unit carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, a second step requiring us to calculate the implied reporting unit goodwill fair value is performed. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by performing a hypothetical purchase price allocation of reporting unit fair value to the reporting units identified assets and liabilities. The resulting implied goodwill fair value is compared to carrying value to determine the extent of impairment, if any exists. Reporting unit fair value is estimated using a combination of the income approach, a discounted cash flow analysis, and the market approach, utilizing the guideline company method. The reporting unit's discounted cash flow analysis requires significant management judgment with respect to net service revenue, direct costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, selling, general and administrative expenses, capital expenditures and the selection and use of an appropriate discount rate. The projected revenue and expense assumptions and capital expenditures are based on our annual and long-term business plans. Discount rates reflect market-based estimates of the risks associated with the projected cash flows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations.\nIn conjunction with the 2015 fourth quarter annual assessment of goodwill, we determined that goodwill related to our Clinics reporting unit was impaired and we recognized an impairment charge of $9.3 million, which represents 100% of the goodwill that had been allocated to this reporting unit. This impairment was identified during the annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2015 when we updated our forecasted discounted cash flows related to the reporting unit to reflect operating results that lagged prior forecasted results. For our Phase II-IV and Laboratories reporting units, the reporting units' fair values substantially exceeded their respective carrying values including allocated goodwill. There was no indication of impairment related to goodwill based on the fourth quarter 2017 assessment.\n- 72 -\nThis process is inherently subjective and dependent upon estimates and assumptions we make. In determining our expected future cash flows, we assume that we will continue to acquire and convert new business to contract, execute on these contracts with reasonable profit, collect customer receivables and thus generate positive cash flows. However, future declines in the operating results of these reporting units could indicate a need to reevaluate the fair value of these components under accounting guidance governing goodwill and may ultimately result in future impairment. We continue to monitor for any potential indicators of impairment.\nIntangible Assets\nThe Company has an indefinite lived intangible asset related to its trade name valued at $31.6 million. The carrying value of the trade name asset is reviewed at least annually for impairment, or as indicators of potential impairment are identified. The Company performs its annual impairment test in the fourth quarter each year in conjunction with its annual assessment of goodwill. The assessment consists of comparing the carrying value of the indefinite lived intangible asset to its estimated fair value, utilizing the relief from royalty method, an income approach valuation. The relief from royalty method requires management judgment with respect to projected net service revenue, profitability and growth and the selection and use of an appropriate discount rate. There was no indication of impairment related to the trade name asset based on the fourth quarter 2017 assessment.\nOur assessment of impairment charges on any assets classified currently as having indefinite lives could change in future periods if certain events were to occur, including, but not limited to, the following: a significant change in business results, an increase in our discount rates due to a change in our weighted average cost of capital, a decrease in growth rates, economic deterioration that is more severe or longer in duration than anticipated or another significant economic event.\nFinite-lived intangible assets consist mainly of the value assigned to customer relationships, backlog and developed technologies. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized straight-line or using an accelerated method over their estimated useful lives, which range in term from 17 months to 15 years. Amortization expense recognized related to finite lived intangible assets was $37.9 million, $50.7 million and $63.1 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in the forecasting of taxable income using historical and projected future operating results in determining our provision for income taxes and the related assets and liabilities. The provision for income taxes includes income taxes paid, currently payable and receivable, and deferred taxes.\nWe record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial statement bases and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are recorded for tax benefit carryforwards using tax rates anticipated to be in effect in the year in which temporary differences are expected to reverse. If it does not appear more likely than not that the full value of a deferred tax asset will be realized, the Company records a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset, with an offsetting charge to the Company's income tax provision or benefit.\nThe recoverability of our deferred tax assets is estimated based on consideration of all available positive and negative evidence, including, but not limited to, our ability to generate a sufficient level of future taxable income, reversals of deferred tax liabilities (other than those with an indefinite reversal period), tax planning strategies and recent financial performance. The assessment of recoverability is performed on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. Based on the analysis of the above factors, we determined that as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 a valuation allowance in the amount of $2.4 million and $1.0 million, respectively, was required relating to certain foreign operating loss carryforwards, U.S. operating loss carryforwards, a U.S. capital loss carryforward and U.S. state and local operating loss carryforwards. Differences in actual results compared to our estimates and changes in our assumptions could result in an adjustment to the valuation allowance in the future and would generally impact earnings or other comprehensive income depending on the nature of the respective deferred asset for which the valuation allowance exists.\n- 73 -\nWe have recognized certain liabilities, including penalties and interest in the amount of $1.4 million as of the year ended December 31, 2017, within other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. These relate to uncertain tax positions that are subject to various assumptions and judgment. Liabilities for these uncertain tax positions are assessed on a position by position basis. The calculation of these liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in both domestic and foreign jurisdictions. These positions may be subject to audit and review by tax authorities, and may result in future taxes, interest and penalties if we are unsuccessful in defending our positions. If the calculation of liability related to uncertain tax positions proves to be more or less than the ultimate assessment, a tax expense or benefit to expense, respectively would result.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company's accounting position is that unremitted foreign earnings are indefinitely reinvested. The Company has accrued a provisional Transition Tax on the deemed repatriated earnings that were previously indefinitely reinvested. We will continue to monitor our assertion related to investment of foreign earnings and how this assertion may be impacted by the TCJA. See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding how this assertion could be impacted by the TCJA.\nStock Based Compensation\nWe have stock based compensation plans in which we issue stock based awards to employees and directors in the form of vested common shares, stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock awards (RSAs), restricted stock units (RSUs), or other cash based or stock dividend equivalent awards. All of our currently outstanding awards are subject to equity classification pursuant to the terms of the award grants and based on accounting guidance which governs such transactions. Accounting guidance applicable to equity classified awards require all stock based compensation, including vested shares, grants of employee stock options and restricted stock to be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations based on their grant date fair values.\nWe estimate the fair value of our stock options utilizing the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including: the expected stock price volatility, the calculation of the expected holding period of the award, the risk free interest rate and expected dividends on the underlying common stock. Due to the lack of Company specific historical and implied volatility data, we have based our estimate of expected volatility on the historical volatility of a group of peer companies that are most representative of our company. The historical volatility is calculated based on a period of time commensurate with the expected holding period assumption. The holding period represents the period that our option awards are expected to be outstanding. We use the simplified method as prescribed by accounting guidance governing such awards, to calculate the expected term for options granted to employees as we do not have sufficient historical evidence data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected holding period. This simplified method utilizes the mid-point between the vesting date and the date of the contractual term. The risk free rate is based on extrapolated rates of U.S. Treasury bonds whose terms are consistent with the expected holding period of the stock options. We have assumed a dividend yield of zero as we have not historically paid any dividends on our common stock.\nAll our stock based option awards are subject to service based vesting conditions. Compensation expense related to stock option awards to employees is recognized on a straight line basis based on the grant date fair value over the associated service period of the award, which is equal to the vesting term.\nThe following table summarizes the key weighted average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to calculate the fair value of options during the periods:\nTable 159: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected holding period - years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected volatility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected dividend yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n- 74 -\nThe assumptions used in the table above reflect both grant date inputs to arrive at the grant date fair values for stock options subject to equity-classified stock compensation accounting and reflect a fair value calculation for stock options outstanding in the period subject to liability-classified stock compensation accounting. As of December 31, 2017 all outstanding stock based awards were subject to equity classification through either modifications of the award terms and conditions that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2017, or based on terms and conditions applicable as of the grant date.\nThe weighted average grant date fair value of employee stock options granted was $8.54, $6.91 and $3.81 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nEffect of Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for management's discussion of the effect of recent accounting pronouncements.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This item and the related discussion contain forward-looking statements reflecting current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those indicated in such forward-looking statements. Important factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed under the Forward-Looking Statements\u201d above and Item IA. Risk Factors\u201d in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBusiness Overview\nWe are one of the world's leading clinical contract research organizations, or CROs, by revenue, solely focused on providing scientifically-driven outsourced clinical development services to the biotechnology, pharmaceutical and medical device industries. Our mission is to accelerate the global development of safe and effective medical therapeutics. We differentiate ourselves from our competitors by our disciplined operating model centered on providing full-service Phase I-IV clinical development services and our therapeutic expertise. We believe this combination results in timely and cost-effective delivery of clinical development services for our customers. We believe that we are a partner of choice for small- and mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies based on our ability to consistently utilize our full-service, disciplined operating model to deliver timely and high-quality results for our customers.\nWe focus on conducting clinical trials across all major therapeutic areas, with particular strength in Cardiology, Metabolic Disease, Oncology, Endocrinology, Central Nervous System, or CNS, Antiviral and Anti-infective, or AVAI, as well as therapeutic expertise in Medical Devices. Our global platform includes approximately 2,500 employees across 35 countries, providing our customers with broad access to diverse markets and patient populations as well as local regulatory expertise and market knowledge.\nAsset Acquisition\nIn May 2017, the Company acquired out of bankruptcy NephroGenex, Inc. ( Nephrogenex\u201d or the Debtor\u201d), a publicly-held pharmaceutical company that had previously filed for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The Company, which was the largest unsecured creditor of Nephrogenex, entered into an agreement through the bankruptcy process, to exchange its unsecured claim for 100% of the common stock in the post-bankruptcy, debt-free Debtor. The assets of the acquired Debtor consist primarily of tax attributes as well as in-process research and development and other intangible assets. An analysis by the Company determined that substantially all the fair value of the assets on the date of acquisition is captured in the tax attributes, as the intangible assets account for a relatively immaterial portion of the fair market value of the total assets received. The acquisition of the Debtor was accounted for as an asset purchase.\nThe Company allocated its consideration paid of $1.2 million, consisting of accounts receivable and unbilled receivables and transaction related costs, on a pro rata basis to the assets acquired based on their respective fair values. Acquired assets include intangible assets of $0.5 million, deferred tax assets of $22.2 million, consisting of tax effected net operating losses in the amount of $13.5 million, tax effected capitalized research and development expenses of $8.5 million and tax effected federal tax credits of $0.2 million, and deferred tax liabilities of $0.1 million. The excess amount of fair value received over consideration paid of $21.4 million was recorded as a Deferred credit in the consolidated balance sheets and will be recognized within income tax provision in proportion to the realization of the deferred tax assets and federal tax credits prospectively.\nDuring the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2017, the Deferred tax assets and related Deferred credit balances were revalued due primarily to the impact of tax reform. See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the impact of tax reform on our consolidated financial statements.\nHow We Generate Revenue\nOur revenue consists of net service revenue and reimbursed-out-of-pocket revenue.\n- 58 -\nNet Service Revenue\nWe earn customer fees through the performance of services detailed in our customer contracts. Contract scope and pricing is typically based on either a fixed-fee or unit-of-service model and our contracts can range in duration from a few months to several years. These contracts are individually priced and negotiated based on the anticipated project scope, including the complexity of the project and the performance risks inherent in the project. The majority of our contracts are structured with an upfront fee that is collected at the time of contract signing, and the balance of the fee is collected over the duration of the contract either through an arranged billing schedule or upon completion of certain performance targets or defined milestones. This payment structure is standard in the CRO industry.\nNet service revenue, which is distinct from billing and cash receipt, is generally recognized based on the proportional performance methodology, which is determined by assessing the proportion of performance completed or delivered to date compared to total specific measures to be delivered or completed under the terms of the contract. The measures utilized to assess performance are specific to the service provided. Net service revenue for unit-of-service contracts is recognized as services are performed or delivered. Cancellation provisions in our contracts allow our customers to terminate a contract either immediately or according to advance notice terms specified within the applicable contract, which is typically 30 days. Contract cancellation may occur for various reasons, including, but not limited to, adverse patient reactions, lack of efficacy, or inadequate patient enrollment. Upon cancellation, we are entitled to fees for services rendered through the date of termination, including payment for subsequent services necessary to conclude the study or close out the contract. These fees are agreed upon with the customer and are realized as net service revenue when collection is reasonably assured. Changes in net service revenue from period to period are driven primarily by new business volume and task order execution activity, project cancellations, and the mix of active studies during a given period that can vary based on therapeutic area and or study life cycle stage.\nReimbursed Out-of-Pocket Revenue\nReimbursed out-of-pocket revenue consists primarily of expenses we incur in relation to projects that are reimbursed by our customers with no profit or mark-up. These expenses are defined in our contracts and generally include, but are not limited to, travel, meetings, printing, and shipping and handling fees. Such reimbursements received are included in revenue with the expenditures reflected as a separate component of operating expense. Certain fees paid to investigators and other disbursements in which we act as an agent on behalf of the study sponsor are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations with no resulting effect on our revenue or expenses.\nCosts and Expenses\nOur costs and expenses are comprised primarily of our direct costs, selling, general and administrative costs, depreciation and amortization and income taxes. In addition, as noted above, we also have reimbursed out-of-pocket expenditures that are directly offset by our reimbursed out-of-pocket revenue.\nDirect Costs, Excluding Depreciation and Amortization\nDirect costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, are primarily driven by labor and related employee benefits, but also include laboratory supplies and other expenses contributing to service delivery. The other costs of service delivery can include office rent, utilities, supplies and software license expenses, which are allocated between direct costs, excluding depreciation and amortization and selling, general and administrative expenses based on the estimated contribution among service delivery and support function efforts on a percentage basis. Direct costs, excluding depreciation and amortization exclude reimbursed out-of-pocket expenses. Direct costs, excluding depreciation and amortization are expensed as incurred and are not deferred in anticipation of contracts being awarded or finalization of changes in scope. Direct costs, excluding depreciation and amortization as a percentage of net service revenue can vary from period to period due to project labor efficiencies, changes in workforce, compensation/bonus programs and service mix.\n- 59 -\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses are primarily driven by compensation and related employee benefits, as well as rent, utilities, supplies, software licenses, professional fees (e.g., legal and accounting expenses), travel, marketing and other operating expenses.\nDepreciation\nDepreciation is provided on our property and equipment on the straight-line method at rates adequate to allocate the cost of the applicable assets over their estimated useful lives, which is three to five years for computer hardware, software, phone, and medical imaging equipment, five to seven years for furniture and fixtures and other equipment, and thirty to forty years for buildings. Leasehold improvements and deemed assets from landlord building construction are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the improvement or the associated remaining lease term.\nAmortization\nAmortization relates to finite-lived intangible assets recognized as expense using the straight-line method or using an accelerated method over their estimated useful lives, which range in term from 17 months to 15 years.\nIncome Tax Provision\nIncome tax provision consists of federal, state and local taxes on income in multiple jurisdictions. Our income tax is impacted by the pre-tax earnings in jurisdictions with varying tax rates and any related tax credits that may be available to us. Our current and future provision for income taxes will vary from statutory rates due to the impact of valuation allowances in certain countries, income tax incentives, certain non-deductible expenses, and other discrete items.\nKey Performance Metrics\nTo evaluate the performance of our business, we utilize a variety of financial and performance metrics. These key measures include net new business awards and backlog.\nNet New Business Awards and Backlog\nNew business awards represent the value of anticipated future net service revenue that has been awarded during the period that is recognized in backlog. This value is recognized upon the signing of a contract or receipt of a written pre-contract confirmation from a customer that confirms an agreement in principle on budget and scope. New business awards also include contract amendments, or changes in scope, where the customer has provided written authorization for changes in budget and scope or has approved us to perform additional work as of the measurement date. Awards may not be recognized as backlog after consideration of a number of factors, including whether (i) the relevant net service revenue is expected only after a pending regulatory hurdle, which might result in cancellation of the study, (ii) the customer funding needed for commencement of the study is not believed to have been secured or (iii) study timelines are uncertain or not well defined. In addition, study amounts that extend beyond a three-year timeline are not included in backlog. The number and amount of new business awards can vary significantly from period to period, and an award's contractual duration can range from several months to several years based on customer and project specifications.\nCancellations arise in the normal course of business and are reflected when we receive written confirmation from the customer to cease work on a contractual agreement. The majority of our customers can terminate our contracts without cause upon 30 days' notice. Similar to new business awards, the number and amount of cancellations can vary significantly period over period due to timing of customer correspondence and study-specific circumstances.\nNet new business awards represent gross new business awards received in a period offset by total cancellations in that period. Net new business awards were $426.1 million, $427.0 million and $359.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n- 60 -\nBacklog represents anticipated future net service revenue from net new business awards that have commenced, but have not been completed. Reported backlog will fluctuate based on new business awards, changes in the scope of existing contracts, cancellations, revenue recognition on existing contracts and foreign exchange adjustments from non-U.S. dollar denominated backlog. As of December 31, 2017, our backlog increased by $40.5 million, or 8.4%, to $524.4 million compared to $483.9 million as of December 31, 2016. Included within backlog as of December 31, 2017 was approximately $285 million to $295 million that we expect to convert to net service revenue in 2018, with the remainder expected to convert to net service revenue in years after 2018.\nThe effect of foreign currency adjustments on backlog was as follows: favorable foreign currency adjustments of $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017; unfavorable foreign currency adjustments of $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016; and unfavorable foreign currency adjustments of $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nBacklog and net new business award metrics may not be reliable indicators of our future period revenue as they are subject to a variety of factors that may cause material fluctuations from period to period. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in the scope of projects, cancellations, and duration and timing of services provided.\nExchange Rate Fluctuations\nThe majority of our contracts and operational transactions are U.S. dollar denominated. The Euro represents the largest foreign currency denomination of our contractual and operational exposure. As a result, a portion of our revenue and expenses is subject to exchange rate fluctuations. We have translated the Euro into U.S. dollars using the following average exchange rates based on data obtained from www.xe.com:\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

service revenue, net increased by $15.8 million to $386.5 million, from $370.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily driven by strong activity within the Oncology, Metabolic, and other uncategorized therapeutic areas.\nReimbursed out-of-pocket revenue decreased by $1.3 million to $49.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $51.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Reimbursed out-of-pocket revenues can fluctuate significantly from period to period based on the timing of program initiation or closeout, and these changes do not necessarily correlate to changes in net service revenue. The reimbursements were offset by an equal amount of reimbursed out-of-pocket expenses.\nDirect costs, excluding depreciation and amortization and Reimbursed out-of-pocket expenses\nOur direct costs, excluding depreciation and amortization increased by $13.3 million, to $211.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $198.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributed to higher personnel costs of $9.3 million, laboratory costs of $2.8 million, office rents of $0.8 million and computer, software licenses and maintenance costs of $0.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the prior year, all to support the growth in project activities.\nSelling, general and administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $1.9 million, to $63.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $61.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily driven by higher personnel costs of $2.5 million and professional service costs of $1.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the prior year, to support growth in project activities. This was offset by a reduction in bad debt expense of $2.1 million due primarily to net bad debt recoveries for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to bad debt expense in the prior year.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased by $11.6 million, to $46.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $58.1 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in depreciation and amortization was primarily related to the amortization of our definite lived intangible assets, which are amortized on an accelerated basis.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, in connection with entering into the Senior Secured Credit Facilities (as defined below), the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of long-term debt of $10.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, of which $10.2 million related to unamortized loan origination fees from the credit agreement for our 2014 Senior Secured Credit Facilities (as defined below) and $0.5 million related to third party fees incurred during the fourth quarter of 2016. There was no extinguishment of long-term debt in the year ended December 31, 2017.\nMiscellaneous expense, net\nMiscellaneous expense, net decreased by $0.1 million to $0.4 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $0.4 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2016. These changes were mainly attributable to foreign exchange gains or losses that arise in connection with the revaluation of short-term inter-company balances between our domestic and international subsidiaries, gains or losses from foreign currency transactions, such as those resulting from the settlement of third-party accounts receivables and payables denominated in a currency other than the local currency of the entity making the payment and exit costs related to the previous headquarter lease.\n- 62 -\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense, net decreased by $11.8 million to $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $19.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in interest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2017 was related to the average lower outstanding balance under our Senior Secured Term Loan Facility (as defined below), as well as a lower effective interest rate as a result of the new credit agreement entered into in December 2016 (as described below).\nIncome tax provision\nIncome tax provision increased by $9.3 million, to $17.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The overall effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were 31.3% and 38.9%, respectively. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d (TCJA). The effective tax rate for 2017 decreased from 2016 primarily due to the impact from the TCJA. Excluding the impacts of the new federal tax reform legislation, our effective income tax rate in 2017 would have been an expense of 36.2%. The remaining difference was primarily attributable to the impact of state taxes, domestic and foreign uncertain tax positions and the tax impact associated with acquired tax attributes.\nThe 2017 TCJA significantly reforms the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The TCJA, among other things, includes a reduction in the U.S. federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, allows for the expensing of capital expenditures and puts into effect the migration from a worldwide\u201d system of taxation to a territorial system. The provisional impact on the year ended December 31, 2017 effective tax rate from the TCJA was primarily attributable to a one-time transition tax of $0.6 million on unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries as well as a tax benefit of $3.4 million related to the revaluation of the Deferred Credit which was partially offset by the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and other miscellaneous tax attributes due to the reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.\nWe are still evaluating the impact of the TCJA on our future effective tax rate, but at this time, we expect that the overall impact of the TCJA will decrease our effective tax rate compared to prior years.\nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared to Year ended December 31, 2015\nTable 145:

net and Reimbursed out-of-pocket revenue\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016 service revenue, net increased by $50.5 million to $370.6 million, from $320.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily driven by strong activity within the Oncology and AVAI therapeutic areas.\nReimbursed out-of-pocket revenue increased by $12.0 million to $51.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $39.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Reimbursed out-of-pocket revenues can fluctuate significantly from period to period based on the timing of program initiation or closeout, and these changes do not necessarily correlate to changes in net service revenue. The reimbursements were offset by an equal amount of reimbursed out-of-pocket expenses.\nDirect costs, excluding depreciation and amortization and Reimbursed out-of-pocket expenses\nOur direct costs, excluding depreciation and amortization increased by $34.8 million, to $198.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $163.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily attributed to increases in employee related costs for additional personnel of $23.7 million, contracted services of $4.7 million, and laboratory costs of $2.3 million, all to support the growth in project activities.\nSelling, general and administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $4.5 million, to $61.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $57.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in bad debt of $3.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher bad debt expense incurred in 2016 of approximately $1.3 million compared to 2015, and a net bad debt recovery in the year ended December 31, 2015 of $1.6 million that did not recur in 2016. The year ended December 31, 2015 also benefitted from a $1.1 million gain on litigation from the settlement of an employment matter. The costs for certain advisory and professional fees related to the IPO in 2016 resulted in increases in expenses of $0.9 million while charitable contributions increased $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year. These increases were partially offset by a $1.4 million decrease in employee related costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year. This decrease was the result of a $4.3 million one-time stock based compensation award to our Chief Executive Officer during the year ended December 31, 2015, partially offset by an increase in other employee related costs of $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nImpairment of goodwill\nThere was no impairment of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we determined that the fair value of our Clinics reporting unit did not exceed its carrying value resulting in a $9.3 million impairment of goodwill. This impairment was identified during the annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2015 when we updated our forecasted discounted cash flows to reflect operating results that lagged prior forecasted results.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased by $11.4 million, to $58.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $69.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in depreciation and amortization was primarily related to the amortization of our definite lived intangible assets, which are amortized on an accelerated basis.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, in connection with entering into the Senior Secured Credit Facilities (as defined below), the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of long-term debt of $10.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, of which $10.2 million related to unamortized loan origination fees from the credit agreement for our 2014 Senior Secured Credit Facilities (as defined below) and $0.5 million related to third party fees incurred\n- 64 -\nduring the fourth quarter of 2016. There was no extinguishment of long-term debt in the year ended December 31, 2015.\nMiscellaneous expense, net\nMiscellaneous expense, net decreased by $0.7 million to $0.4 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $1.1 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2015. These changes were mainly attributable to foreign exchange gains or losses that arise in connection with the revaluation of short-term inter-company balances between our domestic and international subsidiaries, and gains or losses from foreign currency transactions, such as those resulting from the settlement of third-party accounts receivables and payables denominated in a currency other than the local currency of the entity making the payment. Additionally, a $0.5 million gain was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2016 in connection with the settlement of certain liabilities related to a prior year change in control.\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense, net decreased by $7.9 million to $19.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $27.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in interest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily related to the lower average outstanding balance under our Senior Secured Term Loan Facility (as defined below) and 2014 Senior Secured Term Loan Facility (as defined below) compared to the prior year. Additionally, our Senior Secured Term Loan Facility, which we entered into in the fourth quarter of 2016, has a lower rate of interest compared to the 2014 Senior Secured Term Loan Facility.\nIncome tax provision\nIncome tax provision increased by $7.7 million, to $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The overall effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were 38.9% and negative 10.8%, respectively. The change in effective tax rates and the increase in income tax provision was primarily due to an increase in pre-tax book income coupled with relatively consistent year over year rate reconciliation drivers.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. Our principal sources of liquidity are operating cash flows and funds available for borrowing under our Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below). As of December 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $26.5 million, including less than $0.1 million of restricted cash, related to advanced payments received pursuant to certain sponsor contracts. Approximately $9.4 million of our cash and cash equivalents, none of which was restricted, was held by our foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017.\nOn August 16, 2016, the Company completed its IPO of its common stock at a price of $23.00 per share. We issued and sold 8,050,000 shares of common stock in the IPO. The IPO raised net proceeds of approximately $173.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions. We used the proceeds from our IPO, combined with cash on hand, to repay $175.0 million of outstanding borrowings under our 2014 Senior Secured Term Loan Facility.\nOn December 8, 2016, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the Senior Secured Credit Agreement\u201d) consisting of a $165.0 million term loan (the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility\u201d) and a $150.0 million revolving credit facility (the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility\u201d and, together with the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities\u201d). As of December 31, 2017, we had $80.0 million available for borrowing under our Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility. Proceeds from the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility were used to repay and extinguish our obligations under the 2014 Senior Secured Credit Facilities as well as pay any fees, costs and expenses related thereto.\n- 65 -\nOur expected primary cash needs on both a short and long-term basis are for investment in operational growth, capital expenditures, payment of debt, share repurchases, selective strategic bolt-on acquisitions, other investments, and other general corporate needs. We have historically funded our operations and growth with cash flow from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities. We expect to continue expanding our operations through organic growth and potentially highly selective bolt-on acquisitions and investments. We expect these activities will be funded from existing cash, cash flow from operations and, if necessary, borrowings under our existing or future credit facilities or other debt. We have deemed that foreign earnings will be indefinitely reinvested and therefore we have not provided taxes on these earnings. While we do not anticipate the need to repatriate these foreign earnings for liquidity purposes given our cash flows from operations and available borrowings under existing and future credit facilities, we would incur taxes on these earnings if the need for repatriation due to liquidity purposes arises. We believe that our sources of liquidity and capital will be sufficient to finance our cash needs for the next 12 months and on a longer-term basis. However, we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to fund our liquidity needs. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to service our indebtedness, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. See Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Relating to our Indebtedness-We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness that may not be successful\u201d in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTable 146: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash Flows (Amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating\nactivities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 97,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 91,732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 85,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12,237\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (13,422\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,432\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (97,828\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (58,008\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (116,489\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of exchange rates on cash,\ncash equivalents, and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (632\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (601\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (10,915\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (37,652\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nCash flows from operations are driven mainly by net income and net movement in accounts receivable and unbilled, net, advanced billings, pre-funded liabilities, accounts payable and accrued expenses. Accounts receivable and unbilled, net, advanced billings and pre-funded liabilities fluctuate on a regular basis as we perform our services, bill our customers and ultimately collect on those receivables. We attempt to negotiate payment terms in order to provide for payments prior to or soon after the provision of services, but this timing of collection can vary significantly on a period by period comparative basis.\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities were $97.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 consisting of net income of $39.1 million. Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities were $45.4 million, primarily related to amortization of intangibles of $37.9 million, depreciation of $8.6 million, stock based compensation expense of $4.5 million, and deferred income tax provision of $3.2 million, offset by $8.8 million of amortization and adjustment of deferred credit. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided $12.9 million in operating cash flows and were primarily driven by increased accounts payable of $4.8 million, increased advanced billings of $7.7 million, and increased pre-funded study costs of $5.3 million, offset by increased prepaid expenses and other current assets of $3.5 million.\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities was $91.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 consisting of net income of $13.4 million. Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities were $71.2 million, primarily related to amortization of intangibles of $50.7 million, depreciation of $7.4 million, loss on extinguishment of debt of $10.7 million, and stock based compensation expense of $9.8 million, offset by $9.0 million of benefit from deferred taxes. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided $7.1 million in\n- 66 -\noperating cash flows and were primarily driven by increased accrued expenses of $4.5 million primarily related to employee related costs, increased advanced billings of $14.7 million, offset by increased accounts receivable and unbilled services, net of $13.7 million, increased prepaid expenses and other current assets of $3.7 million, and a decrease in other assets and liabilities, net of $0.8 million.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $85.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, consisting of a net loss of $(8.7) million. Adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by operating activities were $90.9 million, primarily related to amortization of intangibles of $63.1 million, depreciation of $6.4 million, impairment of goodwill of $9.3 million and stock based compensation expense of $22.3 million, offset by a tax benefit of $12.7 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided $3.7 million in operating cash flows and were driven primarily by an increase in pre-funded cash and a decrease in prepaid assets, partially offset by a decrease in advanced billings.\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily consisting of property and equipment expenditures.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily consisting of property and equipment expenditures.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily consisting of property and equipment expenditures.\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $97.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily related to $155.6 million in repurchases of common stock and $42.4 million in payments on our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, offset by $100.0 million in proceeds from the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $58.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily related to $390.1 million in principal payments on our 2014 Senior Secured Term Loan Facility, offset by the IPO proceeds received of $173.6 million, and the proceeds from the issuance of debt, net of original issue discount of $164.5 million related to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. The remaining activity consisted of rental payments on deemed landlord assets, payment of debt issuance costs, and the payment of common stock issuance costs.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $116.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily related to $116.1 million in principal payments on our 2014 Senior Secured Term Loan Facility.\nShare Repurchases\nIn November 2017, the Board members who are not affiliated with Cinven (the Disinterested Directors\u201d) approved an agreement to repurchase 2,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock from Cinven in connection with a Secondary Offering (as described in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements) for aggregate consideration of approximately $60.3 million, representing a purchase price of $30.16 per share. The Company funded the repurchase with approximately $60.0 million in borrowings under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility and cash on hand.\nIn August 2017, the Disinterested Directors of the Company approved a stock repurchase agreement with Medpace Limited Partnership, a Guernsey limited partnership (the Limited Partnership\u201d acting through its general partner, Medpace GP Limited, a Guernsey company, the General Partner\u201d and, the Limited Partnership acting through the General Partner, Cinven\u201d), pursuant to which the Company repurchased 2,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock from Cinven for aggregate consideration of approximately $60.5 million, representing a purchase price of $30.27 per share. The Company funded the repurchase with cash on hand and $40.0 million in borrowings under our Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility.\n- 67 -\nIn April 2017, the Board of the Company authorized a share repurchase program with an authorized repurchase level of $50.0 million. The share repurchase program was cancelled in the fourth quarter of 2017. Repurchases under the repurchase program took place in the open market or negotiated transactions, at the discretion of the Company's management. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company repurchased 1,342,786 shares of its outstanding common stock for $34.7 million under this share repurchase program.\nThe Company has elected to constructively retire all repurchased shares with all amounts paid in excess of Common stock par value reflected within Accumulated deficit in the Company's consolidated balance sheets, except for 200,000 shares, which are reflected within treasury stock in the Company's consolidated balance sheets.\nIndebtedness\nOn December 8, 2016 (the Closing Date\u201d), Medpace IntermediateCo, Inc., as borrower (the Borrower\u201d), and Medpace Acquisition, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, as parent guarantor (the Parent Guarantor\u201d), entered into the Senior Secured Credit Agreement, which provides for the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility of $165.0 million and the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility of $150.0 million. The Senior Secured Term Loan Facility and Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility expire in December 2021. Borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities were utilized to repay and extinguish our obligations under our existing senior secured term loan facility (the 2014 Senior Secured Term Loan Facility\u201d) and our existing senior secured revolving credit facility (the 2014 Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility\u201d and, together with the 2014 Senior Secured Term Loan Facility, the 2014 Senior Secured Credit Facilities\u201d), as well as pay any related fees, costs and expenses.\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facilities are guaranteed by the Parent Guarantor and its material, direct or indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries, with certain exceptions, including where providing such guarantees is not permitted by law, regulation or contract or would result in adverse tax consequences. All of the obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities are secured, subject to certain permitted liens and other exceptions, by substantially all of the assets of the Borrower and each guarantor, including, but not limited to, a perfected pledge of all of the capital stock of the Borrower and of each guarantor (other than the Parent Guarantor) and, subject to certain exceptions, perfected security interests in substantially all other tangible and intangible assets of the Borrower and each guarantor.\nAs of December 31, 2017, there was $152.6 million outstanding under the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility and $70.0 million in borrowings outstanding under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility. In connection with entering into the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of long-term debt of $10.7 million during the fourth quarter of 2016, of which $10.2 million related to unamortized loan origination fees from the credit agreement for our 2014 Senior Secured Credit Facilities and $0.5 million related to third party fees incurred during the fourth quarter of 2016.\nBorrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities bear interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either (i) the adjusted Eurocurrency rate based on LIBOR for U.S. dollar deposits for loans denominated in dollars, EURIBOR for Euro deposits for loans denominated in Euros and the offer rate for any other currencies for loans denominated in such other currencies for the relevant interest period plus an applicable margin from 1.25% to 2.25% based on the total net leverage ratio from less than 1.50:1.00 to greater than 3.75:1:00, or (ii) an alternative base rate (determined by reference to the highest of (a) the prime commercial lending rate of the administrative agent, as established from time to time, (b) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50% and (c) the one-month adjusted Eurocurrency rate for loans in U.S. dollars plus 1.00%) plus an applicable margin from 0.25% to 1.25% based on the total net leverage ratio from less than 1.50:1.00 to greater than 3.75:1:00. The applicable margin as of December 31, 2017 was 1.25% for Eurocurrency loans and 0.25% for base rate loans. At our discretion, we may choose interest periods of one, two, three or six months, which determines the interest rate to be applied. Interest on the Eurocurrency rate loan continues to be payable at the end of the selected Eurocurrency term and interest on the base rate tranche of the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility is payable quarterly in conjunction with any required principal payments.\nWe also pay commitment fees on a quarterly basis at an annual rate of 0.375% of the unused borrowings under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility for the first full fiscal quarter after the Closing Date, and thereafter at\n- 68 -\n0.50% if the total net leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 3.00:1.00, or 0.375% if the total net leverage ratio is less than 3.00:1.00.\nThe Senior Secured Term Loan Facility will amortize in quarterly installments in aggregate annual amounts equal to (i) 7.5% of the original principal amount of the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility during the first year after the Closing Date, (ii) 10.0% of the original principal amount of the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility during the second year after the Closing Date, (iii) 10.0% of the original principal amount of the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility during the third year after the Closing Date, (iv) 12.5% of the original principal amount of the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility during the fourth year after the Closing Date and (v) 15.0% of the original principal amount of the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility during the fifth year after the Closing Date. The first amortization payment was due on March 31, 2017 and the remaining balance of the original principal amount of the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility outstanding at maturity will be paid in a final balloon payment. The Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility terminates on the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date and loans thereunder may be borrowed, repaid, and re-borrowed up to such date.\nThe following amounts are required to be prepaid in addition to quarterly installment payments and will be applied to repay the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility, subject to certain thresholds, carve-outs, exceptions and reinvestment rights: (a) to the extent that the net cash proceeds of non-ordinary course asset sales or other dispositions of property in a transaction or related transactions by the Borrower and its subsidiaries (including, without limitation, insurance and condemnation proceeds) exceeds $10 million in any fiscal year, 100% of such excess net cash proceeds; (b) 100% of the net cash proceeds of certain debt incurred by the Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries after the Closing Date; and (c) to the extent that net cash proceeds received by the Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries in connection with the disposition of any accounts receivable or related assets to a permitted receivables financing subsidiary exceeds $5 million at any time, 100% of such excess net cash proceeds. In addition to the mandatory payments above, the Borrower may voluntarily repay the outstanding Senior Secured Term Loan Facility without premium or penalty, subject to certain restrictions.\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facilities are subject to customary negative covenants that, among other things, limit the Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries to, subject to certain exceptions and carve outs:\n \u2022 create, incur or assume any lien upon any of the property, assets or revenue; \n \u2022 make or hold certain investments; \n \u2022 incur or assume any indebtedness; \n \u2022 merge, dissolve, liquidate or consolidate with or into another person; \n \u2022 make certain dispositions of property or other assets (including sale leaseback transactions); \n \u2022 declare or make certain restricted payments, including dividends; \n \u2022 enter into certain transactions with affiliates; \n \u2022 prepay subordinated debt; \n \u2022 enter into burdensome agreements; \n \u2022 engage in any material line of business substantially different from currently conducted business; or \n \u2022 change fiscal year. \nIn addition, the Borrower is required to report compliance with two financial covenants that are tested at the end of each fiscal quarter. The Borrower is required to maintain a ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness minus unrestricted cash and cash equivalents (in the aggregate not to exceed $50 million and to include not more than $25 million of foreign unrestricted cash and cash equivalents) to consolidated EBITDA for the most recent four fiscal quarter period not to exceed 4.00:1.00; provided that the Borrower shall be permitted to increase the ratio to 4.50:1.00 in connection with any permitted acquisition or any other acquisition consented to by Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Agreement) with total cash consideration in excess of $25 million. Such increase shall be applicable for the fiscal quarter in which such acquisition is\n- 69 -\nconsummated and the three consecutive test periods thereafter. The Borrower is also required to maintain a ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense, in each case for the most recent four fiscal quarter period, of not less than 3.00:1.00. The Company was in compliance with all financial covenants as of December 31, 2017.\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facilities contain certain events of default, including, among others, non-payment of principal or interest, breach of the covenants, cross default and cross acceleration to certain other indebtedness, defaults on monetary judgment orders, certain ERISA events, certain bankruptcy and insolvency events, actual or asserted invalidity of any guarantee or security document and change in control.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had total indebtedness of $222.6 million, of which $152.6 million was attributed to outstanding borrowings on the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility. There were $70.0 million in outstanding borrowings under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2017. In addition, as of December 31, 2017, we had $0.3 million in letters of credit outstanding related to certain operating lease obligations, which are secured by the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nWe have various contractual obligations, which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. Other items, such as operating lease obligations, are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed. The following table summarizes our future payments for all contractual obligations and commercial commitments for the years subsequent to the year ended December 31, 2017:\nTable 158: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 222,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 169,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest on long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,588\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,839\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deemed landlord liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,852\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,131\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 312,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33,846\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 66,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 189,351\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe interest payments on long-term debt in the above table are based on interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2017.\nWe have recorded a tax liability for unrecognized benefits for uncertain tax positions of $5.9 million, which has not been included in the above table due to the uncertainties in the timing of settlement of the income tax positions.\nWe are a party to certain vendor contracts related to clinical services that if cancelled may require payments for services performed and potentially additional services required to protect safety of subjects. The value of these potential wind-down provisions is generally borne by our customers and is not practical to estimate.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOff-balance sheet arrangements refer to any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity not consolidated under our entity structure exists, where we have an obligation arising under a guarantee contract, derivative instrument or variable interest or a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such an entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support for such assets. We have no off-balance sheet arrangements currently.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, or US GAAP, requires us to make a variety of decisions which affect reported amounts and related disclosures, including the selection of appropriate accounting principles and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates. In reaching such decisions, we apply judgment based on our understanding and analysis\n- 70 -\nof the relevant circumstances, including our historical experience and other assumptions. Actual results could differ from our estimates. We are committed to incorporating accounting principles, assumptions and estimates that promote the representational faithfulness, verifiability, neutrality and transparency of the accounting information included in the financial statements.\nNet Service Revenue Recognition\nWe generally enter into contracts with customers to provide services ranging in duration from a few months to several years. The contract terms generally provide for payments based on a fixed-fee or unit-of-service arrangement. Revenue on these arrangements is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the service offering has been delivered to the customer, the arrangement consideration is determinable and the collection of the fees is reasonably assured.\nA majority of our contracts provide for services based on a fixed-fee arrangement, in which revenue is recognized based on the proportional performance methodology. Under this methodology, revenue recognition is determined by assessing the proportion of performance completed or delivered to date compared to total specific measures to be delivered or completed under the terms of the arrangement. The measures utilized to assess performance are specific to the service provided, and the Company generally compares the ratio of hours completed to the total estimated hours necessary to complete the contract. A detailed project budget by hours is developed based on many factors, including, but not limited to, the scope of the work, the complexity of the study, the participating geographic locations and the Company's historical experience. We believe the reporting and estimation of hours is the best available measure of progress on many of the services provided and best reflects the pattern in which obligations to customers are fulfilled. To assist with the estimation of hours expected to complete a project, regular contract reviews for each project are performed in which performance to date is compared to the most current estimate to complete assumptions. The reviews include an assessment of effort incurred to date compared to expectations based on budget assumptions and other circumstances specific to the project. The total estimated hours necessary to complete a fixed-fee contract, based on these reviews, is updated and any revisions to the existing hours budget result in cumulative adjustments to the amount of revenue recognized in the period in which the revisions are identified. Because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating the hours necessary to fulfill contractual obligations, it is possible that estimates may change in the near term, resulting in a material change in revenue reported.\nFixed-fee contracts provide for pricing modifications upon scope of work changes. We recognize revenue related to work performed in connection with scope changes when the underlying services are performed, a binding contractual commitment has been executed with the customer and collectability is reasonably assured. If our customers do not agree to price renegotiation upon changes in our scope of work, we could be exposed to cost overruns and reduced contract profitability. Costs are not deferred in anticipation of contracts being awarded or amendments being finalized, but are expensed as incurred.\nFor unit-of-service arrangements, we recognize revenue in the period in which the unit is delivered. Service unit elements largely consist of various project management, consulting and analytical testing services.\nMany contractual arrangements combine multiple service elements. For these contracts, arrangement consideration is allocated to identified units of accounting based on the relative selling price of each unit of account. The best evidence of selling price of a unit of accounting is vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, which is the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately. When VSOE is not available to determine selling price, management uses relative third party evidence, if available. When neither VSOE nor third party evidence of selling price exists, we use the best estimate of selling price considering all relevant information that is available without undue cost and effort.\nMost contracts are terminable by the customer, either immediately or according to advance notice terms specified within the contracts. These contracts require payment of fees to us for services rendered through the date of termination and may require payment for subsequent services necessary to conclude the study or close out the contract. Final settlement amounts are typically subject to negotiation with the customer. These amounts are included in net service revenue when realization is reasonably assured. We occasionally enter into volume rebate arrangements with customers that provide for rebates if certain specified spending thresholds are met. These rebate\n- 71 -\nobligations are recorded as a reduction of revenue when it appears probable that the customer will earn the rebates and the related amount is estimable.\nWe record revenue net of any tax assessments by governmental authorities that are imposed and concurrent with specific revenue generating transactions.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe grant credit terms to our customers prior to signing a service contract and monitor creditworthiness on an ongoing basis. We assess ongoing collectability by customer through a variety of performance indicators including age of billed receivable, billing type, knowledge of available funding and other information available through internal research. A large percentage of our customers are small biopharmaceutical companies that rely on funding from investors to finance their operations. This creates a heightened risk related to their creditworthiness. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for accounts receivable specifically identified that are at risk of not being collected.\nUncollectible accounts receivable are written off only after all reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted. Moreover, in many cases the Company requires advance payment from its customers for a portion of the study contract price upon the signing of a service contract. These advance payments are deferred and recognized as revenue as services are performed.\nGoodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations. As a result of a prior year change in control, we recognized $670.3 million of goodwill that was allocated to and recorded at the reporting unit level. Our reporting units are Phase II-IV clinical research services, or Phase II-IV, Laboratories and Clinics.\nThe carrying value of goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment, or as indicators of potential impairment are identified, at the reporting unit level. We perform our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter each year, utilizing the quantitative two step model defined by accounting guidance which governs such assessments. The first step involves the comparison of each of our reporting unit carrying values, inclusive of assigned goodwill, to their respective estimated fair values. If a reporting unit carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, a second step requiring us to calculate the implied reporting unit goodwill fair value is performed. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by performing a hypothetical purchase price allocation of reporting unit fair value to the reporting units identified assets and liabilities. The resulting implied goodwill fair value is compared to carrying value to determine the extent of impairment, if any exists. Reporting unit fair value is estimated using a combination of the income approach, a discounted cash flow analysis, and the market approach, utilizing the guideline company method. The reporting unit's discounted cash flow analysis requires significant management judgment with respect to net service revenue, direct costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, selling, general and administrative expenses, capital expenditures and the selection and use of an appropriate discount rate. The projected revenue and expense assumptions and capital expenditures are based on our annual and long-term business plans. Discount rates reflect market-based estimates of the risks associated with the projected cash flows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations.\nIn conjunction with the 2015 fourth quarter annual assessment of goodwill, we determined that goodwill related to our Clinics reporting unit was impaired and we recognized an impairment charge of $9.3 million, which represents 100% of the goodwill that had been allocated to this reporting unit. This impairment was identified during the annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2015 when we updated our forecasted discounted cash flows related to the reporting unit to reflect operating results that lagged prior forecasted results. For our Phase II-IV and Laboratories reporting units, the reporting units' fair values substantially exceeded their respective carrying values including allocated goodwill. There was no indication of impairment related to goodwill based on the fourth quarter 2017 assessment.\n- 72 -\nThis process is inherently subjective and dependent upon estimates and assumptions we make. In determining our expected future cash flows, we assume that we will continue to acquire and convert new business to contract, execute on these contracts with reasonable profit, collect customer receivables and thus generate positive cash flows. However, future declines in the operating results of these reporting units could indicate a need to reevaluate the fair value of these components under accounting guidance governing goodwill and may ultimately result in future impairment. We continue to monitor for any potential indicators of impairment.\nIntangible Assets\nThe Company has an indefinite lived intangible asset related to its trade name valued at $31.6 million. The carrying value of the trade name asset is reviewed at least annually for impairment, or as indicators of potential impairment are identified. The Company performs its annual impairment test in the fourth quarter each year in conjunction with its annual assessment of goodwill. The assessment consists of comparing the carrying value of the indefinite lived intangible asset to its estimated fair value, utilizing the relief from royalty method, an income approach valuation. The relief from royalty method requires management judgment with respect to projected net service revenue, profitability and growth and the selection and use of an appropriate discount rate. There was no indication of impairment related to the trade name asset based on the fourth quarter 2017 assessment.\nOur assessment of impairment charges on any assets classified currently as having indefinite lives could change in future periods if certain events were to occur, including, but not limited to, the following: a significant change in business results, an increase in our discount rates due to a change in our weighted average cost of capital, a decrease in growth rates, economic deterioration that is more severe or longer in duration than anticipated or another significant economic event.\nFinite-lived intangible assets consist mainly of the value assigned to customer relationships, backlog and developed technologies. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized straight-line or using an accelerated method over their estimated useful lives, which range in term from 17 months to 15 years. Amortization expense recognized related to finite lived intangible assets was $37.9 million, $50.7 million and $63.1 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in the forecasting of taxable income using historical and projected future operating results in determining our provision for income taxes and the related assets and liabilities. The provision for income taxes includes income taxes paid, currently payable and receivable, and deferred taxes.\nWe record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial statement bases and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are recorded for tax benefit carryforwards using tax rates anticipated to be in effect in the year in which temporary differences are expected to reverse. If it does not appear more likely than not that the full value of a deferred tax asset will be realized, the Company records a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset, with an offsetting charge to the Company's income tax provision or benefit.\nThe recoverability of our deferred tax assets is estimated based on consideration of all available positive and negative evidence, including, but not limited to, our ability to generate a sufficient level of future taxable income, reversals of deferred tax liabilities (other than those with an indefinite reversal period), tax planning strategies and recent financial performance. The assessment of recoverability is performed on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. Based on the analysis of the above factors, we determined that as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 a valuation allowance in the amount of $2.4 million and $1.0 million, respectively, was required relating to certain foreign operating loss carryforwards, U.S. operating loss carryforwards, a U.S. capital loss carryforward and U.S. state and local operating loss carryforwards. Differences in actual results compared to our estimates and changes in our assumptions could result in an adjustment to the valuation allowance in the future and would generally impact earnings or other comprehensive income depending on the nature of the respective deferred asset for which the valuation allowance exists.\n- 73 -\nWe have recognized certain liabilities, including penalties and interest in the amount of $1.4 million as of the year ended December 31, 2017, within other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. These relate to uncertain tax positions that are subject to various assumptions and judgment. Liabilities for these uncertain tax positions are assessed on a position by position basis. The calculation of these liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in both domestic and foreign jurisdictions. These positions may be subject to audit and review by tax authorities, and may result in future taxes, interest and penalties if we are unsuccessful in defending our positions. If the calculation of liability related to uncertain tax positions proves to be more or less than the ultimate assessment, a tax expense or benefit to expense, respectively would result.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company's accounting position is that unremitted foreign earnings are indefinitely reinvested. The Company has accrued a provisional Transition Tax on the deemed repatriated earnings that were previously indefinitely reinvested. We will continue to monitor our assertion related to investment of foreign earnings and how this assertion may be impacted by the TCJA. See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding how this assertion could be impacted by the TCJA.\nStock Based Compensation\nWe have stock based compensation plans in which we issue stock based awards to employees and directors in the form of vested common shares, stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock awards (RSAs), restricted stock units (RSUs), or other cash based or stock dividend equivalent awards. All of our currently outstanding awards are subject to equity classification pursuant to the terms of the award grants and based on accounting guidance which governs such transactions. Accounting guidance applicable to equity classified awards require all stock based compensation, including vested shares, grants of employee stock options and restricted stock to be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations based on their grant date fair values.\nWe estimate the fair value of our stock options utilizing the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including: the expected stock price volatility, the calculation of the expected holding period of the award, the risk free interest rate and expected dividends on the underlying common stock. Due to the lack of Company specific historical and implied volatility data, we have based our estimate of expected volatility on the historical volatility of a group of peer companies that are most representative of our company. The historical volatility is calculated based on a period of time commensurate with the expected holding period assumption. The holding period represents the period that our option awards are expected to be outstanding. We use the simplified method as prescribed by accounting guidance governing such awards, to calculate the expected term for options granted to employees as we do not have sufficient historical evidence data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected holding period. This simplified method utilizes the mid-point between the vesting date and the date of the contractual term. The risk free rate is based on extrapolated rates of U.S. Treasury bonds whose terms are consistent with the expected holding period of the stock options. We have assumed a dividend yield of zero as we have not historically paid any dividends on our common stock.\nAll our stock based option awards are subject to service based vesting conditions. Compensation expense related to stock option awards to employees is recognized on a straight line basis based on the grant date fair value over the associated service period of the award, which is equal to the vesting term.\nThe following table summarizes the key weighted average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to calculate the fair value of options during the periods:\nTable 159: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected holding period - years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected volatility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected dividend yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n- 74 -\nThe assumptions used in the table above reflect both grant date inputs to arrive at the grant date fair values for stock options subject to equity-classified stock compensation accounting and reflect a fair value calculation for stock options outstanding in the period subject to liability-classified stock compensation accounting. As of December 31, 2017 all outstanding stock based awards were subject to equity classification through either modifications of the award terms and conditions that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2017, or based on terms and conditions applicable as of the grant date.\nThe weighted average grant date fair value of employee stock options granted was $8.54, $6.91 and $3.81 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nEffect of Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for management's discussion of the effect of recent accounting pronouncements.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This item and the related discussion contain forward-looking statements reflecting current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those indicated in such forward-looking statements. Important factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed under the Forward-Looking Statements\u201d above and Item IA. Risk Factors\u201d in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBusiness Overview\nWe are one of the world's leading clinical contract research organizations, or CROs, by revenue, solely focused on providing scientifically-driven outsourced clinical development services to the biotechnology, pharmaceutical and medical device industries. Our mission is to accelerate the global development of safe and effective medical therapeutics. We differentiate ourselves from our competitors by our disciplined operating model centered on providing full-service Phase I-IV clinical development services and our therapeutic expertise. We believe this combination results in timely and cost-effective delivery of clinical development services for our customers. We believe that we are a partner of choice for small- and mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies based on our ability to consistently utilize our full-service, disciplined operating model to deliver timely and high-quality results for our customers.\nWe focus on conducting clinical trials across all major therapeutic areas, with particular strength in Cardiology, Metabolic Disease, Oncology, Endocrinology, Central Nervous System, or CNS, Antiviral and Anti-infective, or AVAI, as well as therapeutic expertise in Medical Devices. Our global platform includes approximately 2,500 employees across 35 countries, providing our customers with broad access to diverse markets and patient populations as well as local regulatory expertise and market knowledge.\nAsset Acquisition\nIn May 2017, the Company acquired out of bankruptcy NephroGenex, Inc. ( Nephrogenex\u201d or the Debtor\u201d), a publicly-held pharmaceutical company that had previously filed for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The Company, which was the largest unsecured creditor of Nephrogenex, entered into an agreement through the bankruptcy process, to exchange its unsecured claim for 100% of the common stock in the post-bankruptcy, debt-free Debtor. The assets of the acquired Debtor consist primarily of tax attributes as well as in-process research and development and other intangible assets. An analysis by the Company determined that substantially all the fair value of the assets on the date of acquisition is captured in the tax attributes, as the intangible assets account for a relatively immaterial portion of the fair market value of the total assets received. The acquisition of the Debtor was accounted for as an asset purchase.\nThe Company allocated its consideration paid of $1.2 million, consisting of accounts receivable and unbilled receivables and transaction related costs, on a pro rata basis to the assets acquired based on their respective fair values. Acquired assets include intangible assets of $0.5 million, deferred tax assets of $22.2 million, consisting of tax effected net operating losses in the amount of $13.5 million, tax effected capitalized research and development expenses of $8.5 million and tax effected federal tax credits of $0.2 million, and deferred tax liabilities of $0.1 million. The excess amount of fair value received over consideration paid of $21.4 million was recorded as a Deferred credit in the consolidated balance sheets and will be recognized within income tax provision in proportion to the realization of the deferred tax assets and federal tax credits prospectively.\nDuring the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2017, the Deferred tax assets and related Deferred credit balances were revalued due primarily to the impact of tax reform. See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the impact of tax reform on our consolidated financial statements.\nHow We Generate Revenue\nOur revenue consists of net service revenue and reimbursed-out-of-pocket revenue.\n- 58 -\nNet Service Revenue\nWe earn customer fees through the performance of services detailed in our customer contracts. Contract scope and pricing is typically based on either a fixed-fee or unit-of-service model and our contracts can range in duration from a few months to several years. These contracts are individually priced and negotiated based on the anticipated project scope, including the complexity of the project and the performance risks inherent in the project. The majority of our contracts are structured with an upfront fee that is collected at the time of contract signing, and the balance of the fee is collected over the duration of the contract either through an arranged billing schedule or upon completion of certain performance targets or defined milestones. This payment structure is standard in the CRO industry.\nNet service revenue, which is distinct from billing and cash receipt, is generally recognized based on the proportional performance methodology, which is determined by assessing the proportion of performance completed or delivered to date compared to total specific measures to be delivered or completed under the terms of the contract. The measures utilized to assess performance are specific to the service provided. Net service revenue for unit-of-service contracts is recognized as services are performed or delivered. Cancellation provisions in our contracts allow our customers to terminate a contract either immediately or according to advance notice terms specified within the applicable contract, which is typically 30 days. Contract cancellation may occur for various reasons, including, but not limited to, adverse patient reactions, lack of efficacy, or inadequate patient enrollment. Upon cancellation, we are entitled to fees for services rendered through the date of termination, including payment for subsequent services necessary to conclude the study or close out the contract. These fees are agreed upon with the customer and are realized as net service revenue when collection is reasonably assured. Changes in net service revenue from period to period are driven primarily by new business volume and task order execution activity, project cancellations, and the mix of active studies during a given period that can vary based on therapeutic area and or study life cycle stage.\nReimbursed Out-of-Pocket Revenue\nReimbursed out-of-pocket revenue consists primarily of expenses we incur in relation to projects that are reimbursed by our customers with no profit or mark-up. These expenses are defined in our contracts and generally include, but are not limited to, travel, meetings, printing, and shipping and handling fees. Such reimbursements received are included in revenue with the expenditures reflected as a separate component of operating expense. Certain fees paid to investigators and other disbursements in which we act as an agent on behalf of the study sponsor are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations with no resulting effect on our revenue or expenses.\nCosts and Expenses\nOur costs and expenses are comprised primarily of our direct costs, selling, general and administrative costs, depreciation and amortization and income taxes. In addition, as noted above, we also have reimbursed out-of-pocket expenditures that are directly offset by our reimbursed out-of-pocket revenue.\nDirect Costs, Excluding Depreciation and Amortization\nDirect costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, are primarily driven by labor and related employee benefits, but also include laboratory supplies and other expenses contributing to service delivery. The other costs of service delivery can include office rent, utilities, supplies and software license expenses, which are allocated between direct costs, excluding depreciation and amortization and selling, general and administrative expenses based on the estimated contribution among service delivery and support function efforts on a percentage basis. Direct costs, excluding depreciation and amortization exclude reimbursed out-of-pocket expenses. Direct costs, excluding depreciation and amortization are expensed as incurred and are not deferred in anticipation of contracts being awarded or finalization of changes in scope. Direct costs, excluding depreciation and amortization as a percentage of net service revenue can vary from period to period due to project labor efficiencies, changes in workforce, compensation/bonus programs and service mix.\n- 59 -\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses are primarily driven by compensation and related employee benefits, as well as rent, utilities, supplies, software licenses, professional fees (e.g., legal and accounting expenses), travel, marketing and other operating expenses.\nDepreciation\nDepreciation is provided on our property and equipment on the straight-line method at rates adequate to allocate the cost of the applicable assets over their estimated useful lives, which is three to five years for computer hardware, software, phone, and medical imaging equipment, five to seven years for furniture and fixtures and other equipment, and thirty to forty years for buildings. Leasehold improvements and deemed assets from landlord building construction are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the improvement or the associated remaining lease term.\nAmortization\nAmortization relates to finite-lived intangible assets recognized as expense using the straight-line method or using an accelerated method over their estimated useful lives, which range in term from 17 months to 15 years.\nIncome Tax Provision\nIncome tax provision consists of federal, state and local taxes on income in multiple jurisdictions. Our income tax is impacted by the pre-tax earnings in jurisdictions with varying tax rates and any related tax credits that may be available to us. Our current and future provision for income taxes will vary from statutory rates due to the impact of valuation allowances in certain countries, income tax incentives, certain non-deductible expenses, and other discrete items.\nKey Performance Metrics\nTo evaluate the performance of our business, we utilize a variety of financial and performance metrics. These key measures include net new business awards and backlog.\nNet New Business Awards and Backlog\nNew business awards represent the value of anticipated future net service revenue that has been awarded during the period that is recognized in backlog. This value is recognized upon the signing of a contract or receipt of a written pre-contract confirmation from a customer that confirms an agreement in principle on budget and scope. New business awards also include contract amendments, or changes in scope, where the customer has provided written authorization for changes in budget and scope or has approved us to perform additional work as of the measurement date. Awards may not be recognized as backlog after consideration of a number of factors, including whether (i) the relevant net service revenue is expected only after a pending regulatory hurdle, which might result in cancellation of the study, (ii) the customer funding needed for commencement of the study is not believed to have been secured or (iii) study timelines are uncertain or not well defined. In addition, study amounts that extend beyond a three-year timeline are not included in backlog. The number and amount of new business awards can vary significantly from period to period, and an award's contractual duration can range from several months to several years based on customer and project specifications.\nCancellations arise in the normal course of business and are reflected when we receive written confirmation from the customer to cease work on a contractual agreement. The majority of our customers can terminate our contracts without cause upon 30 days' notice. Similar to new business awards, the number and amount of cancellations can vary significantly period over period due to timing of customer correspondence and study-specific circumstances.\nNet new business awards represent gross new business awards received in a period offset by total cancellations in that period. Net new business awards were $426.1 million, $427.0 million and $359.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n- 60 -\nBacklog represents anticipated future net service revenue from net new business awards that have commenced, but have not been completed. Reported backlog will fluctuate based on new business awards, changes in the scope of existing contracts, cancellations, revenue recognition on existing contracts and foreign exchange adjustments from non-U.S. dollar denominated backlog. As of December 31, 2017, our backlog increased by $40.5 million, or 8.4%, to $524.4 million compared to $483.9 million as of December 31, 2016. Included within backlog as of December 31, 2017 was approximately $285 million to $295 million that we expect to convert to net service revenue in 2018, with the remainder expected to convert to net service revenue in years after 2018.\nThe effect of foreign currency adjustments on backlog was as follows: favorable foreign currency adjustments of $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017; unfavorable foreign currency adjustments of $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016; and unfavorable foreign currency adjustments of $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nBacklog and net new business award metrics may not be reliable indicators of our future period revenue as they are subject to a variety of factors that may cause material fluctuations from period to period. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in the scope of projects, cancellations, and duration and timing of services provided.\nExchange Rate Fluctuations\nThe majority of our contracts and operational transactions are U.S. dollar denominated. The Euro represents the largest foreign currency denomination of our contractual and operational exposure. As a result, a portion of our revenue and expenses is subject to exchange rate fluctuations. We have translated the Euro into U.S. dollars using the following average exchange rates based on data obtained from www.xe.com:\n\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\n\n- 61 -\nService revenue, net and Reimbursed out-of-pocket revenue\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 service revenue, net increased by $15.8 million to $386.5 million, from $370.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily driven by strong activity within the Oncology, Metabolic, and other uncategorized therapeutic areas.\nReimbursed out-of-pocket revenue decreased by $1.3 million to $49.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $51.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Reimbursed out-of-pocket revenues can fluctuate significantly from period to period based on the timing of program initiation or closeout, and these changes do not necessarily correlate to changes in net service revenue. The reimbursements were offset by an equal amount of reimbursed out-of-pocket expenses.\nDirect costs, excluding depreciation and amortization and Reimbursed out-of-pocket expenses\nOur direct costs, excluding depreciation and amortization increased by $13.3 million, to $211.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $198.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributed to higher personnel costs of $9.3 million, laboratory costs of $2.8 million, office rents of $0.8 million and computer, software licenses and maintenance costs of $0.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the prior year, all to support the growth in project activities.\nSelling, general and administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $1.9 million, to $63.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $61.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily driven by higher personnel costs of $2.5 million and professional service costs of $1.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the prior year, to support growth in project activities. This was offset by a reduction in bad debt expense of $2.1 million due primarily to net bad debt recoveries for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to bad debt expense in the prior year.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased by $11.6 million, to $46.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $58.1 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in depreciation and amortization was primarily related to the amortization of our definite lived intangible assets, which are amortized on an accelerated basis.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, in connection with entering into the Senior Secured Credit Facilities (as defined below), the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of long-term debt of $10.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, of which $10.2 million related to unamortized loan origination fees from the credit agreement for our 2014 Senior Secured Credit Facilities (as defined below) and $0.5 million related to third party fees incurred during the fourth quarter of 2016. There was no extinguishment of long-term debt in the year ended December 31, 2017.\nMiscellaneous expense, net\nMiscellaneous expense, net decreased by $0.1 million to $0.4 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $0.4 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2016. These changes were mainly attributable to foreign exchange gains or losses that arise in connection with the revaluation of short-term inter-company balances between our domestic and international subsidiaries, gains or losses from foreign currency transactions, such as those resulting from the settlement of third-party accounts receivables and payables denominated in a currency other than the local currency of the entity making the payment and exit costs related to the previous headquarter lease.\n- 62 -\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense, net decreased by $11.8 million to $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $19.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in interest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2017 was related to the average lower outstanding balance under our Senior Secured Term Loan Facility (as defined below), as well as a lower effective interest rate as a result of the new credit agreement entered into in December 2016 (as described below).\nIncome tax provision\nIncome tax provision increased by $9.3 million, to $17.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The overall effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were 31.3% and 38.9%, respectively. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d (TCJA). The effective tax rate for 2017 decreased from 2016 primarily due to the impact from the TCJA. Excluding the impacts of the new federal tax reform legislation, our effective income tax rate in 2017 would have been an expense of 36.2%. The remaining difference was primarily attributable to the impact of state taxes, domestic and foreign uncertain tax positions and the tax impact associated with acquired tax attributes.\nThe 2017 TCJA significantly reforms the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The TCJA, among other things, includes a reduction in the U.S. federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, allows for the expensing of capital expenditures and puts into effect the migration from a worldwide\u201d system of taxation to a territorial system. The provisional impact on the year ended December 31, 2017 effective tax rate from the TCJA was primarily attributable to a one-time transition tax of $0.6 million on unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries as well as a tax benefit of $3.4 million related to the revaluation of the Deferred Credit which was partially offset by the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and other miscellaneous tax attributes due to the reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.\nWe are still evaluating the impact of the TCJA on our future effective tax rate, but at this time, we expect that the overall impact of the TCJA will decrease our effective tax rate compared to prior years.\nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared to Year ended December 31, 2015\n\n- 63 -\nService revenue, net and Reimbursed out-of-pocket revenue\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016 service revenue, net increased by $50.5 million to $370.6 million, from $320.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily driven by strong activity within the Oncology and AVAI therapeutic areas.\nReimbursed out-of-pocket revenue increased by $12.0 million to $51.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $39.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Reimbursed out-of-pocket revenues can fluctuate significantly from period to period based on the timing of program initiation or closeout, and these changes do not necessarily correlate to changes in net service revenue. The reimbursements were offset by an equal amount of reimbursed out-of-pocket expenses.\nDirect costs, excluding depreciation and amortization and Reimbursed out-of-pocket expenses\nOur direct costs, excluding depreciation and amortization increased by $34.8 million, to $198.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $163.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily attributed to increases in employee related costs for additional personnel of $23.7 million, contracted services of $4.7 million, and laboratory costs of $2.3 million, all to support the growth in project activities.\nSelling, general and administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $4.5 million, to $61.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $57.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in bad debt of $3.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher bad debt expense incurred in 2016 of approximately $1.3 million compared to 2015, and a net bad debt recovery in the year ended December 31, 2015 of $1.6 million that did not recur in 2016. The year ended December 31, 2015 also benefitted from a $1.1 million gain on litigation from the settlement of an employment matter. The costs for certain advisory and professional fees related to the IPO in 2016 resulted in increases in expenses of $0.9 million while charitable contributions increased $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year. These increases were partially offset by a $1.4 million decrease in employee related costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year. This decrease was the result of a $4.3 million one-time stock based compensation award to our Chief Executive Officer during the year ended December 31, 2015, partially offset by an increase in other employee related costs of $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nImpairment of goodwill\nThere was no impairment of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we determined that the fair value of our Clinics reporting unit did not exceed its carrying value resulting in a $9.3 million impairment of goodwill. This impairment was identified during the annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2015 when we updated our forecasted discounted cash flows to reflect operating results that lagged prior forecasted results.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased by $11.4 million, to $58.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $69.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in depreciation and amortization was primarily related to the amortization of our definite lived intangible assets, which are amortized on an accelerated basis.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, in connection with entering into the Senior Secured Credit Facilities (as defined below), the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of long-term debt of $10.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, of which $10.2 million related to unamortized loan origination fees from the credit agreement for our 2014 Senior Secured Credit Facilities (as defined below) and $0.5 million related to third party fees incurred\n- 64 -\nduring the fourth quarter of 2016. There was no extinguishment of long-term debt in the year ended December 31, 2015.\nMiscellaneous expense, net\nMiscellaneous expense, net decreased by $0.7 million to $0.4 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $1.1 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2015. These changes were mainly attributable to foreign exchange gains or losses that arise in connection with the revaluation of short-term inter-company balances between our domestic and international subsidiaries, and gains or losses from foreign currency transactions, such as those resulting from the settlement of third-party accounts receivables and payables denominated in a currency other than the local currency of the entity making the payment. Additionally, a $0.5 million gain was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2016 in connection with the settlement of certain liabilities related to a prior year change in control.\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense, net decreased by $7.9 million to $19.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $27.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in interest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily related to the lower average outstanding balance under our Senior Secured Term Loan Facility (as defined below) and 2014 Senior Secured Term Loan Facility (as defined below) compared to the prior year. Additionally, our Senior Secured Term Loan Facility, which we entered into in the fourth quarter of 2016, has a lower rate of interest compared to the 2014 Senior Secured Term Loan Facility.\nIncome tax provision\nIncome tax provision increased by $7.7 million, to $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The overall effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were 38.9% and negative 10.8%, respectively. The change in effective tax rates and the increase in income tax provision was primarily due to an increase in pre-tax book income coupled with relatively consistent year over year rate reconciliation drivers.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. Our principal sources of liquidity are operating cash flows and funds available for borrowing under our Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below). As of December 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $26.5 million, including less than $0.1 million of restricted cash, related to advanced payments received pursuant to certain sponsor contracts. Approximately $9.4 million of our cash and cash equivalents, none of which was restricted, was held by our foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017.\nOn August 16, 2016, the Company completed its IPO of its common stock at a price of $23.00 per share. We issued and sold 8,050,000 shares of common stock in the IPO. The IPO raised net proceeds of approximately $173.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions. We used the proceeds from our IPO, combined with cash on hand, to repay $175.0 million of outstanding borrowings under our 2014 Senior Secured Term Loan Facility.\nOn December 8, 2016, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the Senior Secured Credit Agreement\u201d) consisting of a $165.0 million term loan (the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility\u201d) and a $150.0 million revolving credit facility (the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility\u201d and, together with the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities\u201d). As of December 31, 2017, we had $80.0 million available for borrowing under our Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility. Proceeds from the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility were used to repay and extinguish our obligations under the 2014 Senior Secured Credit Facilities as well as pay any fees, costs and expenses related thereto.\n- 65 -\nOur expected primary cash needs on both a short and long-term basis are for investment in operational growth, capital expenditures, payment of debt, share repurchases, selective strategic bolt-on acquisitions, other investments, and other general corporate needs. We have historically funded our operations and growth with cash flow from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities. We expect to continue expanding our operations through organic growth and potentially highly selective bolt-on acquisitions and investments. We expect these activities will be funded from existing cash, cash flow from operations and, if necessary, borrowings under our existing or future credit facilities or other debt. We have deemed that foreign earnings will be indefinitely reinvested and therefore we have not provided taxes on these earnings. While we do not anticipate the need to repatriate these foreign earnings for liquidity purposes given our cash flows from operations and available borrowings under existing and future credit facilities, we would incur taxes on these earnings if the need for repatriation due to liquidity purposes arises. We believe that our sources of liquidity and capital will be sufficient to finance our cash needs for the next 12 months and on a longer-term basis. However, we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to fund our liquidity needs. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to service our indebtedness, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. See Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Relating to our Indebtedness-We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness that may not be successful\u201d in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nCash flows from operations are driven mainly by net income and net movement in accounts receivable and unbilled, net, advanced billings, pre-funded liabilities, accounts payable and accrued expenses. Accounts receivable and unbilled, net, advanced billings and pre-funded liabilities fluctuate on a regular basis as we perform our services, bill our customers and ultimately collect on those receivables. We attempt to negotiate payment terms in order to provide for payments prior to or soon after the provision of services, but this timing of collection can vary significantly on a period by period comparative basis.\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities were $97.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 consisting of net income of $39.1 million. Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities were $45.4 million, primarily related to amortization of intangibles of $37.9 million, depreciation of $8.6 million, stock based compensation expense of $4.5 million, and deferred income tax provision of $3.2 million, offset by $8.8 million of amortization and adjustment of deferred credit. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided $12.9 million in operating cash flows and were primarily driven by increased accounts payable of $4.8 million, increased advanced billings of $7.7 million, and increased pre-funded study costs of $5.3 million, offset by increased prepaid expenses and other current assets of $3.5 million.\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities was $91.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 consisting of net income of $13.4 million. Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities were $71.2 million, primarily related to amortization of intangibles of $50.7 million, depreciation of $7.4 million, loss on extinguishment of debt of $10.7 million, and stock based compensation expense of $9.8 million, offset by $9.0 million of benefit from deferred taxes. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided $7.1 million in\n- 66 -\noperating cash flows and were primarily driven by increased accrued expenses of $4.5 million primarily related to employee related costs, increased advanced billings of $14.7 million, offset by increased accounts receivable and unbilled services, net of $13.7 million, increased prepaid expenses and other current assets of $3.7 million, and a decrease in other assets and liabilities, net of $0.8 million.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $85.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, consisting of a net loss of $(8.7) million. Adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by operating activities were $90.9 million, primarily related to amortization of intangibles of $63.1 million, depreciation of $6.4 million, impairment of goodwill of $9.3 million and stock based compensation expense of $22.3 million, offset by a tax benefit of $12.7 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided $3.7 million in operating cash flows and were driven primarily by an increase in pre-funded cash and a decrease in prepaid assets, partially offset by a decrease in advanced billings.\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily consisting of property and equipment expenditures.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily consisting of property and equipment expenditures.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily consisting of property and equipment expenditures.\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $97.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily related to $155.6 million in repurchases of common stock and $42.4 million in payments on our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, offset by $100.0 million in proceeds from the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $58.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily related to $390.1 million in principal payments on our 2014 Senior Secured Term Loan Facility, offset by the IPO proceeds received of $173.6 million, and the proceeds from the issuance of debt, net of original issue discount of $164.5 million related to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. The remaining activity consisted of rental payments on deemed landlord assets, payment of debt issuance costs, and the payment of common stock issuance costs.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $116.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily related to $116.1 million in principal payments on our 2014 Senior Secured Term Loan Facility.\nShare Repurchases\nIn November 2017, the Board members who are not affiliated with Cinven (the Disinterested Directors\u201d) approved an agreement to repurchase 2,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock from Cinven in connection with a Secondary Offering (as described in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements) for aggregate consideration of approximately $60.3 million, representing a purchase price of $30.16 per share. The Company funded the repurchase with approximately $60.0 million in borrowings under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility and cash on hand.\nIn August 2017, the Disinterested Directors of the Company approved a stock repurchase agreement with Medpace Limited Partnership, a Guernsey limited partnership (the Limited Partnership\u201d acting through its general partner, Medpace GP Limited, a Guernsey company, the General Partner\u201d and, the Limited Partnership acting through the General Partner, Cinven\u201d), pursuant to which the Company repurchased 2,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock from Cinven for aggregate consideration of approximately $60.5 million, representing a purchase price of $30.27 per share. The Company funded the repurchase with cash on hand and $40.0 million in borrowings under our Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility.\n- 67 -\nIn April 2017, the Board of the Company authorized a share repurchase program with an authorized repurchase level of $50.0 million. The share repurchase program was cancelled in the fourth quarter of 2017. Repurchases under the repurchase program took place in the open market or negotiated transactions, at the discretion of the Company's management. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company repurchased 1,342,786 shares of its outstanding common stock for $34.7 million under this share repurchase program.\nThe Company has elected to constructively retire all repurchased shares with all amounts paid in excess of Common stock par value reflected within Accumulated deficit in the Company's consolidated balance sheets, except for 200,000 shares, which are reflected within treasury stock in the Company's consolidated balance sheets.\nIndebtedness\nOn December 8, 2016 (the Closing Date\u201d), Medpace IntermediateCo, Inc., as borrower (the Borrower\u201d), and Medpace Acquisition, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, as parent guarantor (the Parent Guarantor\u201d), entered into the Senior Secured Credit Agreement, which provides for the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility of $165.0 million and the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility of $150.0 million. The Senior Secured Term Loan Facility and Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility expire in December 2021. Borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities were utilized to repay and extinguish our obligations under our existing senior secured term loan facility (the 2014 Senior Secured Term Loan Facility\u201d) and our existing senior secured revolving credit facility (the 2014 Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility\u201d and, together with the 2014 Senior Secured Term Loan Facility, the 2014 Senior Secured Credit Facilities\u201d), as well as pay any related fees, costs and expenses.\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facilities are guaranteed by the Parent Guarantor and its material, direct or indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries, with certain exceptions, including where providing such guarantees is not permitted by law, regulation or contract or would result in adverse tax consequences. All of the obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities are secured, subject to certain permitted liens and other exceptions, by substantially all of the assets of the Borrower and each guarantor, including, but not limited to, a perfected pledge of all of the capital stock of the Borrower and of each guarantor (other than the Parent Guarantor) and, subject to certain exceptions, perfected security interests in substantially all other tangible and intangible assets of the Borrower and each guarantor.\nAs of December 31, 2017, there was $152.6 million outstanding under the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility and $70.0 million in borrowings outstanding under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility. In connection with entering into the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of long-term debt of $10.7 million during the fourth quarter of 2016, of which $10.2 million related to unamortized loan origination fees from the credit agreement for our 2014 Senior Secured Credit Facilities and $0.5 million related to third party fees incurred during the fourth quarter of 2016.\nBorrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities bear interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either (i) the adjusted Eurocurrency rate based on LIBOR for U.S. dollar deposits for loans denominated in dollars, EURIBOR for Euro deposits for loans denominated in Euros and the offer rate for any other currencies for loans denominated in such other currencies for the relevant interest period plus an applicable margin from 1.25% to 2.25% based on the total net leverage ratio from less than 1.50:1.00 to greater than 3.75:1:00, or (ii) an alternative base rate (determined by reference to the highest of (a) the prime commercial lending rate of the administrative agent, as established from time to time, (b) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50% and (c) the one-month adjusted Eurocurrency rate for loans in U.S. dollars plus 1.00%) plus an applicable margin from 0.25% to 1.25% based on the total net leverage ratio from less than 1.50:1.00 to greater than 3.75:1:00. The applicable margin as of December 31, 2017 was 1.25% for Eurocurrency loans and 0.25% for base rate loans. At our discretion, we may choose interest periods of one, two, three or six months, which determines the interest rate to be applied. Interest on the Eurocurrency rate loan continues to be payable at the end of the selected Eurocurrency term and interest on the base rate tranche of the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility is payable quarterly in conjunction with any required principal payments.\nWe also pay commitment fees on a quarterly basis at an annual rate of 0.375% of the unused borrowings under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility for the first full fiscal quarter after the Closing Date, and thereafter at\n- 68 -\n0.50% if the total net leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 3.00:1.00, or 0.375% if the total net leverage ratio is less than 3.00:1.00.\nThe Senior Secured Term Loan Facility will amortize in quarterly installments in aggregate annual amounts equal to (i) 7.5% of the original principal amount of the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility during the first year after the Closing Date, (ii) 10.0% of the original principal amount of the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility during the second year after the Closing Date, (iii) 10.0% of the original principal amount of the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility during the third year after the Closing Date, (iv) 12.5% of the original principal amount of the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility during the fourth year after the Closing Date and (v) 15.0% of the original principal amount of the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility during the fifth year after the Closing Date. The first amortization payment was due on March 31, 2017 and the remaining balance of the original principal amount of the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility outstanding at maturity will be paid in a final balloon payment. The Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility terminates on the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date and loans thereunder may be borrowed, repaid, and re-borrowed up to such date.\nThe following amounts are required to be prepaid in addition to quarterly installment payments and will be applied to repay the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility, subject to certain thresholds, carve-outs, exceptions and reinvestment rights: (a) to the extent that the net cash proceeds of non-ordinary course asset sales or other dispositions of property in a transaction or related transactions by the Borrower and its subsidiaries (including, without limitation, insurance and condemnation proceeds) exceeds $10 million in any fiscal year, 100% of such excess net cash proceeds; (b) 100% of the net cash proceeds of certain debt incurred by the Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries after the Closing Date; and (c) to the extent that net cash proceeds received by the Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries in connection with the disposition of any accounts receivable or related assets to a permitted receivables financing subsidiary exceeds $5 million at any time, 100% of such excess net cash proceeds. In addition to the mandatory payments above, the Borrower may voluntarily repay the outstanding Senior Secured Term Loan Facility without premium or penalty, subject to certain restrictions.\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facilities are subject to customary negative covenants that, among other things, limit the Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries to, subject to certain exceptions and carve outs:\n \u2022 create, incur or assume any lien upon any of the property, assets or revenue; \n \u2022 make or hold certain investments; \n \u2022 incur or assume any indebtedness; \n \u2022 merge, dissolve, liquidate or consolidate with or into another person; \n \u2022 make certain dispositions of property or other assets (including sale leaseback transactions); \n \u2022 declare or make certain restricted payments, including dividends; \n \u2022 enter into certain transactions with affiliates; \n \u2022 prepay subordinated debt; \n \u2022 enter into burdensome agreements; \n \u2022 engage in any material line of business substantially different from currently conducted business; or \n \u2022 change fiscal year. \nIn addition, the Borrower is required to report compliance with two financial covenants that are tested at the end of each fiscal quarter. The Borrower is required to maintain a ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness minus unrestricted cash and cash equivalents (in the aggregate not to exceed $50 million and to include not more than $25 million of foreign unrestricted cash and cash equivalents) to consolidated EBITDA for the most recent four fiscal quarter period not to exceed 4.00:1.00; provided that the Borrower shall be permitted to increase the ratio to 4.50:1.00 in connection with any permitted acquisition or any other acquisition consented to by Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Agreement) with total cash consideration in excess of $25 million. Such increase shall be applicable for the fiscal quarter in which such acquisition is\n- 69 -\nconsummated and the three consecutive test periods thereafter. The Borrower is also required to maintain a ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense, in each case for the most recent four fiscal quarter period, of not less than 3.00:1.00. The Company was in compliance with all financial covenants as of December 31, 2017.\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facilities contain certain events of default, including, among others, non-payment of principal or interest, breach of the covenants, cross default and cross acceleration to certain other indebtedness, defaults on monetary judgment orders, certain ERISA events, certain bankruptcy and insolvency events, actual or asserted invalidity of any guarantee or security document and change in control.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had total indebtedness of $222.6 million, of which $152.6 million was attributed to outstanding borrowings on the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility. There were $70.0 million in outstanding borrowings under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2017. In addition, as of December 31, 2017, we had $0.3 million in letters of credit outstanding related to certain operating lease obligations, which are secured by the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nWe have various contractual obligations, which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. Other items, such as operating lease obligations, are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed. The following table summarizes our future payments for all contractual obligations and commercial commitments for the years subsequent to the year ended December 31, 2017:\n\nThe interest payments on long-term debt in the above table are based on interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2017.\nWe have recorded a tax liability for unrecognized benefits for uncertain tax positions of $5.9 million, which has not been included in the above table due to the uncertainties in the timing of settlement of the income tax positions.\nWe are a party to certain vendor contracts related to clinical services that if cancelled may require payments for services performed and potentially additional services required to protect safety of subjects. The value of these potential wind-down provisions is generally borne by our customers and is not practical to estimate.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOff-balance sheet arrangements refer to any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity not consolidated under our entity structure exists, where we have an obligation arising under a guarantee contract, derivative instrument or variable interest or a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such an entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support for such assets. We have no off-balance sheet arrangements currently.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, or US GAAP, requires us to make a variety of decisions which affect reported amounts and related disclosures, including the selection of appropriate accounting principles and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates. In reaching such decisions, we apply judgment based on our understanding and analysis\n- 70 -\nof the relevant circumstances, including our historical experience and other assumptions. Actual results could differ from our estimates. We are committed to incorporating accounting principles, assumptions and estimates that promote the representational faithfulness, verifiability, neutrality and transparency of the accounting information included in the financial statements.\nNet Service Revenue Recognition\nWe generally enter into contracts with customers to provide services ranging in duration from a few months to several years. The contract terms generally provide for payments based on a fixed-fee or unit-of-service arrangement. Revenue on these arrangements is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the service offering has been delivered to the customer, the arrangement consideration is determinable and the collection of the fees is reasonably assured.\nA majority of our contracts provide for services based on a fixed-fee arrangement, in which revenue is recognized based on the proportional performance methodology. Under this methodology, revenue recognition is determined by assessing the proportion of performance completed or delivered to date compared to total specific measures to be delivered or completed under the terms of the arrangement. The measures utilized to assess performance are specific to the service provided, and the Company generally compares the ratio of hours completed to the total estimated hours necessary to complete the contract. A detailed project budget by hours is developed based on many factors, including, but not limited to, the scope of the work, the complexity of the study, the participating geographic locations and the Company's historical experience. We believe the reporting and estimation of hours is the best available measure of progress on many of the services provided and best reflects the pattern in which obligations to customers are fulfilled. To assist with the estimation of hours expected to complete a project, regular contract reviews for each project are performed in which performance to date is compared to the most current estimate to complete assumptions. The reviews include an assessment of effort incurred to date compared to expectations based on budget assumptions and other circumstances specific to the project. The total estimated hours necessary to complete a fixed-fee contract, based on these reviews, is updated and any revisions to the existing hours budget result in cumulative adjustments to the amount of revenue recognized in the period in which the revisions are identified. Because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating the hours necessary to fulfill contractual obligations, it is possible that estimates may change in the near term, resulting in a material change in revenue reported.\nFixed-fee contracts provide for pricing modifications upon scope of work changes. We recognize revenue related to work performed in connection with scope changes when the underlying services are performed, a binding contractual commitment has been executed with the customer and collectability is reasonably assured. If our customers do not agree to price renegotiation upon changes in our scope of work, we could be exposed to cost overruns and reduced contract profitability. Costs are not deferred in anticipation of contracts being awarded or amendments being finalized, but are expensed as incurred.\nFor unit-of-service arrangements, we recognize revenue in the period in which the unit is delivered. Service unit elements largely consist of various project management, consulting and analytical testing services.\nMany contractual arrangements combine multiple service elements. For these contracts, arrangement consideration is allocated to identified units of accounting based on the relative selling price of each unit of account. The best evidence of selling price of a unit of accounting is vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, which is the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately. When VSOE is not available to determine selling price, management uses relative third party evidence, if available. When neither VSOE nor third party evidence of selling price exists, we use the best estimate of selling price considering all relevant information that is available without undue cost and effort.\nMost contracts are terminable by the customer, either immediately or according to advance notice terms specified within the contracts. These contracts require payment of fees to us for services rendered through the date of termination and may require payment for subsequent services necessary to conclude the study or close out the contract. Final settlement amounts are typically subject to negotiation with the customer. These amounts are included in net service revenue when realization is reasonably assured. We occasionally enter into volume rebate arrangements with customers that provide for rebates if certain specified spending thresholds are met. These rebate\n- 71 -\nobligations are recorded as a reduction of revenue when it appears probable that the customer will earn the rebates and the related amount is estimable.\nWe record revenue net of any tax assessments by governmental authorities that are imposed and concurrent with specific revenue generating transactions.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe grant credit terms to our customers prior to signing a service contract and monitor creditworthiness on an ongoing basis. We assess ongoing collectability by customer through a variety of performance indicators including age of billed receivable, billing type, knowledge of available funding and other information available through internal research. A large percentage of our customers are small biopharmaceutical companies that rely on funding from investors to finance their operations. This creates a heightened risk related to their creditworthiness. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for accounts receivable specifically identified that are at risk of not being collected.\nUncollectible accounts receivable are written off only after all reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted. Moreover, in many cases the Company requires advance payment from its customers for a portion of the study contract price upon the signing of a service contract. These advance payments are deferred and recognized as revenue as services are performed.\nGoodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations. As a result of a prior year change in control, we recognized $670.3 million of goodwill that was allocated to and recorded at the reporting unit level. Our reporting units are Phase II-IV clinical research services, or Phase II-IV, Laboratories and Clinics.\nThe carrying value of goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment, or as indicators of potential impairment are identified, at the reporting unit level. We perform our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter each year, utilizing the quantitative two step model defined by accounting guidance which governs such assessments. The first step involves the comparison of each of our reporting unit carrying values, inclusive of assigned goodwill, to their respective estimated fair values. If a reporting unit carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, a second step requiring us to calculate the implied reporting unit goodwill fair value is performed. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by performing a hypothetical purchase price allocation of reporting unit fair value to the reporting units identified assets and liabilities. The resulting implied goodwill fair value is compared to carrying value to determine the extent of impairment, if any exists. Reporting unit fair value is estimated using a combination of the income approach, a discounted cash flow analysis, and the market approach, utilizing the guideline company method. The reporting unit's discounted cash flow analysis requires significant management judgment with respect to net service revenue, direct costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, selling, general and administrative expenses, capital expenditures and the selection and use of an appropriate discount rate. The projected revenue and expense assumptions and capital expenditures are based on our annual and long-term business plans. Discount rates reflect market-based estimates of the risks associated with the projected cash flows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations.\nIn conjunction with the 2015 fourth quarter annual assessment of goodwill, we determined that goodwill related to our Clinics reporting unit was impaired and we recognized an impairment charge of $9.3 million, which represents 100% of the goodwill that had been allocated to this reporting unit. This impairment was identified during the annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2015 when we updated our forecasted discounted cash flows related to the reporting unit to reflect operating results that lagged prior forecasted results. For our Phase II-IV and Laboratories reporting units, the reporting units' fair values substantially exceeded their respective carrying values including allocated goodwill. There was no indication of impairment related to goodwill based on the fourth quarter 2017 assessment.\n- 72 -\nThis process is inherently subjective and dependent upon estimates and assumptions we make. In determining our expected future cash flows, we assume that we will continue to acquire and convert new business to contract, execute on these contracts with reasonable profit, collect customer receivables and thus generate positive cash flows. However, future declines in the operating results of these reporting units could indicate a need to reevaluate the fair value of these components under accounting guidance governing goodwill and may ultimately result in future impairment. We continue to monitor for any potential indicators of impairment.\nIntangible Assets\nThe Company has an indefinite lived intangible asset related to its trade name valued at $31.6 million. The carrying value of the trade name asset is reviewed at least annually for impairment, or as indicators of potential impairment are identified. The Company performs its annual impairment test in the fourth quarter each year in conjunction with its annual assessment of goodwill. The assessment consists of comparing the carrying value of the indefinite lived intangible asset to its estimated fair value, utilizing the relief from royalty method, an income approach valuation. The relief from royalty method requires management judgment with respect to projected net service revenue, profitability and growth and the selection and use of an appropriate discount rate. There was no indication of impairment related to the trade name asset based on the fourth quarter 2017 assessment.\nOur assessment of impairment charges on any assets classified currently as having indefinite lives could change in future periods if certain events were to occur, including, but not limited to, the following: a significant change in business results, an increase in our discount rates due to a change in our weighted average cost of capital, a decrease in growth rates, economic deterioration that is more severe or longer in duration than anticipated or another significant economic event.\nFinite-lived intangible assets consist mainly of the value assigned to customer relationships, backlog and developed technologies. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized straight-line or using an accelerated method over their estimated useful lives, which range in term from 17 months to 15 years. Amortization expense recognized related to finite lived intangible assets was $37.9 million, $50.7 million and $63.1 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in the forecasting of taxable income using historical and projected future operating results in determining our provision for income taxes and the related assets and liabilities. The provision for income taxes includes income taxes paid, currently payable and receivable, and deferred taxes.\nWe record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial statement bases and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are recorded for tax benefit carryforwards using tax rates anticipated to be in effect in the year in which temporary differences are expected to reverse. If it does not appear more likely than not that the full value of a deferred tax asset will be realized, the Company records a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset, with an offsetting charge to the Company's income tax provision or benefit.\nThe recoverability of our deferred tax assets is estimated based on consideration of all available positive and negative evidence, including, but not limited to, our ability to generate a sufficient level of future taxable income, reversals of deferred tax liabilities (other than those with an indefinite reversal period), tax planning strategies and recent financial performance. The assessment of recoverability is performed on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. Based on the analysis of the above factors, we determined that as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 a valuation allowance in the amount of $2.4 million and $1.0 million, respectively, was required relating to certain foreign operating loss carryforwards, U.S. operating loss carryforwards, a U.S. capital loss carryforward and U.S. state and local operating loss carryforwards. Differences in actual results compared to our estimates and changes in our assumptions could result in an adjustment to the valuation allowance in the future and would generally impact earnings or other comprehensive income depending on the nature of the respective deferred asset for which the valuation allowance exists.\n- 73 -\nWe have recognized certain liabilities, including penalties and interest in the amount of $1.4 million as of the year ended December 31, 2017, within other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. These relate to uncertain tax positions that are subject to various assumptions and judgment. Liabilities for these uncertain tax positions are assessed on a position by position basis. The calculation of these liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in both domestic and foreign jurisdictions. These positions may be subject to audit and review by tax authorities, and may result in future taxes, interest and penalties if we are unsuccessful in defending our positions. If the calculation of liability related to uncertain tax positions proves to be more or less than the ultimate assessment, a tax expense or benefit to expense, respectively would result.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company's accounting position is that unremitted foreign earnings are indefinitely reinvested. The Company has accrued a provisional Transition Tax on the deemed repatriated earnings that were previously indefinitely reinvested. We will continue to monitor our assertion related to investment of foreign earnings and how this assertion may be impacted by the TCJA. See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding how this assertion could be impacted by the TCJA.\nStock Based Compensation\nWe have stock based compensation plans in which we issue stock based awards to employees and directors in the form of vested common shares, stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock awards (RSAs), restricted stock units (RSUs), or other cash based or stock dividend equivalent awards. All of our currently outstanding awards are subject to equity classification pursuant to the terms of the award grants and based on accounting guidance which governs such transactions. Accounting guidance applicable to equity classified awards require all stock based compensation, including vested shares, grants of employee stock options and restricted stock to be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations based on their grant date fair values.\nWe estimate the fair value of our stock options utilizing the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including: the expected stock price volatility, the calculation of the expected holding period of the award, the risk free interest rate and expected dividends on the underlying common stock. Due to the lack of Company specific historical and implied volatility data, we have based our estimate of expected volatility on the historical volatility of a group of peer companies that are most representative of our company. The historical volatility is calculated based on a period of time commensurate with the expected holding period assumption. The holding period represents the period that our option awards are expected to be outstanding. We use the simplified method as prescribed by accounting guidance governing such awards, to calculate the expected term for options granted to employees as we do not have sufficient historical evidence data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected holding period. This simplified method utilizes the mid-point between the vesting date and the date of the contractual term. The risk free rate is based on extrapolated rates of U.S. Treasury bonds whose terms are consistent with the expected holding period of the stock options. We have assumed a dividend yield of zero as we have not historically paid any dividends on our common stock.\nAll our stock based option awards are subject to service based vesting conditions. Compensation expense related to stock option awards to employees is recognized on a straight line basis based on the grant date fair value over the associated service period of the award, which is equal to the vesting term.\nThe following table summarizes the key weighted average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to calculate the fair value of options during the periods:\n\n- 74 -\nThe assumptions used in the table above reflect both grant date inputs to arrive at the grant date fair values for stock options subject to equity-classified stock compensation accounting and reflect a fair value calculation for stock options outstanding in the period subject to liability-classified stock compensation accounting. As of December 31, 2017 all outstanding stock based awards were subject to equity classification through either modifications of the award terms and conditions that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2017, or based on terms and conditions applicable as of the grant date.\nThe weighted average grant date fair value of employee stock options granted was $8.54, $6.91 and $3.81 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nEffect of Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for management's discussion of the effect

on the company's financial condition and operating results, to be read alongside its consolidated financial statements. The company is a leading clinical contract research organization (CRO) focused on full-service Phase I-IV clinical development services. It prides itself on its therapeutic expertise, global presence, and a disciplined operating model. An important recent development includes the asset acquisition of NephroGenex, primarily for its tax attributes, which was accounted for as an asset purchase with a value of $22.2 million recognized mainly from deferred tax assets.\n\nRevenue is generated from net service revenue and reimbursed-out-of-pocket revenue. Net service revenue is recognized using a performance methodology or as services are delivered, with contracts including upfront fees and scheduled billings over the contract duration. Revenue can be impacted by new business volume, project cancellations, and the mix of active studies. Costs are mainly driven by labor, including employee benefits, lab supplies, and direct service costs. Expenses include direct costs, SG&A, depreciation, and amortization.\n\nThe company faces risks, such as exchange rate fluctuations (significant amounts are denominated in the Euro), which can impact financials. The income tax provision includes federal, state, and local taxes and is influenced by various factors such as tax laws, credits, non-deductible expenses, and tax rates in different jurisdictions. A key performance metrics is the net new business awards and backlog, indicative of future revenue, and this can fluctuate significantly.\n\nThe company's financial strategy includes managing liquidity by generating cash from operations and using borrowing facilities. As of December 31, 2017, cash and cash equivalents were $26.5 million. An IPO and subsequent share repurchases were significant financing activities, alongside the establishment of a new credit agreement consisting of a $165 million term loan and a $150 million revolving credit facility.\n\nOperating cash flows are influenced by net income, account receivables, billings, and other assets and liabilities. Investing activities primarily involve property and equipment expenditures, while financing activities reflect common stock repurchases, debt payments, and IPO proceeds.\n\nAccounting policies and critical estimates play a significant role in financial reporting, affecting revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, and income taxes. The financial statements are subject to various subjective assumptions and estimates, including those related to future business performance, interest rates, tax positions, and stock-based compensation. Any changes in these assumptions or estimates could significantly impact the company's financial statements.\n\nFinally, the company has contractual obligations such as long-term debt, operating lease obligations, and deemed landlord liabilities, outlining payments due by period. The ability to manage these and other financial commitments is critical for ongoing liquidity and long-term health."}
