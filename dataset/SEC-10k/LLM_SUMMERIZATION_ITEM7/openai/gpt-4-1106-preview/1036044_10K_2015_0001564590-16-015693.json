Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report under the heading Risk Factors,\u201d which are incorporated herein by reference. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. We assume no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\nEach of the terms the Company,\u201d Identiv,\u201d we\u201d and us\u201d as used herein refers collectively to Identiv, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated.\nOverview\nIdentiv is a global security technology company that secures data, physical places and things. Global organizations in the government, education, retail, transportation, healthcare and other markets rely upon our solutions. We empower them to create safe, secure, validated and convenient experiences in schools, government offices, factories, transportation, hospitals and virtually every type of facility and for every type of product.\nAt the beginning of September 2013, we undertook a strategic review of our business and initiated a series of actions to simplify our business structure and streamline our operations. Following the changes in our organizational structure, we changed our operating segments to focus on the following solutions:\nTable 76: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Premises solutions securing buildings via an integrated access control system.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 77: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Information solutions securing enterprise information including PCs, networks, email encryption, login, and printers via delivery of smart card reader products and identity management via our idOnDemand service.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Everyday items solutions securing connected items, including electronic toys, medical devices, wearables and other internet of things applications\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe foundation of our business are our expertise in RFID and access control, our close customer relationships that allow us to develop customer-relevant products, and our core value of quality.\nTo deliver these solutions, the Company has organized its operations into four reportable business segments, principally by product families: Premises, Identity, Credentials and All Other.\nPremises\nThe foundation of our premises business is the Hirsch line of controllers including the advanced MX line, Hirsch's Velocity management software and our ICPAM software, EDGE controller and reader package. Our modular Hirsch MX controllers are designed to be scalable, allowing customers to start with a small system and expand over time. Hirsch MX controllers can operate autonomously, whether as a single controller or as part of a networked system with Velocity software. The Hirsch Velocity software platform enables centralized management of access and security operations across an organization, including control of doors, gates, turnstiles, elevators and other building equipment, monitoring users as they move around a facility, preventing unwanted access, maintaining compliance and providing a robust audit trail.\nuTrust door readers provide unique features to support a number of security environments and standards. For example, uTrust TS readers support the majority of legacy card credentials with a robust next-generation platform that can help companies migrate to more secure credentials and technologies, including smart cards, near field communication ( NFC\u201d) and government-issued credentials. uTrust Scramblepad readers employ numerical scrambling on the keypad to protect access codes from being stolen as they are entered.\nIdentity\nOur Identity products include smart card readers, which includes a broad range of contact, contactless, portable and mobile smart card readers, tokens and terminals that are utilized around the world to enable logical (i.e., PC, network or data) access and security and identification applications, such as national ID, payment, e-Health and e-Government.\nRelated to our reader product line, we are a leading provider in the definition and provisioning of access cards and other devices to allow users to conveniently and securely access their facilities and resources, and to empower facilities and security administrators to deploy exactly the solutions they want to provide the optimal mix of cost, security and convenience to their user community, whether students, hospital patients, military and government personnel, consumers or a vast array of users.\nCredentials\nOur Credentials products include NFC and radio frequency identification ( RFID\u201d) products - including inlays and inlay-based cards - labels, tags and stickers, as well as other radio frequency ( RF\u201d) and IC components. These products are manufactured in our state-of-the-art facility in Singapore and are used in a diverse range of physical applications, including electronic entertainment games, loyalty cards, mobile payment systems, transit and event ticketing, and brand authenticity from pharmaceuticals to consumer goods, hospital resource management and many others.\nLeveraging our expertise in RFID, physical access and physical authentication, we're developing new solutions to extend our platforms across a wide variety of physical use cases. The next major opportunity in our connected world is the Internet of things, which fundamentally is about physical things. We believe our core strength in physical access and physical instrumentation (RFID) markets, our well-established platforms and our deep knowledge of the relevant technologies, position us well in this growth market.\nAll Other\nThe All Other segment includes products, such as Chipdrive and Digital Media readers. The products included in the All Other segment do not meet the quantitative thresholds for determining reportable segments and therefore have been combined for reporting purposes.\nWe primarily conduct sales and marketing activities in each of the markets in which we compete, utilizing our own sales and marketing organization to solicit prospective channel partners and customers, provide technical advice and support with respect to products, systems and services, and manage relationships with customers, distributors and/or original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs\u201d). We utilize indirect sales channels that may include OEMs, dealers, systems integrators, value added resellers, resellers or Internet sales, although we also sell directly to end users. In support of our sales efforts, we participate in industry events and conduct sales training courses, targeted marketing programs, and ongoing customer, channel partner and third-party communications programs.\nOur corporate headquarters are located in Fremont, California. We maintain research and development facilities in California, and Chennai, India, and local operations and sales facilities in Australia, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Singapore and the U.S. We were founded in 1990 in Munich, Germany and incorporated in 1996 under the laws of the State of Delaware.\nFor a discussion of our net revenue by segment and geographic location, see Note 10, Segment Reporting and Geographic Information in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nRecent Developments in our Business\nIn September 2013, we undertook a strategic review of our business and initiated a series of actions to simplify our business structure and streamline our operations.\nThe first of these actions was to realign our organizational structure to operate as a single, unified company rather than as a group of individual businesses. This change in our structure enhances our ability to coordinate and focus our strategic and operational activities. To signal this change, we implemented a new corporate identity using the word mark and logo Identiv\u201d in place of Identive Group.\u201d We also reorganized our management team and our operational activities by function (e.g., engineering, sales, marketing, customer service and information technology), allowing centralized management of key activities on a global basis. With the reorganization of and changes to our management team, we moved our executive headquarters to Fremont, California and relocated our operational and certain administrative activities from Ismaning, Germany to our facility in Santa Ana, California.\nAnother important action was the divestiture of businesses that were determined to be non-core to our ongoing strategy. In December 2013 we completed the sale of our Multicard and payment solution subsidiaries in Europe. In February 2014 we completed\nthe sale of our Multicard subsidiary in the U.S. and in July 2014, we sold certain non-core assets related to one of our U. S. based subsidiaries. We have accounted for these divested businesses as discontinued operations, and the statements of operations for all periods presented reflect the discontinuance of these businesses. For more information, see Note 2 Discontinued Operations in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nStarting in 2014, our operating segments align to our current market strategy. We reported our financial results under these segments beginning with our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2014.\nOur Strategy\nOur corporate priority is to drive revenue growth by leveraging our core expertise from our existing product portfolio, as well as our significant experience addressing customers' security challenges across multiple markets, including the government, transportation, healthcare, education, banking, critical infrastructure and others.\nTrends in our Business\nGeographic net revenue, based on each customer's ship-to location, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 is as follows:\nTable 79: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Americas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 40,848\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 51,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Europe and the Middle East\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asia-Pacific\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,474\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 60,794\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 81,249\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Americas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Europe and the Middle East\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asia-Pacific\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Revenue Trends\nNet revenue in 2015 was $60.8 million, down 25% compared with $81.2 million in 2014. Approximately 45% of our net revenue came from our Credentials segment. Net revenue in our Credentials segment in 2015 was $27.3 million compared to $41.6 million in 2014. Net revenue in our Premises segment in 2015 was $20.0 million compared to $19.0 million in 2014 reflecting a rebound in activity related to U.S. Government entities, which was weak in 2014. The growth in our Premises segment net revenue was more than offset by a 30% decline in net revenue in our Identity segment. The net revenue decline in our Identity segment reflects continued weakness in sales of smart card readers within Europe and the Middle East where sales activity has declined due to continuing economic uncertainty in the region. Premises products accounted for 33% of our business in 2015 and our Identity products accounted for 20% of our net revenue.\nNet revenue in the Americas. Net revenue in the Americas was $40.8 million in 2015, accounting for 67% of total net revenue and down 20% compared with $51.3 million in 2014. Net revenue from physical access control solutions for security programs within various U.S. Government agencies, as well as RFID and NFC products, inlays and tags comprise a significant proportion of our net revenue in the Americas region.\nNet revenue from our Premises segment in the Americas increased by approximately 8% in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to an increase in orders for physical access control solutions from federal and state agency customers. Net revenue from our Identity segment in the Americas remained relatively stable in 2015 compared to 2014. Net revenue from our Credentials segment in the Americas declined 35% in 2015 compared to 2014. The Credential segment net revenue decrease was primarily due to the timing of orders in North America for electronic game toy pieces and other Internet of Things applications.\nAs a general trend, U.S. Federal agencies continue to be subject to security improvement mandates under programs such as Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 and reiterated in memoranda from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB M-11-11). We believe that our physical access control solutions is an attractive offering in the market to help agencies move towards compliance with federal directives and mandates. To expand our sales opportunities in the United States in general and with orders\nsourced from U.S. Government agencies in particular, we have strengthened our U.S. sales organization and reopened a sales presence in Washington D.C.\nNet revenue in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia-Pacific. Net revenue in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia-Pacific was $19.9 million in 2015, accounting for 33% of total net revenue and down 33% from $29.9 million in 2014. Net revenue in these regions are very dependent on the completion of large projects and the timing of orders placed by some of our larger customers. Sales of Identity readers and RFID and NFC products and tags comprise a significant proportion of our net revenue in these regions.\nNet revenue from our Identity products decreased by approximately 40% in 2015 compared to 2014, as 2014 included the completion of a large order to a significant customer in Germany as well as large orders from two significant customers in Asia. In 2015, we did not see a repeat of these major orders as these customers had recently placed significant fourth quarter 2014 orders. Identity readers comprise approximately 38% of the net revenue throughout these regions in 2015. Net revenue from our Credentials products, which comprise approximately 41% of the sales in these regions, declined by approximately 32% in 2015 compared to 2014 as sales in Europe have been negatively impacted by the transfer of local production of NFC inlays and tags to Singapore following the end of the second quarter of 2014. Net revenue from our Premises products decreased by 13% in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily driven by the completion of projects in the Middle East involving our physical access control solutions in 2014.\nSeasonality and Other Factors. In our business overall, we may experience significant variations in demand for our offerings from quarter to quarter, and typically experience a stronger demand cycle in the second half of our fiscal year. Sales of our premises solutions to U.S. Government agencies are subject to annual government budget cycles and generally are highest in the third quarter of each year. However, the usual seasonal trend can be negatively impacted by actions such as government shutdowns and the passing of continuing resolutions which can act to delay the completion of certain projects. Sales of our identity reader chips, many of which are sold to government agencies worldwide, are impacted by testing and compliance schedules of government bodies as well as roll-out schedules for application deployments, both of which contribute to variability in demand from quarter to quarter. Further, this business is typically subject to seasonality based on differing commercial and global government budget cycles. Lower sales are expected in the U.S. in the first half, and in particular the first quarter of the year, with higher sales typically in the second half of each year. In Asia and Australia, with fiscal year-ends in March and June, order demand can be high in the first half as customers attempt to complete projects before the end of the fiscal year. Accordingly, our net revenue levels in the first quarter and first half each year often depends on the relative strength of project completions and sales mix between our U.S. customer base and our International customer base.\nIn addition to the general seasonality of demand, overall U.S. Government expenditure patterns have a significant impact on demand for our products due to the significant portion of revenues that are typically sourced from U.S. Government agencies. Therefore, any significant reduction in U.S. Government spending could adversely impact our financial results and could cause our operating results to fall below any guidance we provide to the market or below the expectations of investors or security analysts.\nOperating Expense Trends\nBase Operating Expenses\nOur base operating expenses (i.e. research and development, selling and marketing, and general and administrative spending) increased 22% in 2015 compared to 2014. Research and development spending increased by 33% in 2015 compared to 2014, mainly due to the transfer of existing employees into research and development and the addition of new employees, leading to higher payroll costs, and travel expenses, as well as higher costs for external services and contractors. Selling and marketing spending in 2015 were down by 2% compared to 2014, due to the stabilization of sales and marketing organization headcount and marketing program spending. General and administrative spending in 2015 increased 54% from 2014 due to a large increase in legal and professional fees and increases in stock-based compensation in 2015.\nSimplification and Streamlining of our Business\nIn September 2013, we undertook a strategic review of our business and initiated a series of actions to simplify our business structure and streamline our operations. As a consequence of our strategic review in late 2013 and early 2014, we disposed of non-core or under-performing businesses, including our Multicard AG, payment solution AG, Multicard Nederland BV and Multicard U.S. subsidiaries. Additionally, we ceased any additional investment in the Tagtrail mobile services platform. To further simplify our business and streamline our operations, we restructured our organization to operate as a single, unified company rather than as a group of individual businesses. This restructuring included the realignment of our management team and our operational activities by function (for example engineering, sales, marketing, customer service and information technology). With the centralization of various functions, we also eliminated several redundant positions. Additionally, we completed the process of transferring various functions, such as corporate financial accounting and reporting from Germany to the U.S., in the third quarter of 2014.\nTo streamline production and operations in our Credentials business, we initiated the closure of our German production facility for RFID and NFC inlays, tags, and labels to consolidate production in our facility in Singapore. The closure of this production facility was completed in the second quarter of 2014. We have in the past expanded production capacity with the addition of production and assembly lines at our existing facility in California and via partnerships with external manufacturers, and we are planning to further invest in our card production capabilities. Additionally, we continue to invest in enhancements to our data center infrastructure to support the expected growth of our cloud service offerings.\nIn addition to the initiatives noted above, on January 27, 2016, we commenced the implementation of a worldwide restructuring plan designed to refocus resources on our core business segments, including physical access and transponders, and to further consolidate our operations in several worldwide locations. The restructuring plan includes a reduction of approximately 25% of our non-manufacturing employee base, reallocating overhead roles into direct business activities and the elimination of certain management and executive roles. See Note 11, Restructuring and Severance, and Note 15, Subsequent Events, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information.\nRestructuring and Severance\nAs a result of the actions discussed above, certain employees related to non-core functions were terminated. In the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded $3.1 million in restructuring, severance and other closure related costs. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded $1.3 million in severance costs primarily related to restructuring within our sales and marketing organization in conjunction with recent corporate restructuring and cost reduction activities.\nIn connection with the January 2016 restructuring initiatives, we estimate that we will incur aggregate cash charges of approximately $1.6 million to $2.0 million, consisting of approximately $1.5 million to $1.75 million related to severance payments to employees and approximately $100,000 to $250,000 in lease termination fees. The majority of the charges are expected to be paid out during the first quarter of 2016.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table includes segment net revenue and segment net profit information by business segment and reconciles gross profit to results of continuing operations before income taxes and noncontrolling interest. The results for 2015 and 2014 have been adjusted for divested businesses as discussed in Note 2 Discontinued Operations, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nTable 80:

Compared with Fiscal 2014\nNet Revenue\nNet revenue in 2015 was $60.8 million, down 25% compared with $81.2 million in 2014. Net revenue was lower in 2015 primarily reflecting lower sales in our Identity, Credentials and All Other segments, partially offset by higher sales in our Premises segment. A more detailed discussion of revenues by segment follows below.\nOur products are sold to end customers in the government, enterprise and commercial markets to address vertical market segments including public services administration, military and defense, law enforcement, healthcare, education, banking, industrial, retail and critical infrastructure.\nIn our Premises segment, we provide solutions and services that enable the issuance, management and use of secure identity credentials in diverse markets. Our Premises segment includes products to secure buildings via an integrated access control system, and includes MX controllers, Velocity management software and TS door readers. Our modular Hirsch MX controllers are designed to be scalable, allowing customers to start with a small system and expand over time. Hirsch MX controllers can operate autonomously, whether as a single controller or as part of a networked system with Velocity software. The Hirsch Velocity software platform enables centralized management of access and security operations across an organization, including control of doors, gates, turnstiles, elevators and other building equipment, monitoring users as they move around a facility, preventing unwanted access, maintaining compliance and providing a robust audit trail. uTrust door readers provide unique features to support a number of security environments and standards. For example, uTrust Scramblepad readers employ numerical scrambling on the keypad to protect access codes from being stolen as they are entered. uTrust TS readers support the majority of legacy card credentials with a robust next-generation platform that can help companies migrate to more secure credentials and technologies, including smart cards, NFC and government-issued credentials. Because of the complex nature of the problems we address for our Premises solutions customers, pricing pressure is not prevalent in this segment.\nNet revenue in our Premises segment was $20.0 million in 2015, an increase of 5% from $19.0 million in 2014. The increase in 2015 primarily was due to higher sales of physical access control solutions in the U.S., resulting from higher overall demand from U.S. Government customers compared to 2014.\nIn our Identity segment, we offer products to secure enterprise information, including PCs, networks, email encryption, login, and printers via delivery of smart card reader products and identity management via our idOnDemand service. Identiv offers smart card readers - a broad range of contact, contactless and mobile smart card readers, tokens and terminals - to enable logical (i.e., PC, network or data) access and security and identification applications, such as national ID, payment, e-Health and e-Government. Our idOnDemand service can be used to provision (i.e., create and issue) and manage identity credentials.\nNet revenue in our Identity segment was $12.0 million in 2015, a decrease of 30% from $17.0 million in 2014. This decrease in Identity segment net revenue in 2015 was primarily the result of significant orders being received in 2014 from our German and Asian customers which were not repeated in 2015, and also reflects continuing economic uncertainty in the international markets we do business in as well as the negative impact of a strong U.S. dollar in 2015 compared to 2014.\nIn our Credentials segment, we offer access cards and RFID and NFC products, including cards, inlays, labels, tags and stickers, as well as other RF components. These products are manufactured in our state-of-the-art facility in Singapore and are used in a diverse range of identity-based applications, including electronic entertainment, loyalty schemes, mobile payment, transit and event ticketing. In our RFID and NFC product business, there is a trend towards a higher overall average selling price as we sell a higher proportion of finished tickets and tags in addition to our inlays. The margins for access cards have been relatively stable.\nNet revenue in our Credentials segment was $27.3 million in 2015, down 34% from $41.6 million in 2014. The Credential net revenue decrease in 2015 was primarily due to the timing of the receipt of orders in North America and Europe for electronic game toy pieces and other Internet of Things applications.\nThe All Other segment includes sales of our Chipdrive brand and Digital Media reader products.\nNet revenue in our All Other segment was $1.5 million in 2015, down 57% from $3.6 million in 2014. Digital Media reader product sales were down significantly in 2015 compared to 2014 and are expected to remain at low levels as certain customers are expected to exit this business.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for 2015 was $23.1 million, or 38% of revenues, compared to $33.5 million or 41% of revenues in 2014. Gross profit represents revenues less direct cost of product sales, manufacturing overhead, other costs directly related to preparing the product for sale including freight, scrap, inventory adjustments and amortization, where applicable. Gross profit margins were down in 2015 primarily related to product mix with significantly higher sales in our lower-margin segments and inventory write downs and reserve adjustments.\nIn our Premises segment, gross profit on sales of physical access control solutions, including panels, controllers, and access readers was $11.5 million in 2015 and $11.4 million in 2014. Gross profit was higher in 2015 as a direct result of higher sales in the Premises segment in 2014. Gross profit margins in the Premises segment were relatively stable ranging from 58% in 2015 to 60% in 2014.\nIn our Identity segment, gross profit on sales of information readers and modules as well as cloud-based credential provisioning and management services was $5.0 million in 2015 compared to $8.2 million in 2014. Gross profit was lower in 2015 as a direct result of lower sales in the Identity segment in 2014. Gross profit margins in the Identity segment were lower in 2015 at 42% compared to 48% in 2014 due to product mix and the negative impact of absorbing fixed overhead over a smaller revenue base in the period.\nIn our Credentials segment, gross profit on sales of RFID & NFC inlays and tags was $5.6 million in 2015 and $11.9 million in 2014. Gross profit was lower in 2015 as a direct result of higher sales of transponders in the Credentials segment in 2014. Gross profit margins in the Credentials segment decreased from 29% in 2014 to 21% in 2015.\nWe expect there will be some variation in our gross profit from period to period, as our gross profit has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including, without limitation, competition, product pricing, the volume of sales in any given quarter, manufacturing volumes, product configuration and mix, the availability of new products, product enhancements, software and services, risk of inventory write-downs and the cost and availability of components.\nOperating Expenses\nInformation about our operating expenses for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 is set forth below.\nResearch and Development\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,249\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of employee compensation and fees for the development of hardware, software and firmware products. We focus the bulk of our research and development activities on the continued development of existing products and the development of new offerings for emerging market opportunities.\nResearch and development expenses were higher in 2015 primarily due to the transfer of existing employees into research and development and the addition of new employees, leading to higher payroll costs and travel expenses, as well as higher costs for external services and contractors in 2015.\nSelling and Marketing\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling and marketing expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,635\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (399\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.9\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee compensation as well as amortization expense of certain intangible assets, tradeshow participation, advertising and other marketing and selling costs.\nThe level of selling and marketing expenses represents the stabilization of sales and marketing organization headcount and marketing program spending resulting from actions begun in 2013 to simplify our business structure and streamline our operations.\nGeneral and Administrative\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 53.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation expenses for employees performing administrative functions, and professional fees incurred for legal, auditing and other consulting services.\nGeneral and administrative spending in 2015 increased from 2014 due to a large increase in legal and professional fees and increases in stock-based compensation.\nEarn-out and Impairment Charges\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Earn-out consideration\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,510\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,510\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment of goodwill\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement entered into on April 29, 2011 between the selling stockholders of idOnDemand, Inc. (the idOnDemand Agreement\u201d) and us, we accrued an earn-out obligation for the year ended December 31, 2014. The estimated earn-out consideration was calculated based on the achievement of specific financial and sales performance targets as defined in the idOnDemand Agreement. The earn-out consideration liability was settled during the quarter ended June 30, 2015 by the issuance of common stock to the selling shareholders.\nAs detailed in Note 6, Goodwill and Intangible Assets in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements, under our accounting policy, we are required to perform an annual impairment review of our goodwill and an interim analysis of our long-lived assets, when there are changes in our business that may indicate impairment of those assets.\nDuring the second quarter of 2015, we noted certain indicators of impairment, including a sustained decline in the price of our common stock and continued reduced performance in our Identity reporting unit. Based on the results of step one of the goodwill impairment analysis, we determined that the net adjusted carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value of the Identity reporting unit. As a result, we concluded that the carrying value of goodwill for our Identity reporting unit was fully impaired and recorded an impairment charge of approximately $1.0 million in our consolidated statements of operations during the second quarter of 2015.\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2015, our stock price declined significantly which resulted in a significant reduction in our fair value and market capitalization. The stock price declined from $3.64 as of October 1, 2015 to $1.99 as of December 31, 2015, and subsequently dropped further, reaching a low of $1.56 in February 2016. Additionally, our net losses continued in the quarter ended December 31, 2015, and we announced a worldwide restructuring plan designed to refocus resources on our core business segments and to consolidate operations in several worldwide locations. As a result, we performed an impairment test and determined that our goodwill was fully impaired based on qualitative factors as the net fair value of the company exceeded its carrying value. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $7.8 million in our consolidated statement of operations in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nIn December 2014, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and found no potential indicators of impairment. In addition, our assessments of long-lived assets during 2015 and 2014 found no indicators of impairment during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nRestructuring and Severance Charges\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restructuring and severance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,832\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (59.1\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2014, certain employees related to non-core functions were terminated, the process of transferring corporate financial accounting and reporting from Germany to the U.S. commenced and certain manufacturing facilities were scheduled to close with activities consolidated within existing facilities. As a result, we recorded restructuring and severance charges of $3.1 million primarily related to restructuring, severance and other closure related costs in 2014. During 2015, we recorded an additional $1.3 million in severance costs, as part of management's continuing efforts to simplify business operations.\nSee Note 11, Restructuring and Severance in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information.\nNon-operating Income (Expense)\nInformation about our non-operating income (expense) for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 is set forth below.\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,908\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,619\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (47.3\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Foreign currency (loss) gain, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,211\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,270\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.6\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net consists of interest on financial liabilities and interest accretion expense for a liability to a former related party arising from our acquisition of Hirsch Electronics Corporation ( Hirsch\u201d), offset by interest earned on invested cash. The higher net interest expense in 2014 is due to our entry into a bank term loan and revolving loan facility on March 31, 2014 with Opus Bank ( Opus\u201d) and repayment of all outstanding amounts under the secured debt facility with Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc. ( Hercules\u201d). In connection with the repayment of our secured debt facility with Hercules, we recorded a $1.6 million charge to interest expense in 2014 in our consolidated statement of operations. The $1.6 million charge to interest expense included $0.9 million related to write-off of deferred costs, $0.6 million related to write-off of discounts on the secured note and $0.1 million related to prepayment fees as stipulated in the Hercules agreement and forfeiture of a facility charge paid at the inception of the agreement.\nSee Note 7, Long-Term Payment Obligation and Note 8, Financial Liabilities in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information on our interest expense and financial obligations.\nForeign Currency (Losses) Gains, Net\nWe recorded net foreign currency losses of $1.2 million and $1.3 million in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Changes in currency valuation in the periods mainly were the result of exchange rate movements between the U.S. dollar and the euro and the Swiss franc and their impact on the valuation of intercompany transaction balances. Accordingly, they are predominantly non-cash items. Our foreign currency gains and losses primarily result from the valuation of current assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the respective entity in the local financial statements.\nIncome Taxes\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax provision\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (222\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (95\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (127\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 133.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amount of income (loss) we earn in jurisdictions, which we expect to be fairly consistent in the near term. It is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year, but are not consistent from year to year. The following items had the most significant impact on the difference between our statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of 34% and our effective tax rate in fiscal years 2015 and 2014.\n2015 - A reduction of $11.7 million, or 30.1% to the statutory rate resulted from changes in valuation allowance during the year. A reduction of $2.6 million, or 6.8% resulted from the impairment of goodwill, and an addition of $1.3 million, or 3.5% resulted from rate differences between U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions. No U.S. taxes were provided with respect to undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as these earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. Significant jurisdictions causing this difference are Germany and Singapore. The net effect of all changes was an income tax expense of $0.1 million recorded in 2015.\n2014 - A reduction of $3.9 million, or 27.0% to the statutory rate resulted from changes in valuation allowance during the year, A reduction of $1.1 million, or 6.8% resulted from the settlement of the earn-out consideration liability, and a reduction of $0.9 million, or 5.5%, resulted from rate differences between U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions. No U.S. taxes were provided with respect to undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as these earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. Significant jurisdictions causing this difference are Germany and Singapore. The net effect of all changes was an income tax expense of $0.1 million recorded in 2014.\nDiscontinued Operations\nIn November 2013, we committed to a plan to sell our Multicard US business and completed the sale of this business on February 4, 2014. Additionally, we entered into an asset purchase agreement to sell certain non-core assets related to one of our subsidiaries to a former employee in June 2014 and completed the sale of these non-core assets in July 2014. All of these businesses (collectively, our divested businesses\u201d) have been accounted for as discontinued operations in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nNo net revenue was recorded for the divested businesses in 2015 and $1.3 million was recorded in 2014. No income from discontinued operations before income taxes was recorded in 2015 and $0.5 million was recorded in 2014.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2015, our working capital, defined as current assets less current liabilities, was $25.1 million, a decrease of $16.9 million compared to $42.0 million as of December 31, 2014. The decrease in working capital reflects a net loss of $39.2 million and changes in operating assets and liabilities negatively impacting our liquidity of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, partially offset by non-cash adjustments of $17.5 million. As of December 31, 2015, our cash balance was $16.7 million.\nThe following summarizes our cash flows for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (23,003\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (11,733\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (341\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,131\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41,909\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of exchange rates on cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net decrease in cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (19,880\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash, beginning of year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Add: Cash of discontinued operations, at beginning of year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: Cash of discontinued operations, end of year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash, end of year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSignificant commitments that will require the use of cash in future periods include obligations under operating leases, our contractual payment obligation assumed upon our acquisition of Hirsch, secured note and revolver, purchase commitments and other obligations. Gross committed operating lease obligations are $4.1 million, our contractual payment obligation assumed upon our acquisition of Hirsch is $6.7 million, the bank term loan, revolving loan facility and interest related obligation is $19.7 million, and purchase commitments and other obligations are $8.2 million at December 31, 2015. Total commitments due within one year are $9.0 million and due thereafter are $29.7 million at December 31, 2015. These commitment levels are based on existing terms of our operating leases, obligations with suppliers, our contractual payment obligation and the existing credit agreement with Opus as of December 31, 2015.\nCash used in operating activities for 2015 primarily was due to the net loss of $39.2 million and decreases in cash from net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $1.3 million which was partially offset by adjustments for certain non-cash items of $17.5 million which primarily consisted of impairment of goodwill, depreciation, amortization, amortization of debt issue costs and stock-based compensation. For 2014, cash used in operating activities primarily was due to the net loss of $17.9 million and a decrease in cash from net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $4.9 million, which were partially offset be adjustments for certain non-cash items of $11.1 million.\nCash used in investing activities for 2015 reflects $0.3 million in capital expenditures. For 2014, cash provided by investing activities reflects $1.4 million in proceeds on sale of discontinued operations, offset by $1.3 million in capital expenditures.\nCash provided by financing activities reflects an additional $4.0 million in proceeds from debt borrowings less cash used to repurchase common stock of $1.9 million. For the year ended December 31, 2014, cash provided by financing activities primarily reflects $14.3 million net cash proceeds from borrowings of debt, less repayments to Opus and $35.8 million net cash proceeds from sales of common stock, partially offset by cash payments of $6.7 million for financial liabilities related to a debt facility repaid in full on March 31, 2014 and $1.7 million for the repurchase of common stock during the year.\nWe consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, if any, as of December 31, 2015, to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no U.S. income taxes have been provided thereon. Generally most of our foreign subsidiaries have accumulated deficits and cash and cash equivalents that are held outside the United States are typically not cash generated from earnings that would be subject to tax upon repatriation if transferred to the United States. We have access to the cash held outside the United States to fund domestic operations and obligations without any material income tax consequences. As of December 31, 2015, the amount of cash included at such subsidiaries was $2.2 million. We have not, nor do we anticipate the need to, repatriate funds to the United States to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business, including liquidity needs associated with our domestic debt service requirements.\nOn October 30, 2012, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the Loan Agreement\u201d) with Hercules. The Loan Agreement provided for a term loan in aggregate principal amount of up to $10.0 million with an initial drawdown of $7.5 million. The initial drawdown of $7.5 million was secured by a secured term promissory note dated October 30, 2012. As discussed below, we repaid all outstanding amounts under the Loan Agreement in connection with the closing of the Credit Agreement with Opus on\nMarch 31, 2014. See Note 8 Financial Liabilities in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information.\nOn April 16, 2013, we entered into a purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement\u201d) with LPC, pursuant to which we have the right to sell to LPC up to $20 million in shares of our common stock, subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement. We directed LPC to purchase 496,500 shares of common stock from January 1, 2014 through September 30, 2014 for net consideration of $4.2 million. See Note 4 Stockholders' Equity, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information.\nOn March 31, 2014, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) with Opus. The Credit Agreement provides for a term loan in the aggregate principal amount of $10.0 million ( Term Loan\u201d) which was drawn down on March 31, 2014, and an additional $10.0 million revolving loan facility ( Revolving Loan Facility\u201d), of which $4.0 million was drawn down on March 31, 2014 and an additional $2.0 million was drawn down during the three months ended June 30, 2014. In connection with the closing of the Credit Agreement, we repaid all outstanding amounts under the Loan Agreement with Hercules. The proceeds of the Term Loan and the initial loans under the Revolving Loan Facility, after payment of fees to Opus and expenses and all outstanding amounts under the Loan Agreement, were approximately $7.8 million. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all assets of the Company. On November 10, 2014 and on December 4, 2015, we amended the Credit Agreement with Opus (the Amended Credit Agreement\u201d) which changes a number of terms of the Credit Agreement including interest charged, the monthly installment payment schedule, the maximum amount available under the revolving loan facility and the maturity date as well as certain other terms and conditions. See Note 8 Financial Liabilities, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information.\nOn December 4, 2015, we entered into an amendment (the Credit Amendment\u201d) to our Credit Agreement with Opus. The Credit Amendment amended and restated Section 7.11(a) Financial Covenants to read as follows: Tangible Net Worth. Permit the sum of the Consolidated Tangible Net Worth plus the amount shown on the Borrower's current balance sheet for the 1994 Settlement Agreement to be less than the sum of $8,000,000 plus, an amount equal to 50% of the amount of any Cash proceeds from any equity or Subordinated Debt issued by the Borrower after December 1, 2015 as of the end of any fiscal quarter of the Borrower measured quarterly beginning at the end of the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2015.\u201d In addition, Opus waived any Default or Event of Default arising under the Credit Agreement due to our the failure to comply with the requirements of Section 7.11(a) of the Credit Agreement (Tangible Net Worth) for the quarter ended September 30, 2015.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with the financial covenants in the Credit Agreement.\nOn September 16, 2014, we sold 2,300,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering at $15.00 per share and also granted the underwriter a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 300,000 shares of common stock to cover overallotments, if any. We received net proceeds of approximately $31.6 million after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable. See Note 4 Stockholders' Equity, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information.\nWe have historically incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from operating activities, and we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2015, we have a total accumulated deficit of $377.8 million. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we sustained a consolidated net loss of $39.2 million. We expect to use a significant amount of cash in our operations over the next twelve months for our operating activities and servicing of financial liabilities, including increased investment in marketing and sales capabilities to drive revenue growth, and continued investment in our cloud-based services, physical access control solutions, smart card reader products and RFID and NFC products.\nWe believe our raising of funds through public and private offerings of equity securities and the increase in our line of credit with Opus provides sufficient working capital to fund operations for the next 12 months. Over the longer term, we believe our existing cash balance, together with available credit under our Amended Credit Agreement with Opus and our ability to raise capital through public and private offerings will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs to fund operations. However, there can be no assurance that additional capital, if required, will be available to us or that such capital will be available to us on acceptable terms.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have not entered into off-balance sheet arrangements, or issued guarantees to third parties.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following summarizes expected cash requirements for contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than 1\nYear\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More\nthan 5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,737\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual payment obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,160\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,742\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financial liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,669\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,785\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase commitments and other obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 38,684\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,943\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,860\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,399\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur contractual payment obligation was assumed upon our acquisition of Hirsch. See Note 7, Contractual Payment Obligation, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nFinancial liabilities in the above contractual obligations table include payments to be made for principal and interest in accordance with the terms at December 31, 2015 of the Credit Agreement we entered into with Opus as amended on November 10, 2014 and December 4, 2015. See Note 9, Financial Liabilities, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nWe lease facilities, certain equipment, and automobiles under non-cancelable operating lease agreements. Purchases for inventories are highly dependent upon forecasts of customer demand. Due to the uncertainty in demand from our customers, we may have to change, reschedule, or cancel purchases or purchase orders from our suppliers. These changes may lead to vendor cancellation charges on these orders or contractual commitments. See Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nOur other long-term liabilities include gross unrecognized tax benefits, and related interest and penalties. At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years in connection with these tax liabilities. Accordingly, such amounts are not included in the contractual obligation table above.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors which we believe are reasonable based upon the information available to us at the time these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes the following critical accounting policies contain our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:\nTable 91: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Revenue Recognition;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 92: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Inventory Valuation;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Income Taxes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Goodwill;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Intangible and Long-lived Assets; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Stock-based Compensation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met:\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists. We generally rely upon sales contracts or agreements, and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an arrangement.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Delivery has occurred.

We assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Collectability is reasonably assured. We assess collectability based on creditworthiness of customers as determined by credit checks and customer payment histories. We record accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts, estimated customer returns, and pricing credits.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition - Multiple Element Arrangements, and, in certain transactions, ASC 985 Software - Revenue Recognition.\nIn multiple-element arrangements, some sales arrangement are accounted for under the software provisions of ASC 985-605 and others under the provisions that relate to the sale of non-software products.\nIn multiple-element arrangements that include a hardware, bundled with professional services, maintenance contracts, and in some cases with its software products, we evaluate each element, delivered and undelivered, in an arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting. In these multiple element arrangements, revenue is allocated among all elements, delivered and undelivered, based on a vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE\u201d), if available, third-party evidence ( TPE\u201d) if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price ( ESP\u201d) if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. VSOE of selling price is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately. TPE of selling price is established by evaluating largely interchangeable competitor products or services in stand-alone sales to similarly situated customers. The best estimate of selling price is established considering multiple factors, including pricing practices in different geographies and through different sales channels, gross margin objectives, internal costs, competitor pricing strategies and industry technology lifecycles. Some of our offerings contain a significant element of proprietary technology and provide substantially unique features and functionality; as a result, the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality typically cannot be obtained. Additionally, as we are unable to reliably determine what competitors products' selling prices are on a stand-alone basis, typically we are not able to determine TPE for such products. Therefore ESP is used for such products in the selling price hierarchy for allocating the total arrangement consideration.\nIn multiple-element arrangements that include software, we account for each element under the standards of ASC 985-605 related to software. When software is a delivered element, we use the residual method (ASC 605-25) for determining the amount of revenue to recognize for the delivered software component if VSOE for all of the undelivered elements has been established. In sales arrangements where VSOE of fair value has not been established, revenue for all elements is deferred and amortized over the life of the arrangement.\nRevenue from professional services contracts is recognized upon completion of services and customer acceptance, if applicable. Professional services include security system integration, system migration and database conversion services. Revenue from maintenance contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the period of the maintenance contracts. Certain sales arrangement contains hardware, software and professional service elements where professional services are essential to the functionality of the hardware and software system and a test of the functionality of the complete system is required before the customer accepts the system. As a result, hardware, software and professional service elements are accounted for as one unit of accounting and revenue from these arrangements is recognized upon completion of the project.\nInventory Valuation\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost (using FIFO, average cost or standard cost, as applicable) or market (net realizable value). We typically plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand, which can be highly unpredictable and can fluctuate significantly. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record an estimated provision for excess inventory reserve based on judgment and assumptions involving an evaluation of technical obsolescence and our ability to sell based primarily on historical sales patterns and expectations for future demand. Actual demand and market conditions may differ from the projections utilized by management in establishing our inventory reserves. If we were to use different assumptions or utilize different estimates, the amount and timing of our inventory reserves could be materially different. Adverse changes in our inventory reserve valuations could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position.\nIncome Taxes\nOur income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's assessment of estimated current and future income taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, which are expected to result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, for all material jurisdictions, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax balances, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies and results of recent operations. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. The assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating results.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we have federal and state income tax net operating loss ( NOL\u201d) carryforwards of 89.7 million and $17.6 million, respectively, which will expire at various dates starting in 2015. Such NOL carryforwards expire as follows (in thousands):\nTable 101: <table> <tr> <td> Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2016 - 2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2022 - 2027\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58,987\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2028 - 2033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,915\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2034 - 2037\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,267\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 107,315\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit from these NOL carryforwards will not be realized. Accordingly, we have provided a full valuation allowance on any potential deferred tax assets relating to these state NOL carryforwards. If our assumptions change and we determine we will be able to realize these NOLs, the tax benefits relating to any reversal of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2015, will be accounted for as a reduction of income tax expense.\nThe calculation of our tax liabilities involves evaluating uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. ASC 740 states that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, on the basis of the technical merits.\nWe (1) record unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities in accordance with ASC 740 and (2) adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a tax payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is made available.\nWe believe that none of the unrecognized tax benefits, excluding the associated interest and penalties, which are insignificant, may be recognized by the end of 2015.\nWe consider the earnings of all our non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the United States on the basis of estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs and our specific plans for reinvestment of those subsidiary earnings. Should we decide to repatriate foreign earnings, we would need to adjust our income tax provision in the period we determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside the United States.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not subject to amortization but is subject to an annual assessment, at a minimum, for impairment in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other ( ASC 350\u201d). Impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level, which is one level below its operating segment. We evaluate goodwill on an annual basis in the fourth quarter and on an interim basis whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We perform interim goodwill impairment reviews between our annual reviews if certain events and circumstances have occurred, including a deterioration in general economic conditions, an increased competitive environment, a change in management, key personnel, strategy or customers, negative or declining cash flows, or a decline in actual or planned revenue or earnings compared with actual and projected results.\nTo test goodwill for impairment, we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If it is determined it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we test for goodwill impairment using a two-step method as required by ASC 350. The first step of the impairment test compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the\ncarrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, goodwill is considered impaired and a second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. The second step of the impairment test compares the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying value of goodwill and an impairment loss is recognized equal to that difference (i.e., write goodwill down to the implied fair value of goodwill amount).\nFair value of the reporting units is determined using the income, or discounted cash flows approach ( DCF model\u201d) and the reasonableness of such fair value calculations is reviewed using the market approach, which utilizes comparable firms in similar lines of business that are publicly traded or which are part of a public or private transaction. The completion of the DCF model requires that we make a number of significant assumptions to produce an estimate of future cash flows. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, projections of future revenue, gross profit rates, working capital requirements, and discount rates. In determining an appropriate discount rate for each reporting unit we make assumptions about the estimated cost of capital and relevant risks, as appropriate. The projections that we use in our DCF model are updated at least annually and change over time based on historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units. The determination of whether goodwill is impaired involves a significant level of judgment in establishing our assumptions. Changes in our business strategy, government regulations, economic or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments.\nWe believe the methodology that we use to review impairment of goodwill, which includes a significant amount of judgment and estimates, provides us with a reasonable basis to determine whether impairment has occurred. However, many of the factors employed in determining whether our goodwill is impaired are outside of our control and it is reasonably likely that assumptions and estimates will change in future periods. Changes in these factors such as a severe decline in market conditions could result in future impairments to goodwill which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIntangible and Long-lived Assets\nWe evaluate our long-lived assets and certain identifiable amortizable intangible assets for impairment in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment ( ASC 360\u201d) whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets or intangibles may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group. If such asset groups are considered to be impaired (i.e., if the sum of its estimated future undiscounted cash flows used to test for recoverability is less than its carrying value), the impairment loss to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset groups. Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe recognize stock-based compensation expense for all share-based payment awards in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation ( ASC 718\u201d). Stock-based compensation expense for expected-to-vest awards is valued under the single-option approach and amortized on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures. We utilize the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model in order to determine the fair value of stock-based option awards. The Black-Scholes-Merton model requires various highly subjective assumptions including volatility, expected option life, and risk-free interest rate. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent management's best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those expected-to-vest shares. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, our recorded stock-based compensation expense and operating results could be different.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2015-05, Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement\u201d (ASU 2015-05\u201d), which clarifies the circumstances under which a cloud computing customer would account for the arrangement as a license of internal-use software. ASU 2015-05 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-05 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs\u201d ( ASU 2015-03\u201d), which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs on the balance sheet by requiring entities to present such costs as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. ASU 2015-03 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-03 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-01, Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items\u201d ( ASU 2015-01\u201d). Under ASU 2015-01, an entity will no longer be allowed to separately disclose extraordinary items, net of tax, in the income statement after income from continuing operations if an event or transaction is unusual in nature and occurs infrequently. ASU 2015-01 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption, we may elect prospective or retrospective application. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-01 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\u201d, ( ASU 2014-15\u201d), which requires management to perform interim and annual assessments on whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued and to provide related disclosures, if required. The amendments in ASU 2014-15 are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers\" ( ASU 2014-09\u201d), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing U.S. GAAP. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue From Contracts With Customers (Topic 606)\u201d ( ASU 2015-14\u201d), which defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year to annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The new guidance is effective for us beginning January 1, 2018 and will provide us additional time to evaluate the method and impact that ASU 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements.\nTable 102: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThis Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K ( Annual Report\u201d) contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. We assume no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\nEach of the terms the Company,\u201d Identiv,\u201d we\u201d and us\u201d as used herein refers collectively to Identiv, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated.\nOverview\nIdentiv is a global security technology company that secures data, physical places and things. Global organizations in the government, education, retail, transportation, healthcare and other markets rely upon our solutions. We empower them to create safe, secure, validated and convenient experiences in schools, government offices, factories, transportation, hospitals and virtually every type of facility and for every type of product.\nAt the beginning of September 2013, we undertook a strategic review of our business and initiated a series of actions to simplify our business structure and streamline our operations. Following the changes in our organizational structure, we changed our operating segments to focus on the following solutions:\n \u00b7 Premises solutions securing buildings via an integrated access control system. \n \u00b7 Information solutions securing enterprise information including PCs, networks, email encryption, login, and printers via delivery of smart card reader products and identity management via our idOnDemand service. \n \u00b7 Everyday items solutions securing connected items, including electronic toys, medical devices, wearables and other internet of things applications \nThe foundation of our business are our expertise in RFID and access control, our close customer relationships that allow us to develop customer-relevant products, and our core value of quality.\nTo deliver these solutions, the Company has organized its operations into four reportable business segments, principally by product families: Premises, Identity, Credentials and All Other.\nPremises\nThe foundation of our premises business is the Hirsch line of controllers including the advanced MX line, Hirsch's Velocity management software and our ICPAM software, EDGE controller and reader package. Our modular Hirsch MX controllers are designed to be scalable, allowing customers to start with a small system and expand over time. Hirsch MX controllers can operate autonomously, whether as a single controller or as part of a networked system with Velocity software. The Hirsch Velocity software platform enables centralized management of access and security operations across an organization, including control of doors, gates, turnstiles, elevators and other building equipment, monitoring users as they move around a facility, preventing unwanted access, maintaining compliance and providing a robust audit trail.\nuTrust door readers provide unique features to support a number of security environments and standards. For example, uTrust TS readers support the majority of legacy card credentials with a robust next-generation platform that can help companies migrate to more secure credentials and technologies, including smart cards, near field communication ( NFC\u201d) and government-issued credentials. uTrust Scramblepad readers employ numerical scrambling on the keypad to protect access codes from being stolen as they are entered.\nIdentity\nOur Identity products include smart card readers, which includes a broad range of contact, contactless, portable and mobile smart card readers, tokens and terminals that are utilized around the world to enable logical (i.e., PC, network or data) access and security and identification applications, such as national ID, payment, e-Health and e-Government.\nRelated to our reader product line, we are a leading provider in the definition and provisioning of access cards and other devices to allow users to conveniently and securely access their facilities and resources, and to empower facilities and security administrators to deploy exactly the solutions they want to provide the optimal mix of cost, security and convenience to their user community, whether students, hospital patients, military and government personnel, consumers or a vast array of users.\nCredentials\nOur Credentials products include NFC and radio frequency identification ( RFID\u201d) products - including inlays and inlay-based cards - labels, tags and stickers, as well as other radio frequency ( RF\u201d) and IC components. These products are manufactured in our state-of-the-art facility in Singapore and are used in a diverse range of physical applications, including electronic entertainment games, loyalty cards, mobile payment systems, transit and event ticketing, and brand authenticity from pharmaceuticals to consumer goods, hospital resource management and many others.\nLeveraging our expertise in RFID, physical access and physical authentication, we're developing new solutions to extend our platforms across a wide variety of physical use cases. The next major opportunity in our connected world is the Internet of things, which fundamentally is about physical things. We believe our core strength in physical access and physical instrumentation (RFID) markets, our well-established platforms and our deep knowledge of the relevant technologies, position us well in this growth market.\nAll Other\nThe All Other segment includes products, such as Chipdrive and Digital Media readers. The products included in the All Other segment do not meet the quantitative thresholds for determining reportable segments and therefore have been combined for reporting purposes.\nWe primarily conduct sales and marketing activities in each of the markets in which we compete, utilizing our own sales and marketing organization to solicit prospective channel partners and customers, provide technical advice and support with respect to products, systems and services, and manage relationships with customers, distributors and/or original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs\u201d). We utilize indirect sales channels that may include OEMs, dealers, systems integrators, value added resellers, resellers or Internet sales, although we also sell directly to end users. In support of our sales efforts, we participate in industry events and conduct sales training courses, targeted marketing programs, and ongoing customer, channel partner and third-party communications programs.\nOur corporate headquarters are located in Fremont, California. We maintain research and development facilities in California, and Chennai, India, and local operations and sales facilities in Australia, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Singapore and the U.S. We were founded in 1990 in Munich, Germany and incorporated in 1996 under the laws of the State of Delaware.\nFor a discussion of our net revenue by segment and geographic location, see Note 10, Segment Reporting and Geographic Information in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nRecent Developments in our Business\nIn September 2013, we undertook a strategic review of our business and initiated a series of actions to simplify our business structure and streamline our operations.\nThe first of these actions was to realign our organizational structure to operate as a single, unified company rather than as a group of individual businesses. This change in our structure enhances our ability to coordinate and focus our strategic and operational activities. To signal this change, we implemented a new corporate identity using the word mark and logo Identiv\u201d in place of Identive Group.\u201d We also reorganized our management team and our operational activities by function (e.g., engineering, sales, marketing, customer service and information technology), allowing centralized management of key activities on a global basis. With the reorganization of and changes to our management team, we moved our executive headquarters to Fremont, California and relocated our operational and certain administrative activities from Ismaning, Germany to our facility in Santa Ana, California.\nAnother important action was the divestiture of businesses that were determined to be non-core to our ongoing strategy. In December 2013 we completed the sale of our Multicard and payment solution subsidiaries in Europe. In February 2014 we completed\nthe sale of our Multicard subsidiary in the U.S. and in July 2014, we sold certain non-core assets related to one of our U. S. based subsidiaries. We have accounted for these divested businesses as discontinued operations, and the statements of operations for all periods presented reflect the discontinuance of these businesses. For more information, see Note 2 Discontinued Operations in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nStarting in 2014, our operating segments align to our current market strategy. We reported our financial results under these segments beginning with our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2014.\nOur Strategy\nOur corporate priority is to drive revenue growth by leveraging our core expertise from our existing product portfolio, as well as our significant experience addressing customers' security challenges across multiple markets, including the government, transportation, healthcare, education, banking, critical infrastructure and others.\nTrends in our Business\nGeographic net revenue, based on each customer's ship-to location, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 is as follows:\nTable 79: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Americas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 40,848\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 51,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Europe and the Middle East\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asia-Pacific\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,474\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 60,794\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 81,249\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Americas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Europe and the Middle East\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asia-Pacific\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Revenue Trends\nNet revenue in 2015 was $60.8 million, down 25% compared with $81.2 million in 2014. Approximately 45% of our net revenue came from our Credentials segment. Net revenue in our Credentials segment in 2015 was $27.3 million compared to $41.6 million in 2014. Net revenue in our Premises segment in 2015 was $20.0 million compared to $19.0 million in 2014 reflecting a rebound in activity related to U.S. Government entities, which was weak in 2014. The growth in our Premises segment net revenue was more than offset by a 30% decline in net revenue in our Identity segment. The net revenue decline in our Identity segment reflects continued weakness in sales of smart card readers within Europe and the Middle East where sales activity has declined due to continuing economic uncertainty in the region. Premises products accounted for 33% of our business in 2015 and our Identity products accounted for 20% of our net revenue.\nNet revenue in the Americas. Net revenue in the Americas was $40.8 million in 2015, accounting for 67% of total net revenue and down 20% compared with $51.3 million in 2014. Net revenue from physical access control solutions for security programs within various U.S. Government agencies, as well as RFID and NFC products, inlays and tags comprise a significant proportion of our net revenue in the Americas region.\nNet revenue from our Premises segment in the Americas increased by approximately 8% in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to an increase in orders for physical access control solutions from federal and state agency customers. Net revenue from our Identity segment in the Americas remained relatively stable in 2015 compared to 2014. Net revenue from our Credentials segment in the Americas declined 35% in 2015 compared to 2014. The Credential segment net revenue decrease was primarily due to the timing of orders in North America for electronic game toy pieces and other Internet of Things applications.\nAs a general trend, U.S. Federal agencies continue to be subject to security improvement mandates under programs such as Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 and reiterated in memoranda from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB M-11-11). We believe that our physical access control solutions is an attractive offering in the market to help agencies move towards compliance with federal directives and mandates. To expand our sales opportunities in the United States in general and with orders\nsourced from U.S. Government agencies in particular, we have strengthened our U.S. sales organization and reopened a sales presence in Washington D.C.\nNet revenue in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia-Pacific. Net revenue in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia-Pacific was $19.9 million in 2015, accounting for 33% of total net revenue and down 33% from $29.9 million in 2014. Net revenue in these regions are very dependent on the completion of large projects and the timing of orders placed by some of our larger customers. Sales of Identity readers and RFID and NFC products and tags comprise a significant proportion of our net revenue in these regions.\nNet revenue from our Identity products decreased by approximately 40% in 2015 compared to 2014, as 2014 included the completion of a large order to a significant customer in Germany as well as large orders from two significant customers in Asia. In 2015, we did not see a repeat of these major orders as these customers had recently placed significant fourth quarter 2014 orders. Identity readers comprise approximately 38% of the net revenue throughout these regions in 2015. Net revenue from our Credentials products, which comprise approximately 41% of the sales in these regions, declined by approximately 32% in 2015 compared to 2014 as sales in Europe have been negatively impacted by the transfer of local production of NFC inlays and tags to Singapore following the end of the second quarter of 2014. Net revenue from our Premises products decreased by 13% in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily driven by the completion of projects in the Middle East involving our physical access control solutions in 2014.\nSeasonality and Other Factors. In our business overall, we may experience significant variations in demand for our offerings from quarter to quarter, and typically experience a stronger demand cycle in the second half of our fiscal year. Sales of our premises solutions to U.S. Government agencies are subject to annual government budget cycles and generally are highest in the third quarter of each year. However, the usual seasonal trend can be negatively impacted by actions such as government shutdowns and the passing of continuing resolutions which can act to delay the completion of certain projects. Sales of our identity reader chips, many of which are sold to government agencies worldwide, are impacted by testing and compliance schedules of government bodies as well as roll-out schedules for application deployments, both of which contribute to variability in demand from quarter to quarter. Further, this business is typically subject to seasonality based on differing commercial and global government budget cycles. Lower sales are expected in the U.S. in the first half, and in particular the first quarter of the year, with higher sales typically in the second half of each year. In Asia and Australia, with fiscal year-ends in March and June, order demand can be high in the first half as customers attempt to complete projects before the end of the fiscal year. Accordingly, our net revenue levels in the first quarter and first half each year often depends on the relative strength of project completions and sales mix between our U.S. customer base and our International customer base.\nIn addition to the general seasonality of demand, overall U.S. Government expenditure patterns have a significant impact on demand for our products due to the significant portion of revenues that are typically sourced from U.S. Government agencies. Therefore, any significant reduction in U.S. Government spending could adversely impact our financial results and could cause our operating results to fall below any guidance we provide to the market or below the expectations of investors or security analysts.\nOperating Expense Trends\nBase Operating Expenses\nOur base operating expenses (i.e. research and development, selling and marketing, and general and administrative spending) increased 22% in 2015 compared to 2014. Research and development spending increased by 33% in 2015 compared to 2014, mainly due to the transfer of existing employees into research and development and the addition of new employees, leading to higher payroll costs, and travel expenses, as well as higher costs for external services and contractors. Selling and marketing spending in 2015 were down by 2% compared to 2014, due to the stabilization of sales and marketing organization headcount and marketing program spending. General and administrative spending in 2015 increased 54% from 2014 due to a large increase in legal and professional fees and increases in stock-based compensation in 2015.\nSimplification and Streamlining of our Business\nIn September 2013, we undertook a strategic review of our business and initiated a series of actions to simplify our business structure and streamline our operations. As a consequence of our strategic review in late 2013 and early 2014, we disposed of non-core or under-performing businesses, including our Multicard AG, payment solution AG, Multicard Nederland BV and Multicard U.S. subsidiaries. Additionally, we ceased any additional investment in the Tagtrail mobile services platform. To further simplify our business and streamline our operations, we restructured our organization to operate as a single, unified company rather than as a group of individual businesses. This restructuring included the realignment of our management team and our operational activities by function (for example engineering, sales, marketing, customer service and information technology). With the centralization of various functions, we also eliminated several redundant positions. Additionally, we completed the process of transferring various functions, such as corporate financial accounting and reporting from Germany to the U.S., in the third quarter of 2014.\nTo streamline production and operations in our Credentials business, we initiated the closure of our German production facility for RFID and NFC inlays, tags, and labels to consolidate production in our facility in Singapore. The closure of this production facility was completed in the second quarter of 2014. We have in the past expanded production capacity with the addition of production and assembly lines at our existing facility in California and via partnerships with external manufacturers, and we are planning to further invest in our card production capabilities. Additionally, we continue to invest in enhancements to our data center infrastructure to support the expected growth of our cloud service offerings.\nIn addition to the initiatives noted above, on January 27, 2016, we commenced the implementation of a worldwide restructuring plan designed to refocus resources on our core business segments, including physical access and transponders, and to further consolidate our operations in several worldwide locations. The restructuring plan includes a reduction of approximately 25% of our non-manufacturing employee base, reallocating overhead roles into direct business activities and the elimination of certain management and executive roles. See Note 11, Restructuring and Severance, and Note 15, Subsequent Events, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information.\nRestructuring and Severance\nAs a result of the actions discussed above, certain employees related to non-core functions were terminated. In the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded $3.1 million in restructuring, severance and other closure related costs. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded $1.3 million in severance costs primarily related to restructuring within our sales and marketing organization in conjunction with recent corporate restructuring and cost reduction activities.\nIn connection with the January 2016 restructuring initiatives, we estimate that we will incur aggregate cash charges of approximately $1.6 million to $2.0 million, consisting of approximately $1.5 million to $1.75 million related to severance payments to employees and approximately $100,000 to $250,000 in lease termination fees. The majority of the charges are expected to be paid out during the first quarter of 2016.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table includes segment net revenue and segment net profit information by business segment and reconciles gross profit to results of continuing operations before income taxes and noncontrolling interest. The results for 2015 and 2014 have been adjusted for divested businesses as discussed in Note 2 Discontinued Operations, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nTable 80:

Compared with Fiscal 2014\nNet Revenue\nNet revenue in 2015 was $60.8 million, down 25% compared with $81.2 million in 2014. Net revenue was lower in 2015 primarily reflecting lower sales in our Identity, Credentials and All Other segments, partially offset by higher sales in our Premises segment. A more detailed discussion of revenues by segment follows below.\nOur products are sold to end customers in the government, enterprise and commercial markets to address vertical market segments including public services administration, military and defense, law enforcement, healthcare, education, banking, industrial, retail and critical infrastructure.\nIn our Premises segment, we provide solutions and services that enable the issuance, management and use of secure identity credentials in diverse markets. Our Premises segment includes products to secure buildings via an integrated access control system, and includes MX controllers, Velocity management software and TS door readers. Our modular Hirsch MX controllers are designed to be scalable, allowing customers to start with a small system and expand over time. Hirsch MX controllers can operate autonomously, whether as a single controller or as part of a networked system with Velocity software. The Hirsch Velocity software platform enables centralized management of access and security operations across an organization, including control of doors, gates, turnstiles, elevators and other building equipment, monitoring users as they move around a facility, preventing unwanted access, maintaining compliance and providing a robust audit trail. uTrust door readers provide unique features to support a number of security environments and standards. For example, uTrust Scramblepad readers employ numerical scrambling on the keypad to protect access codes from being stolen as they are entered. uTrust TS readers support the majority of legacy card credentials with a robust next-generation platform that can help companies migrate to more secure credentials and technologies, including smart cards, NFC and government-issued credentials. Because of the complex nature of the problems we address for our Premises solutions customers, pricing pressure is not prevalent in this segment.\nNet revenue in our Premises segment was $20.0 million in 2015, an increase of 5% from $19.0 million in 2014. The increase in 2015 primarily was due to higher sales of physical access control solutions in the U.S., resulting from higher overall demand from U.S. Government customers compared to 2014.\nIn our Identity segment, we offer products to secure enterprise information, including PCs, networks, email encryption, login, and printers via delivery of smart card reader products and identity management via our idOnDemand service. Identiv offers smart card readers - a broad range of contact, contactless and mobile smart card readers, tokens and terminals - to enable logical (i.e., PC, network or data) access and security and identification applications, such as national ID, payment, e-Health and e-Government. Our idOnDemand service can be used to provision (i.e., create and issue) and manage identity credentials.\nNet revenue in our Identity segment was $12.0 million in 2015, a decrease of 30% from $17.0 million in 2014. This decrease in Identity segment net revenue in 2015 was primarily the result of significant orders being received in 2014 from our German and Asian customers which were not repeated in 2015, and also reflects continuing economic uncertainty in the international markets we do business in as well as the negative impact of a strong U.S. dollar in 2015 compared to 2014.\nIn our Credentials segment, we offer access cards and RFID and NFC products, including cards, inlays, labels, tags and stickers, as well as other RF components. These products are manufactured in our state-of-the-art facility in Singapore and are used in a diverse range of identity-based applications, including electronic entertainment, loyalty schemes, mobile payment, transit and event ticketing. In our RFID and NFC product business, there is a trend towards a higher overall average selling price as we sell a higher proportion of finished tickets and tags in addition to our inlays. The margins for access cards have been relatively stable.\nNet revenue in our Credentials segment was $27.3 million in 2015, down 34% from $41.6 million in 2014. The Credential net revenue decrease in 2015 was primarily due to the timing of the receipt of orders in North America and Europe for electronic game toy pieces and other Internet of Things applications.\nThe All Other segment includes sales of our Chipdrive brand and Digital Media reader products.\nNet revenue in our All Other segment was $1.5 million in 2015, down 57% from $3.6 million in 2014. Digital Media reader product sales were down significantly in 2015 compared to 2014 and are expected to remain at low levels as certain customers are expected to exit this business.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for 2015 was $23.1 million, or 38% of revenues, compared to $33.5 million or 41% of revenues in 2014. Gross profit represents revenues less direct cost of product sales, manufacturing overhead, other costs directly related to preparing the product for sale including freight, scrap, inventory adjustments and amortization, where applicable. Gross profit margins were down in 2015 primarily related to product mix with significantly higher sales in our lower-margin segments and inventory write downs and reserve adjustments.\nIn our Premises segment, gross profit on sales of physical access control solutions, including panels, controllers, and access readers was $11.5 million in 2015 and $11.4 million in 2014. Gross profit was higher in 2015 as a direct result of higher sales in the Premises segment in 2014. Gross profit margins in the Premises segment were relatively stable ranging from 58% in 2015 to 60% in 2014.\nIn our Identity segment, gross profit on sales of information readers and modules as well as cloud-based credential provisioning and management services was $5.0 million in 2015 compared to $8.2 million in 2014. Gross profit was lower in 2015 as a direct result of lower sales in the Identity segment in 2014. Gross profit margins in the Identity segment were lower in 2015 at 42% compared to 48% in 2014 due to product mix and the negative impact of absorbing fixed overhead over a smaller revenue base in the period.\nIn our Credentials segment, gross profit on sales of RFID & NFC inlays and tags was $5.6 million in 2015 and $11.9 million in 2014. Gross profit was lower in 2015 as a direct result of higher sales of transponders in the Credentials segment in 2014. Gross profit margins in the Credentials segment decreased from 29% in 2014 to 21% in 2015.\nWe expect there will be some variation in our gross profit from period to period, as our gross profit has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including, without limitation, competition, product pricing, the volume of sales in any given quarter, manufacturing volumes, product configuration and mix, the availability of new products, product enhancements, software and services, risk of inventory write-downs and the cost and availability of components.\nOperating Expenses\nInformation about our operating expenses for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 is set forth below.\nResearch and Development\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,249\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of employee compensation and fees for the development of hardware, software and firmware products. We focus the bulk of our research and development activities on the continued development of existing products and the development of new offerings for emerging market opportunities.\nResearch and development expenses were higher in 2015 primarily due to the transfer of existing employees into research and development and the addition of new employees, leading to higher payroll costs and travel expenses, as well as higher costs for external services and contractors in 2015.\nSelling and Marketing\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling and marketing expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,635\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (399\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.9\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee compensation as well as amortization expense of certain intangible assets, tradeshow participation, advertising and other marketing and selling costs.\nThe level of selling and marketing expenses represents the stabilization of sales and marketing organization headcount and marketing program spending resulting from actions begun in 2013 to simplify our business structure and streamline our operations.\nGeneral and Administrative\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 53.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation expenses for employees performing administrative functions, and professional fees incurred for legal, auditing and other consulting services.\nGeneral and administrative spending in 2015 increased from 2014 due to a large increase in legal and professional fees and increases in stock-based compensation.\nEarn-out and Impairment Charges\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Earn-out consideration\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,510\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,510\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment of goodwill\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement entered into on April 29, 2011 between the selling stockholders of idOnDemand, Inc. (the idOnDemand Agreement\u201d) and us, we accrued an earn-out obligation for the year ended December 31, 2014. The estimated earn-out consideration was calculated based on the achievement of specific financial and sales performance targets as defined in the idOnDemand Agreement. The earn-out consideration liability was settled during the quarter ended June 30, 2015 by the issuance of common stock to the selling shareholders.\nAs detailed in Note 6, Goodwill and Intangible Assets in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements, under our accounting policy, we are required to perform an annual impairment review of our goodwill and an interim analysis of our long-lived assets, when there are changes in our business that may indicate impairment of those assets.\nDuring the second quarter of 2015, we noted certain indicators of impairment, including a sustained decline in the price of our common stock and continued reduced performance in our Identity reporting unit. Based on the results of step one of the goodwill impairment analysis, we determined that the net adjusted carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value of the Identity reporting unit. As a result, we concluded that the carrying value of goodwill for our Identity reporting unit was fully impaired and recorded an impairment charge of approximately $1.0 million in our consolidated statements of operations during the second quarter of 2015.\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2015, our stock price declined significantly which resulted in a significant reduction in our fair value and market capitalization. The stock price declined from $3.64 as of October 1, 2015 to $1.99 as of December 31, 2015, and subsequently dropped further, reaching a low of $1.56 in February 2016. Additionally, our net losses continued in the quarter ended December 31, 2015, and we announced a worldwide restructuring plan designed to refocus resources on our core business segments and to consolidate operations in several worldwide locations. As a result, we performed an impairment test and determined that our goodwill was fully impaired based on qualitative factors as the net fair value of the company exceeded its carrying value. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $7.8 million in our consolidated statement of operations in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nIn December 2014, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and found no potential indicators of impairment. In addition, our assessments of long-lived assets during 2015 and 2014 found no indicators of impairment during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nRestructuring and Severance Charges\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restructuring and severance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,832\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (59.1\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2014, certain employees related to non-core functions were terminated, the process of transferring corporate financial accounting and reporting from Germany to the U.S. commenced and certain manufacturing facilities were scheduled to close with activities consolidated within existing facilities. As a result, we recorded restructuring and severance charges of $3.1 million primarily related to restructuring, severance and other closure related costs in 2014. During 2015, we recorded an additional $1.3 million in severance costs, as part of management's continuing efforts to simplify business operations.\nSee Note 11, Restructuring and Severance in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information.\nNon-operating Income (Expense)\nInformation about our non-operating income (expense) for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 is set forth below.\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,908\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,619\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (47.3\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Foreign currency (loss) gain, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,211\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,270\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.6\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net consists of interest on financial liabilities and interest accretion expense for a liability to a former related party arising from our acquisition of Hirsch Electronics Corporation ( Hirsch\u201d), offset by interest earned on invested cash. The higher net interest expense in 2014 is due to our entry into a bank term loan and revolving loan facility on March 31, 2014 with Opus Bank ( Opus\u201d) and repayment of all outstanding amounts under the secured debt facility with Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc. ( Hercules\u201d). In connection with the repayment of our secured debt facility with Hercules, we recorded a $1.6 million charge to interest expense in 2014 in our consolidated statement of operations. The $1.6 million charge to interest expense included $0.9 million related to write-off of deferred costs, $0.6 million related to write-off of discounts on the secured note and $0.1 million related to prepayment fees as stipulated in the Hercules agreement and forfeiture of a facility charge paid at the inception of the agreement.\nSee Note 7, Long-Term Payment Obligation and Note 8, Financial Liabilities in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information on our interest expense and financial obligations.\nForeign Currency (Losses) Gains, Net\nWe recorded net foreign currency losses of $1.2 million and $1.3 million in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Changes in currency valuation in the periods mainly were the result of exchange rate movements between the U.S. dollar and the euro and the Swiss franc and their impact on the valuation of intercompany transaction balances. Accordingly, they are predominantly non-cash items. Our foreign currency gains and losses primarily result from the valuation of current assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the respective entity in the local financial statements.\nIncome Taxes\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax provision\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (222\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (95\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (127\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 133.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amount of income (loss) we earn in jurisdictions, which we expect to be fairly consistent in the near term. It is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year, but are not consistent from year to year. The following items had the most significant impact on the difference between our statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of 34% and our effective tax rate in fiscal years 2015 and 2014.\n2015 - A reduction of $11.7 million, or 30.1% to the statutory rate resulted from changes in valuation allowance during the year. A reduction of $2.6 million, or 6.8% resulted from the impairment of goodwill, and an addition of $1.3 million, or 3.5% resulted from rate differences between U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions. No U.S. taxes were provided with respect to undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as these earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. Significant jurisdictions causing this difference are Germany and Singapore. The net effect of all changes was an income tax expense of $0.1 million recorded in 2015.\n2014 - A reduction of $3.9 million, or 27.0% to the statutory rate resulted from changes in valuation allowance during the year, A reduction of $1.1 million, or 6.8% resulted from the settlement of the earn-out consideration liability, and a reduction of $0.9 million, or 5.5%, resulted from rate differences between U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions. No U.S. taxes were provided with respect to undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as these earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. Significant jurisdictions causing this difference are Germany and Singapore. The net effect of all changes was an income tax expense of $0.1 million recorded in 2014.\nDiscontinued Operations\nIn November 2013, we committed to a plan to sell our Multicard US business and completed the sale of this business on February 4, 2014. Additionally, we entered into an asset purchase agreement to sell certain non-core assets related to one of our subsidiaries to a former employee in June 2014 and completed the sale of these non-core assets in July 2014. All of these businesses (collectively, our divested businesses\u201d) have been accounted for as discontinued operations in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nNo net revenue was recorded for the divested businesses in 2015 and $1.3 million was recorded in 2014. No income from discontinued operations before income taxes was recorded in 2015 and $0.5 million was recorded in 2014.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2015, our working capital, defined as current assets less current liabilities, was $25.1 million, a decrease of $16.9 million compared to $42.0 million as of December 31, 2014. The decrease in working capital reflects a net loss of $39.2 million and changes in operating assets and liabilities negatively impacting our liquidity of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, partially offset by non-cash adjustments of $17.5 million. As of December 31, 2015, our cash balance was $16.7 million.\nThe following summarizes our cash flows for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (23,003\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (11,733\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (341\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,131\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41,909\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of exchange rates on cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net decrease in cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (19,880\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash, beginning of year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Add: Cash of discontinued operations, at beginning of year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: Cash of discontinued operations, end of year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash, end of year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSignificant commitments that will require the use of cash in future periods include obligations under operating leases, our contractual payment obligation assumed upon our acquisition of Hirsch, secured note and revolver, purchase commitments and other obligations. Gross committed operating lease obligations are $4.1 million, our contractual payment obligation assumed upon our acquisition of Hirsch is $6.7 million, the bank term loan, revolving loan facility and interest related obligation is $19.7 million, and purchase commitments and other obligations are $8.2 million at December 31, 2015. Total commitments due within one year are $9.0 million and due thereafter are $29.7 million at December 31, 2015. These commitment levels are based on existing terms of our operating leases, obligations with suppliers, our contractual payment obligation and the existing credit agreement with Opus as of December 31, 2015.\nCash used in operating activities for 2015 primarily was due to the net loss of $39.2 million and decreases in cash from net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $1.3 million which was partially offset by adjustments for certain non-cash items of $17.5 million which primarily consisted of impairment of goodwill, depreciation, amortization, amortization of debt issue costs and stock-based compensation. For 2014, cash used in operating activities primarily was due to the net loss of $17.9 million and a decrease in cash from net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $4.9 million, which were partially offset be adjustments for certain non-cash items of $11.1 million.\nCash used in investing activities for 2015 reflects $0.3 million in capital expenditures. For 2014, cash provided by investing activities reflects $1.4 million in proceeds on sale of discontinued operations, offset by $1.3 million in capital expenditures.\nCash provided by financing activities reflects an additional $4.0 million in proceeds from debt borrowings less cash used to repurchase common stock of $1.9 million. For the year ended December 31, 2014, cash provided by financing activities primarily reflects $14.3 million net cash proceeds from borrowings of debt, less repayments to Opus and $35.8 million net cash proceeds from sales of common stock, partially offset by cash payments of $6.7 million for financial liabilities related to a debt facility repaid in full on March 31, 2014 and $1.7 million for the repurchase of common stock during the year.\nWe consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, if any, as of December 31, 2015, to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no U.S. income taxes have been provided thereon. Generally most of our foreign subsidiaries have accumulated deficits and cash and cash equivalents that are held outside the United States are typically not cash generated from earnings that would be subject to tax upon repatriation if transferred to the United States. We have access to the cash held outside the United States to fund domestic operations and obligations without any material income tax consequences. As of December 31, 2015, the amount of cash included at such subsidiaries was $2.2 million. We have not, nor do we anticipate the need to, repatriate funds to the United States to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business, including liquidity needs associated with our domestic debt service requirements.\nOn October 30, 2012, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the Loan Agreement\u201d) with Hercules. The Loan Agreement provided for a term loan in aggregate principal amount of up to $10.0 million with an initial drawdown of $7.5 million. The initial drawdown of $7.5 million was secured by a secured term promissory note dated October 30, 2012. As discussed below, we repaid all outstanding amounts under the Loan Agreement in connection with the closing of the Credit Agreement with Opus on\nMarch 31, 2014. See Note 8 Financial Liabilities in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information.\nOn April 16, 2013, we entered into a purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement\u201d) with LPC, pursuant to which we have the right to sell to LPC up to $20 million in shares of our common stock, subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement. We directed LPC to purchase 496,500 shares of common stock from January 1, 2014 through September 30, 2014 for net consideration of $4.2 million. See Note 4 Stockholders' Equity, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information.\nOn March 31, 2014, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) with Opus. The Credit Agreement provides for a term loan in the aggregate principal amount of $10.0 million ( Term Loan\u201d) which was drawn down on March 31, 2014, and an additional $10.0 million revolving loan facility ( Revolving Loan Facility\u201d), of which $4.0 million was drawn down on March 31, 2014 and an additional $2.0 million was drawn down during the three months ended June 30, 2014. In connection with the closing of the Credit Agreement, we repaid all outstanding amounts under the Loan Agreement with Hercules. The proceeds of the Term Loan and the initial loans under the Revolving Loan Facility, after payment of fees to Opus and expenses and all outstanding amounts under the Loan Agreement, were approximately $7.8 million. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all assets of the Company. On November 10, 2014 and on December 4, 2015, we amended the Credit Agreement with Opus (the Amended Credit Agreement\u201d) which changes a number of terms of the Credit Agreement including interest charged, the monthly installment payment schedule, the maximum amount available under the revolving loan facility and the maturity date as well as certain other terms and conditions. See Note 8 Financial Liabilities, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information.\nOn December 4, 2015, we entered into an amendment (the Credit Amendment\u201d) to our Credit Agreement with Opus. The Credit Amendment amended and restated Section 7.11(a) Financial Covenants to read as follows: Tangible Net Worth. Permit the sum of the Consolidated Tangible Net Worth plus the amount shown on the Borrower's current balance sheet for the 1994 Settlement Agreement to be less than the sum of $8,000,000 plus, an amount equal to 50% of the amount of any Cash proceeds from any equity or Subordinated Debt issued by the Borrower after December 1, 2015 as of the end of any fiscal quarter of the Borrower measured quarterly beginning at the end of the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2015.\u201d In addition, Opus waived any Default or Event of Default arising under the Credit Agreement due to our the failure to comply with the requirements of Section 7.11(a) of the Credit Agreement (Tangible Net Worth) for the quarter ended September 30, 2015.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with the financial covenants in the Credit Agreement.\nOn September 16, 2014, we sold 2,300,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering at $15.00 per share and also granted the underwriter a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 300,000 shares of common stock to cover overallotments, if any. We received net proceeds of approximately $31.6 million after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable. See Note 4 Stockholders' Equity, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information.\nWe have historically incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from operating activities, and we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2015, we have a total accumulated deficit of $377.8 million. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we sustained a consolidated net loss of $39.2 million. We expect to use a significant amount of cash in our operations over the next twelve months for our operating activities and servicing of financial liabilities, including increased investment in marketing and sales capabilities to drive revenue growth, and continued investment in our cloud-based services, physical access control solutions, smart card reader products and RFID and NFC products.\nWe believe our raising of funds through public and private offerings of equity securities and the increase in our line of credit with Opus provides sufficient working capital to fund operations for the next 12 months. Over the longer term, we believe our existing cash balance, together with available credit under our Amended Credit Agreement with Opus and our ability to raise capital through public and private offerings will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs to fund operations. However, there can be no assurance that additional capital, if required, will be available to us or that such capital will be available to us on acceptable terms.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have not entered into off-balance sheet arrangements, or issued guarantees to third parties.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following summarizes expected cash requirements for contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than 1\nYear\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More\nthan 5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,737\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual payment obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,160\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,742\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financial liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,669\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,785\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase commitments and other obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 38,684\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,943\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,860\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,399\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur contractual payment obligation was assumed upon our acquisition of Hirsch. See Note 7, Contractual Payment Obligation, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nFinancial liabilities in the above contractual obligations table include payments to be made for principal and interest in accordance with the terms at December 31, 2015 of the Credit Agreement we entered into with Opus as amended on November 10, 2014 and December 4, 2015. See Note 9, Financial Liabilities, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nWe lease facilities, certain equipment, and automobiles under non-cancelable operating lease agreements. Purchases for inventories are highly dependent upon forecasts of customer demand. Due to the uncertainty in demand from our customers, we may have to change, reschedule, or cancel purchases or purchase orders from our suppliers. These changes may lead to vendor cancellation charges on these orders or contractual commitments. See Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nOur other long-term liabilities include gross unrecognized tax benefits, and related interest and penalties. At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years in connection with these tax liabilities. Accordingly, such amounts are not included in the contractual obligation table above.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors which we believe are reasonable based upon the information available to us at the time these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes the following critical accounting policies contain our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:\n \u00b7 Revenue Recognition; \n \u00b7 Inventory Valuation; \n \u00b7 Income Taxes; \n \u00b7 Goodwill; \n \u00b7 Intangible and Long-lived Assets; and \n \u00b7 Stock-based Compensation. \nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met:\n \u00b7 Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists. We generally rely upon sales contracts or agreements, and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an arrangement. \n \u00b7 Delivery has occurred. We use shipping terms and related documents, or written evidence of customer acceptance, when applicable, to verify delivery or performance. \n \u00b7 Sales price is fixed or determinable. We assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. \n \u00b7 Collectability is reasonably assured. We assess collectability based on creditworthiness of customers as determined by credit checks and customer payment histories. We record accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts, estimated customer returns, and pricing credits. \nWe recognize revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition - Multiple Element Arrangements, and, in certain transactions, ASC 985 Software - Revenue Recognition.\nIn multiple-element arrangements, some sales arrangement are accounted for under the software provisions of ASC 985-605 and others under the provisions that relate to the sale of non-software products.\nIn multiple-element arrangements that include a hardware, bundled with professional services, maintenance contracts, and in some cases with its software products, we evaluate each element, delivered and undelivered, in an arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting. In these multiple element arrangements, revenue is allocated among all elements, delivered and undelivered, based on a vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE\u201d), if available, third-party evidence ( TPE\u201d) if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price ( ESP\u201d) if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. VSOE of selling price is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately. TPE of selling price is established by evaluating largely interchangeable competitor products or services in stand-alone sales to similarly situated customers. The best estimate of selling price is established considering multiple factors, including pricing practices in different geographies and through different sales channels, gross margin objectives, internal costs, competitor pricing strategies and industry technology lifecycles. Some of our offerings contain a significant element of proprietary technology and provide substantially unique features and functionality; as a result, the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality typically cannot be obtained. Additionally, as we are unable to reliably determine what competitors products' selling prices are on a stand-alone basis, typically we are not able to determine TPE for such products. Therefore ESP is used for such products in the selling price hierarchy for allocating the total arrangement consideration.\nIn multiple-element arrangements that include software, we account for each element under the standards of ASC 985-605 related to software. When software is a delivered element, we use the residual method (ASC 605-25) for determining the amount of revenue to recognize for the delivered software component if VSOE for all of the undelivered elements has been established. In sales arrangements where VSOE of fair value has not been established, revenue for all elements is deferred and amortized over the life of the arrangement.\nRevenue from professional services contracts is recognized upon completion of services and customer acceptance, if applicable. Professional services include security system integration, system migration and database conversion services. Revenue from maintenance contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the period of the maintenance contracts. Certain sales arrangement contains hardware, software and professional service elements where professional services are essential to the functionality of the hardware and software system and a test of the functionality of the complete system is required before the customer accepts the system. As a result, hardware, software and professional service elements are accounted for as one unit of accounting and revenue from these arrangements is recognized upon completion of the project.\nInventory Valuation\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost (using FIFO, average cost or standard cost, as applicable) or market (net realizable value). We typically plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand, which can be highly unpredictable and can fluctuate significantly. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record an estimated provision for excess inventory reserve based on judgment and assumptions involving an evaluation of technical obsolescence and our ability to sell based primarily on historical sales patterns and expectations for future demand. Actual demand and market conditions may differ from the projections utilized by management in establishing our inventory reserves. If we were to use different assumptions or utilize different estimates, the amount and timing of our inventory reserves could be materially different. Adverse changes in our inventory reserve valuations could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position.\nIncome Taxes\nOur income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's assessment of estimated current and future income taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, which are expected to result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, for all material jurisdictions, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax balances, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies and results of recent operations. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. The assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating results.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we have federal and state income tax net operating loss ( NOL\u201d) carryforwards of 89.7 million and $17.6 million, respectively, which will expire at various dates starting in 2015. Such NOL carryforwards expire as follows (in thousands):\nTable 101: <table> <tr> <td> Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2016 - 2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2022 - 2027\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58,987\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2028 - 2033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,915\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2034 - 2037\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,267\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 107,315\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit from these NOL carryforwards will not be realized. Accordingly, we have provided a full valuation allowance on any potential deferred tax assets relating to these state NOL carryforwards. If our assumptions change and we determine we will be able to realize these NOLs, the tax benefits relating to any reversal of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2015, will be accounted for as a reduction of income tax expense.\nThe calculation of our tax liabilities involves evaluating uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. ASC 740 states that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, on the basis of the technical merits.\nWe (1) record unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities in accordance with ASC 740 and (2) adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a tax payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is made available.\nWe believe that none of the unrecognized tax benefits, excluding the associated interest and penalties, which are insignificant, may be recognized by the end of 2015.\nWe consider the earnings of all our non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the United States on the basis of estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs and our specific plans for reinvestment of those subsidiary earnings. Should we decide to repatriate foreign earnings, we would need to adjust our income tax provision in the period we determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside the United States.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not subject to amortization but is subject to an annual assessment, at a minimum, for impairment in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other ( ASC 350\u201d). Impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level, which is one level below its operating segment. We evaluate goodwill on an annual basis in the fourth quarter and on an interim basis whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We perform interim goodwill impairment reviews between our annual reviews if certain events and circumstances have occurred, including a deterioration in general economic conditions, an increased competitive environment, a change in management, key personnel, strategy or customers, negative or declining cash flows, or a decline in actual or planned revenue or earnings compared with actual and projected results.\nTo test goodwill for impairment, we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If it is determined it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we test for goodwill impairment using a two-step method as required by ASC 350. The first step of the impairment test compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the\ncarrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, goodwill is considered impaired and a second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. The second step of the impairment test compares the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying value of goodwill and an impairment loss is recognized equal to that difference (i.e., write goodwill down to the implied fair value of goodwill amount).\nFair value of the reporting units is determined using the income, or discounted cash flows approach ( DCF model\u201d) and the reasonableness of such fair value calculations is reviewed using the market approach, which utilizes comparable firms in similar lines of business that are publicly traded or which are part of a public or private transaction. The completion of the DCF model requires that we make a number of significant assumptions to produce an estimate of future cash flows. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, projections of future revenue, gross profit rates, working capital requirements, and discount rates. In determining an appropriate discount rate for each reporting unit we make assumptions about the estimated cost of capital and relevant risks, as appropriate. The projections that we use in our DCF model are updated at least annually and change over time based on historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units. The determination of whether goodwill is impaired involves a significant level of judgment in establishing our assumptions. Changes in our business strategy, government regulations, economic or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments.\nWe believe the methodology that we use to review impairment of goodwill, which includes a significant amount of judgment and estimates, provides us with a reasonable basis to determine whether impairment has occurred. However, many of the factors employed in determining whether our goodwill is impaired are outside of our control and it is reasonably likely that assumptions and estimates will change in future periods. Changes in these factors such as a severe decline in market conditions could result in future impairments to goodwill which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIntangible and Long-lived Assets\nWe evaluate our long-lived assets and certain identifiable amortizable intangible assets for impairment in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment ( ASC 360\u201d) whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets or intangibles may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group. If such asset groups are considered to be impaired (i.e., if the sum of its estimated future undiscounted cash flows used to test for recoverability is less than its carrying value), the impairment loss to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset groups. Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe recognize stock-based compensation expense for all share-based payment awards in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation ( ASC 718\u201d). Stock-based compensation expense for expected-to-vest awards is valued under the single-option approach and amortized on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures. We utilize the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model in order to determine the fair value of stock-based option awards. The Black-Scholes-Merton model requires various highly subjective assumptions including volatility, expected option life, and risk-free interest rate. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent management's best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those expected-to-vest shares. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, our recorded stock-based compensation expense and operating results could be different.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2015-05, Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement\u201d (ASU 2015-05\u201d), which clarifies the circumstances under which a cloud computing customer would account for the arrangement as a license of internal-use software. ASU 2015-05 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-05 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs\u201d ( ASU 2015-03\u201d), which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs on the balance sheet by requiring entities to present such costs as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. ASU 2015-03 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-03 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-01, Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items\u201d ( ASU 2015-01\u201d). Under ASU 2015-01, an entity will no longer be allowed to separately disclose extraordinary items, net of tax, in the income statement after income from continuing operations if an event or transaction is unusual in nature and occurs infrequently. ASU 2015-01 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption, we may elect prospective or retrospective application. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-01 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\u201d, ( ASU 2014-15\u201d), which requires management to perform interim and annual assessments on whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued and to provide related disclosures, if required. The amendments in ASU 2014-15 are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers\" ( ASU 2014-09\u201d), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing U.S. GAAP. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue From Contracts With Customers (Topic 606)\u201d ( ASU 2015-14\u201d), which defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year to annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The new guidance is effective for us beginning January 1, 2018 and will provide us additional time to evaluate the method and impact that ASU 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements.\nTable 102: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThis Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K ( Annual Report\u201d) contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. We assume no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\nEach of the terms the Company,\u201d Identiv,\u201d we\u201d and us\u201d as used herein refers collectively to Identiv, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated.\nOverview\nIdentiv is a global security technology company that secures data, physical places and things. Global organizations in the government, education, retail, transportation, healthcare and other markets rely upon our solutions. We empower them to create safe, secure, validated and convenient experiences in schools, government offices, factories, transportation, hospitals and virtually every type of facility and for every type of product.\nAt the beginning of September 2013, we undertook a strategic review of our business and initiated a series of actions to simplify our business structure and streamline our operations. Following the changes in our organizational structure, we changed our operating segments to focus on the following solutions:\n \u00b7 Premises solutions securing buildings via an integrated access control system. \n \u00b7 Information solutions securing enterprise information including PCs, networks, email encryption, login, and printers via delivery of smart card reader products and identity management via our idOnDemand service. \n \u00b7 Everyday items solutions securing connected items, including electronic toys, medical devices, wearables and other internet of things applications \nThe foundation of our business are our expertise in RFID and access control, our close customer relationships that allow us to develop customer-relevant products, and our core value of quality.\nTo deliver these solutions, the Company has organized its operations into four reportable business segments, principally by product families: Premises, Identity, Credentials and All Other.\nPremises\nThe foundation of our premises business is the Hirsch line of controllers including the advanced MX line, Hirsch's Velocity management software and our ICPAM software, EDGE controller and reader package. Our modular Hirsch MX controllers are designed to be scalable, allowing customers to start with a small system and expand over time. Hirsch MX controllers can operate autonomously, whether as a single controller or as part of a networked system with Velocity software. The Hirsch Velocity software platform enables centralized management of access and security operations across an organization, including control of doors, gates, turnstiles, elevators and other building equipment, monitoring users as they move around a facility, preventing unwanted access, maintaining compliance and providing a robust audit trail.\nuTrust door readers provide unique features to support a number of security environments and standards. For example, uTrust TS readers support the majority of legacy card credentials with a robust next-generation platform that can help companies migrate to more secure credentials and technologies, including smart cards, near field communication ( NFC\u201d) and government-issued credentials. uTrust Scramblepad readers employ numerical scrambling on the keypad to protect access codes from being stolen as they are entered.\nIdentity\nOur Identity products include smart card readers, which includes a broad range of contact, contactless, portable and mobile smart card readers, tokens and terminals that are utilized around the world to enable logical (i.e., PC, network or data) access and security and identification applications, such as national ID, payment, e-Health and e-Government.\nRelated to our reader product line, we are a leading provider in the definition and provisioning of access cards and other devices to allow users to conveniently and securely access their facilities and resources, and to empower facilities and security administrators to deploy exactly the solutions they want to provide the optimal mix of cost, security and convenience to their user community, whether students, hospital patients, military and government personnel, consumers or a vast array of users.\nCredentials\nOur Credentials products include NFC and radio frequency identification ( RFID\u201d) products - including inlays and inlay-based cards - labels, tags and stickers, as well as other radio frequency ( RF\u201d) and IC components. These products are manufactured in our state-of-the-art facility in Singapore and are used in a diverse range of physical applications, including electronic entertainment games, loyalty cards, mobile payment systems, transit and event ticketing, and brand authenticity from pharmaceuticals to consumer goods, hospital resource management and many others.\nLeveraging our expertise in RFID, physical access and physical authentication, we're developing new solutions to extend our platforms across a wide variety of physical use cases. The next major opportunity in our connected world is the Internet of things, which fundamentally is about physical things. We believe our core strength in physical access and physical instrumentation (RFID) markets, our well-established platforms and our deep knowledge of the relevant technologies, position us well in this growth market.\nAll Other\nThe All Other segment includes products, such as Chipdrive and Digital Media readers. The products included in the All Other segment do not meet the quantitative thresholds for determining reportable segments and therefore have been combined for reporting purposes.\nWe primarily conduct sales and marketing activities in each of the markets in which we compete, utilizing our own sales and marketing organization to solicit prospective channel partners and customers, provide technical advice and support with respect to products, systems and services, and manage relationships with customers, distributors and/or original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs\u201d). We utilize indirect sales channels that may include OEMs, dealers, systems integrators, value added resellers, resellers or Internet sales, although we also sell directly to end users. In support of our sales efforts, we participate in industry events and conduct sales training courses, targeted marketing programs, and ongoing customer, channel partner and third-party communications programs.\nOur corporate headquarters are located in Fremont, California. We maintain research and development facilities in California, and Chennai, India, and local operations and sales facilities in Australia, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Singapore and the U.S. We were founded in 1990 in Munich, Germany and incorporated in 1996 under the laws of the State of Delaware.\nFor a discussion of our net revenue by segment and geographic location, see Note 10, Segment Reporting and Geographic Information in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nRecent Developments in our Business\nIn September 2013, we undertook a strategic review of our business and initiated a series of actions to simplify our business structure and streamline our operations.\nThe first of these actions was to realign our organizational structure to operate as a single, unified company rather than as a group of individual businesses. This change in our structure enhances our ability to coordinate and focus our strategic and operational activities. To signal this change, we implemented a new corporate identity using the word mark and logo Identiv\u201d in place of Identive Group.\u201d We also reorganized our management team and our operational activities by function (e.g., engineering, sales, marketing, customer service and information technology), allowing centralized management of key activities on a global basis. With the reorganization of and changes to our management team, we moved our executive headquarters to Fremont, California and relocated our operational and certain administrative activities from Ismaning, Germany to our facility in Santa Ana, California.\nAnother important action was the divestiture of businesses that were determined to be non-core to our ongoing strategy. In December 2013 we completed the sale of our Multicard and payment solution subsidiaries in Europe. In February 2014 we completed\nthe sale of our Multicard subsidiary in the U.S. and in July 2014, we sold certain non-core assets related to one of our U. S. based subsidiaries. We have accounted for these divested businesses as discontinued operations, and the statements of operations for all periods presented reflect the discontinuance of these businesses. For more information, see Note 2 Discontinued Operations in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nStarting in 2014, our operating segments align to our current market strategy. We reported our financial results under these segments beginning with our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2014.\nOur Strategy\nOur corporate priority is to drive revenue growth by leveraging our core expertise from our existing product portfolio, as well as our significant experience addressing customers' security challenges across multiple markets, including the government, transportation, healthcare, education, banking, critical infrastructure and others.\nTrends in our Business\nGeographic net revenue, based on each customer's ship-to location, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 is as follows:\n\nNet Revenue Trends\nNet revenue in 2015 was $60.8 million, down 25% compared with $81.2 million in 2014. Approximately 45% of our net revenue came from our Credentials segment. Net revenue in our Credentials segment in 2015 was $27.3 million compared to $41.6 million in 2014. Net revenue in our Premises segment in 2015 was $20.0 million compared to $19.0 million in 2014 reflecting a rebound in activity related to U.S. Government entities, which was weak in 2014. The growth in our Premises segment net revenue was more than offset by a 30% decline in net revenue in our Identity segment. The net revenue decline in our Identity segment reflects continued weakness in sales of smart card readers within Europe and the Middle East where sales activity has declined due to continuing economic uncertainty in the region. Premises products accounted for 33% of our business in 2015 and our Identity products accounted for 20% of our net revenue.\nNet revenue in the Americas. Net revenue in the Americas was $40.8 million in 2015, accounting for 67% of total net revenue and down 20% compared with $51.3 million in 2014. Net revenue from physical access control solutions for security programs within various U.S. Government agencies, as well as RFID and NFC products, inlays and tags comprise a significant proportion of our net revenue in the Americas region.\nNet revenue from our Premises segment in the Americas increased by approximately 8% in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to an increase in orders for physical access control solutions from federal and state agency customers. Net revenue from our Identity segment in the Americas remained relatively stable in 2015 compared to 2014. Net revenue from our Credentials segment in the Americas declined 35% in 2015 compared to 2014. The Credential segment net revenue decrease was primarily due to the timing of orders in North America for electronic game toy pieces and other Internet of Things applications.\nAs a general trend, U.S. Federal agencies continue to be subject to security improvement mandates under programs such as Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 and reiterated in memoranda from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB M-11-11). We believe that our physical access control solutions is an attractive offering in the market to help agencies move towards compliance with federal directives and mandates. To expand our sales opportunities in the United States in general and with orders\nsourced from U.S. Government agencies in particular, we have strengthened our U.S. sales organization and reopened a sales presence in Washington D.C.\nNet revenue in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia-Pacific. Net revenue in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia-Pacific was $19.9 million in 2015, accounting for 33% of total net revenue and down 33% from $29.9 million in 2014. Net revenue in these regions are very dependent on the completion of large projects and the timing of orders placed by some of our larger customers. Sales of Identity readers and RFID and NFC products and tags comprise a significant proportion of our net revenue in these regions.\nNet revenue from our Identity products decreased by approximately 40% in 2015 compared to 2014, as 2014 included the completion of a large order to a significant customer in Germany as well as large orders from two significant customers in Asia. In 2015, we did not see a repeat of these major orders as these customers had recently placed significant fourth quarter 2014 orders. Identity readers comprise approximately 38% of the net revenue throughout these regions in 2015. Net revenue from our Credentials products, which comprise approximately 41% of the sales in these regions, declined by approximately 32% in 2015 compared to 2014 as sales in Europe have been negatively impacted by the transfer of local production of NFC inlays and tags to Singapore following the end of the second quarter of 2014. Net revenue from our Premises products decreased by 13% in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily driven by the completion of projects in the Middle East involving our physical access control solutions in 2014.\nSeasonality and Other Factors. In our business overall, we may experience significant variations in demand for our offerings from quarter to quarter, and typically experience a stronger demand cycle in the second half of our fiscal year. Sales of our premises solutions to U.S. Government agencies are subject to annual government budget cycles and generally are highest in the third quarter of each year. However, the usual seasonal trend can be negatively impacted by actions such as government shutdowns and the passing of continuing resolutions which can act to delay the completion of certain projects. Sales of our identity reader chips, many of which are sold to government agencies worldwide, are impacted by testing and compliance schedules of government bodies as well as roll-out schedules for application deployments, both of which contribute to variability in demand from quarter to quarter. Further, this business is typically subject to seasonality based on differing commercial and global government budget cycles. Lower sales are expected in the U.S. in the first half, and in particular the first quarter of the year, with higher sales typically in the second half of each year. In Asia and Australia, with fiscal year-ends in March and June, order demand can be high in the first half as customers attempt to complete projects before the end of the fiscal year. Accordingly, our net revenue levels in the first quarter and first half each year often depends on the relative strength of project completions and sales mix between our U.S. customer base and our International customer base.\nIn addition to the general seasonality of demand, overall U.S. Government expenditure patterns have a significant impact on demand for our products due to the significant portion of revenues that are typically sourced from U.S. Government agencies. Therefore, any significant reduction in U.S. Government spending could adversely impact our financial results and could cause our operating results to fall below any guidance we provide to the market or below the expectations of investors or security analysts.\nOperating Expense Trends\nBase Operating Expenses\nOur base operating expenses (i.e. research and development, selling and marketing, and general and administrative spending) increased 22% in 2015 compared to 2014. Research and development spending increased by 33% in 2015 compared to 2014, mainly due to the transfer of existing employees into research and development and the addition of new employees, leading to higher payroll costs, and travel expenses, as well as higher costs for external services and contractors. Selling and marketing spending in 2015 were down by 2% compared to 2014, due to the stabilization of sales and marketing organization headcount and marketing program spending. General and administrative spending in 2015 increased 54% from 2014 due to a large increase in legal and professional fees and increases in stock-based compensation in 2015.\nSimplification and Streamlining of our Business\nIn September 2013, we undertook a strategic review of our business and initiated a series of actions to simplify our business structure and streamline our operations. As a consequence of our strategic review in late 2013 and early 2014, we disposed of non-core or under-performing businesses, including our Multicard AG, payment solution AG, Multicard Nederland BV and Multicard U.S. subsidiaries. Additionally, we ceased any additional investment in the Tagtrail mobile services platform. To further simplify our business and streamline our operations, we restructured our organization to operate as a single, unified company rather than as a group of individual businesses. This restructuring included the realignment of our management team and our operational activities by function (for example engineering, sales, marketing, customer service and information technology). With the centralization of various functions, we also eliminated several redundant positions. Additionally, we completed the process of transferring various functions, such as corporate financial accounting and reporting from Germany to the U.S., in the third quarter of 2014.\nTo streamline production and operations in our Credentials business, we initiated the closure of our German production facility for RFID and NFC inlays, tags, and labels to consolidate production in our facility in Singapore. The closure of this production facility was completed in the second quarter of 2014. We have in the past expanded production capacity with the addition of production and assembly lines at our existing facility in California and via partnerships with external manufacturers, and we are planning to further invest in our card production capabilities. Additionally, we continue to invest in enhancements to our data center infrastructure to support the expected growth of our cloud service offerings.\nIn addition to the initiatives noted above, on January 27, 2016, we commenced the implementation of a worldwide restructuring plan designed to refocus resources on our core business segments, including physical access and transponders, and to further consolidate our operations in several worldwide locations. The restructuring plan includes a reduction of approximately 25% of our non-manufacturing employee base, reallocating overhead roles into direct business activities and the elimination of certain management and executive roles. See Note 11, Restructuring and Severance, and Note 15, Subsequent Events, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information.\nRestructuring and Severance\nAs a result of the actions discussed above, certain employees related to non-core functions were terminated. In the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded $3.1 million in restructuring, severance and other closure related costs. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded $1.3 million in severance costs primarily related to restructuring within our sales and marketing organization in conjunction with recent corporate restructuring and cost reduction activities.\nIn connection with the January 2016 restructuring initiatives, we estimate that we will incur aggregate cash charges of approximately $1.6 million to $2.0 million, consisting of approximately $1.5 million to $1.75 million related to severance payments to employees and approximately $100,000 to $250,000 in lease termination fees. The majority of the charges are expected to be paid out during the first quarter of 2016.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table includes segment net revenue and segment net profit information by business segment and reconciles gross profit to results of continuing operations before income taxes and noncontrolling interest. The results for 2015 and 2014 have been adjusted for divested businesses as discussed in Note 2 Discontinued Operations, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe following table sets forth our statements of operations as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated:\n\nFiscal 2015 Compared with Fiscal 2014\nNet Revenue\nNet revenue in 2015 was $60.8 million, down 25% compared with $81.2 million in 2014. Net revenue was lower in 2015 primarily reflecting lower sales in our Identity, Credentials and All Other segments, partially offset by higher sales in our Premises segment. A more detailed discussion of revenues by segment follows below.\nOur products are sold to end customers in the government, enterprise and commercial markets to address vertical market segments including public services administration, military and defense, law enforcement, healthcare, education, banking, industrial, retail and critical infrastructure.\nIn our Premises segment, we provide solutions and services that enable the issuance, management and use of secure identity credentials in diverse markets. Our Premises segment includes products to secure buildings via an integrated access control system, and includes MX controllers, Velocity management software and TS door readers. Our modular Hirsch MX controllers are designed to be scalable, allowing customers to start with a small system and expand over time. Hirsch MX controllers can operate autonomously, whether as a single controller or as part of a networked system with Velocity software. The Hirsch Velocity software platform enables centralized management of access and security operations across an organization, including control of doors, gates, turnstiles, elevators and other building equipment, monitoring users as they move around a facility, preventing unwanted access, maintaining compliance and providing a robust audit trail. uTrust door readers provide unique features to support a number of security environments and standards. For example, uTrust Scramblepad readers employ numerical scrambling on the keypad to protect access codes from being stolen as they are entered. uTrust TS readers support the majority of legacy card credentials with a robust next-generation platform that can help companies migrate to more secure credentials and technologies, including smart cards, NFC and government-issued credentials. Because of the complex nature of the problems we address for our Premises solutions customers, pricing pressure is not prevalent in this segment.\nNet revenue in our Premises segment was $20.0 million in 2015, an increase of 5% from $19.0 million in 2014. The increase in 2015 primarily was due to higher sales of physical access control solutions in the U.S., resulting from higher overall demand from U.S. Government customers compared to 2014.\nIn our Identity segment, we offer products to secure enterprise information, including PCs, networks, email encryption, login, and printers via delivery of smart card reader products and identity management via our idOnDemand service. Identiv offers smart card readers - a broad range of contact, contactless and mobile smart card readers, tokens and terminals - to enable logical (i.e., PC, network or data) access and security and identification applications, such as national ID, payment, e-Health and e-Government. Our idOnDemand service can be used to provision (i.e., create and issue) and manage identity credentials.\nNet revenue in our Identity segment was $12.0 million in 2015, a decrease of 30% from $17.0 million in 2014. This decrease in Identity segment net revenue in 2015 was primarily the result of significant orders being received in 2014 from our German and Asian customers which were not repeated in 2015, and also reflects continuing economic uncertainty in the international markets we do business in as well as the negative impact of a strong U.S. dollar in 2015 compared to 2014.\nIn our Credentials segment, we offer access cards and RFID and NFC products, including cards, inlays, labels, tags and stickers, as well as other RF components. These products are manufactured in our state-of-the-art facility in Singapore and are used in a diverse range of identity-based applications, including electronic entertainment, loyalty schemes, mobile payment, transit and event ticketing. In our RFID and NFC product business, there is a trend towards a higher overall average selling price as we sell a higher proportion of finished tickets and tags in addition to our inlays. The margins for access cards have been relatively stable.\nNet revenue in our Credentials segment was $27.3 million in 2015, down 34% from $41.6 million in 2014. The Credential net revenue decrease in 2015 was primarily due to the timing of the receipt of orders in North America and Europe for electronic game toy pieces and other Internet of Things applications.\nThe All Other segment includes sales of our Chipdrive brand and Digital Media reader products.\nNet revenue in our All Other segment was $1.5 million in 2015, down 57% from $3.6 million in 2014. Digital Media reader product sales were down significantly in 2015 compared to 2014 and are expected to remain at low levels as certain customers are expected to exit this business.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for 2015 was $23.1 million, or 38% of revenues, compared to $33.5 million or 41% of revenues in 2014. Gross profit represents revenues less direct cost of product sales, manufacturing overhead, other costs directly related to preparing the product for sale including freight, scrap, inventory adjustments and amortization, where applicable. Gross profit margins were down in 2015 primarily related to product mix with significantly higher sales in our lower-margin segments and inventory write downs and reserve adjustments.\nIn our Premises segment, gross profit on sales of physical access control solutions, including panels, controllers, and access readers was $11.5 million in 2015 and $11.4 million in 2014. Gross profit was higher in 2015 as a direct result of higher sales in the Premises segment in 2014. Gross profit margins in the Premises segment were relatively stable ranging from 58% in 2015 to 60% in 2014.\nIn our Identity segment, gross profit on sales of information readers and modules as well as cloud-based credential provisioning and management services was $5.0 million in 2015 compared to $8.2 million in 2014. Gross profit was lower in 2015 as a direct result of lower sales in the Identity segment in 2014. Gross profit margins in the Identity segment were lower in 2015 at 42% compared to 48% in 2014 due to product mix and the negative impact of absorbing fixed overhead over a smaller revenue base in the period.\nIn our Credentials segment, gross profit on sales of RFID & NFC inlays and tags was $5.6 million in 2015 and $11.9 million in 2014. Gross profit was lower in 2015 as a direct result of higher sales of transponders in the Credentials segment in 2014. Gross profit margins in the Credentials segment decreased from 29% in 2014 to 21% in 2015.\nWe expect there will be some variation in our gross profit from period to period, as our gross profit has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including, without limitation, competition, product pricing, the volume of sales in any given quarter, manufacturing volumes, product configuration and mix, the availability of new products, product enhancements, software and services, risk of inventory write-downs and the cost and availability of components.\nOperating Expenses\nInformation about our operating expenses for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 is set forth below.\nResearch and Development\n\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of employee compensation and fees for the development of hardware, software and firmware products. We focus the bulk of our research and development activities on the continued development of existing products and the development of new offerings for emerging market opportunities.\nResearch and development expenses were higher in 2015 primarily due to the transfer of existing employees into research and development and the addition of new employees, leading to higher payroll costs and travel expenses, as well as higher costs for external services and contractors in 2015.\nSelling and Marketing\n\nSelling and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee compensation as well as amortization expense of certain intangible assets, tradeshow participation, advertising and other marketing and selling costs.\nThe level of selling and marketing expenses represents the stabilization of sales and marketing organization headcount and marketing program spending resulting from actions begun in 2013 to simplify our business structure and streamline our operations.\nGeneral and Administrative\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation expenses for employees performing administrative functions, and professional fees incurred for legal, auditing and other consulting services.\nGeneral and administrative spending in 2015 increased from 2014 due to a large increase in legal and professional fees and increases in stock-based compensation.\nEarn-out and Impairment Charges\n\nPursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement entered into on April 29, 2011 between the selling stockholders of idOnDemand, Inc. (the idOnDemand Agreement\u201d) and us, we accrued an earn-out obligation for the year ended December 31, 2014. The estimated earn-out consideration was calculated based on the achievement of specific financial and sales performance targets as defined in the idOnDemand Agreement. The earn-out consideration liability was settled during the quarter ended June 30, 2015 by the issuance of common stock to the selling shareholders.\nAs detailed in Note 6, Goodwill and Intangible Assets in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements, under our accounting policy, we are required to perform an annual impairment review of our goodwill and an interim analysis of our long-lived assets, when there are changes in our business that may indicate impairment of those assets.\nDuring the second quarter of 2015, we noted certain indicators of impairment, including a sustained decline in the price of our common stock and continued reduced performance in our Identity reporting unit. Based on the results of step one of the goodwill impairment analysis, we determined that the net adjusted carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value of the Identity reporting unit. As a result, we concluded that the carrying value of goodwill for our Identity reporting unit was fully impaired and recorded an impairment charge of approximately $1.0 million in our consolidated statements of operations during the second quarter of 2015.\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2015, our stock price declined significantly which resulted in a significant reduction in our fair value and market capitalization. The stock price declined from $3.64 as of October 1, 2015 to $1.99 as of December 31, 2015, and subsequently dropped further, reaching a low of $1.56 in February 2016. Additionally, our net losses continued in the quarter ended December 31, 2015, and we announced a worldwide restructuring plan designed to refocus resources on our core business segments and to consolidate operations in several worldwide locations. As a result, we performed an impairment test and determined that our goodwill was fully impaired based on qualitative factors as the net fair value of the company exceeded its carrying value. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $7.8 million in our consolidated statement of operations in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nIn December 2014, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and found no potential indicators of impairment. In addition, our assessments of long-lived assets during 2015 and 2014 found no indicators of impairment during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nRestructuring and Severance Charges\n\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2014, certain employees related to non-core functions were terminated, the process of transferring corporate financial accounting and reporting from Germany to the U.S. commenced and certain manufacturing facilities were scheduled to close with activities consolidated within existing facilities. As a result, we recorded restructuring and severance charges of $3.1 million primarily related to restructuring, severance and other closure related costs in 2014. During 2015, we recorded an additional $1.3 million in severance costs, as part of management's continuing efforts to simplify business operations.\nSee Note 11, Restructuring and Severance in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information.\nNon-operating Income (Expense)\nInformation about our non-operating income (expense) for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 is set forth below.\n\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net consists of interest on financial liabilities and interest accretion expense for a liability to a former related party arising from our acquisition of Hirsch Electronics Corporation ( Hirsch\u201d), offset by interest earned on invested cash. The higher net interest expense in 2014 is due to our entry into a bank term loan and revolving loan facility on March 31, 2014 with Opus Bank ( Opus\u201d) and repayment of all outstanding amounts under the secured debt facility with Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc. ( Hercules\u201d). In connection with the repayment of our secured debt facility with Hercules, we recorded a $1.6 million charge to interest expense in 2014 in our consolidated statement of operations. The $1.6 million charge to interest expense included $0.9 million related to write-off of deferred costs, $0.6 million related to write-off of discounts on the secured note and $0.1 million related to prepayment fees as stipulated in the Hercules agreement and forfeiture of a facility charge paid at the inception of the agreement.\nSee Note 7, Long-Term Payment Obligation and Note 8, Financial Liabilities in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information on our interest expense and financial obligations.\nForeign Currency (Losses) Gains, Net\nWe recorded net foreign currency losses of $1.2 million and $1.3 million in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Changes in currency valuation in the periods mainly were the result of exchange rate movements between the U.S. dollar and the euro and the Swiss franc and their impact on the valuation of intercompany transaction balances. Accordingly, they are predominantly non-cash items. Our foreign currency gains and losses primarily result from the valuation of current assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the respective entity in the local financial statements.\nIncome Taxes\n\nOur tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amount of income (loss) we earn in jurisdictions, which we expect to be fairly consistent in the near term. It is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year, but are not consistent from year to year. The following items had the most significant impact on the difference between our statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of 34% and our effective tax rate in fiscal years 2015 and 2014.\n2015 - A reduction of $11.7 million, or 30.1% to the statutory rate resulted from changes in valuation allowance during the year. A reduction of $2.6 million, or 6.8% resulted from the impairment of goodwill, and an addition of $1.3 million, or 3.5% resulted from rate differences between U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions. No U.S. taxes were provided with respect to undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as these earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. Significant jurisdictions causing this difference are Germany and Singapore. The net effect of all changes was an income tax expense of $0.1 million recorded in 2015.\n2014 - A reduction of $3.9 million, or 27.0% to the statutory rate resulted from changes in valuation allowance during the year, A reduction of $1.1 million, or 6.8% resulted from the settlement of the earn-out consideration liability, and a reduction of $0.9 million, or 5.5%, resulted from rate differences between U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions. No U.S. taxes were provided with respect to undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as these earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. Significant jurisdictions causing this difference are Germany and Singapore. The net effect of all changes was an income tax expense of $0.1 million recorded in 2014.\nDiscontinued Operations\nIn November 2013, we committed to a plan to sell our Multicard US business and completed the sale of this business on February 4, 2014. Additionally, we entered into an asset purchase agreement to sell certain non-core assets related to one of our subsidiaries to a former employee in June 2014 and completed the sale of these non-core assets in July 2014. All of these businesses (collectively, our divested businesses\u201d) have been accounted for as discontinued operations in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nNo net revenue was recorded for the divested businesses in 2015 and $1.3 million was recorded in 2014. No income from discontinued operations before income taxes was recorded in 2015 and $0.5 million was recorded in 2014.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2015, our working capital, defined as current assets less current liabilities, was $25.1 million, a decrease of $16.9 million compared to $42.0 million as of December 31, 2014. The decrease in working capital reflects a net loss of $39.2 million and changes in operating assets and liabilities negatively impacting our liquidity of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, partially offset by non-cash adjustments of $17.5 million. As of December 31, 2015, our cash balance was $16.7 million.\nThe following summarizes our cash flows for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):\n\nSignificant commitments that will require the use of cash in future periods include obligations under operating leases, our contractual payment obligation assumed upon our acquisition of Hirsch, secured note and revolver, purchase commitments and other obligations. Gross committed operating lease obligations are $4.1 million, our contractual payment obligation assumed upon our acquisition of Hirsch is $6.7 million, the bank term loan, revolving loan facility and interest related obligation is $19.7 million, and purchase commitments and other obligations are $8.2 million at December 31, 2015. Total commitments due within one year are $9.0 million and due thereafter are $29.7 million at December 31, 2015. These commitment levels are based on existing terms of our operating leases, obligations with suppliers, our contractual payment obligation and the existing credit agreement with Opus as of December 31, 2015.\nCash used in operating activities for 2015 primarily was due to the net loss of $39.2 million and decreases in cash from net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $1.3 million which was partially offset by adjustments for certain non-cash items of $17.5 million which primarily consisted of impairment of goodwill, depreciation, amortization, amortization of debt issue costs and stock-based compensation. For 2014, cash used in operating activities primarily was due to the net loss of $17.9 million and a decrease in cash from net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $4.9 million, which were partially offset be adjustments for certain non-cash items of $11.1 million.\nCash used in investing activities for 2015 reflects $0.3 million in capital expenditures. For 2014, cash provided by investing activities reflects $1.4 million in proceeds on sale of discontinued operations, offset by $1.3 million in capital expenditures.\nCash provided by financing activities reflects an additional $4.0 million in proceeds from debt borrowings less cash used to repurchase common stock of $1.9 million. For the year ended December 31, 2014, cash provided by financing activities primarily reflects $14.3 million net cash proceeds from borrowings of debt, less repayments to Opus and $35.8 million net cash proceeds from sales of common stock, partially offset by cash payments of $6.7 million for financial liabilities related to a debt facility repaid in full on March 31, 2014 and $1.7 million for the repurchase of common stock during the year.\nWe consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, if any, as of December 31, 2015, to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no U.S. income taxes have been provided thereon. Generally most of our foreign subsidiaries have accumulated deficits and cash and cash equivalents that are held outside the United States are typically not cash generated from earnings that would be subject to tax upon repatriation if transferred to the United States. We have access to the cash held outside the United States to fund domestic operations and obligations without any material income tax consequences. As of December 31, 2015, the amount of cash included at such subsidiaries was $2.2 million. We have not, nor do we anticipate the need to, repatriate funds to the United States to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business, including liquidity needs associated with our domestic debt service requirements.\nOn October 30, 2012, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the Loan Agreement\u201d) with Hercules. The Loan Agreement provided for a term loan in aggregate principal amount of up to $10.0 million with an initial drawdown of $7.5 million. The initial drawdown of $7.5 million was secured by a secured term promissory note dated October 30, 2012. As discussed below, we repaid all outstanding amounts under the Loan Agreement in connection with the closing of the Credit Agreement with Opus on\nMarch 31, 2014. See Note 8 Financial Liabilities in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information.\nOn April 16, 2013, we entered into a purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement\u201d) with LPC, pursuant to which we have the right to sell to LPC up to $20 million in shares of our common stock, subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement. We directed LPC to purchase 496,500 shares of common stock from January 1, 2014 through September 30, 2014 for net consideration of $4.2 million. See Note 4 Stockholders' Equity, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information.\nOn March 31, 2014, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) with Opus. The Credit Agreement provides for a term loan in the aggregate principal amount of $10.0 million ( Term Loan\u201d) which was drawn down on March 31, 2014, and an additional $10.0 million revolving loan facility ( Revolving Loan Facility\u201d), of which $4.0 million was drawn down on March 31, 2014 and an additional $2.0 million was drawn down during the three months ended June 30, 2014. In connection with the closing of the Credit Agreement, we repaid all outstanding amounts under the Loan Agreement with Hercules. The proceeds of the Term Loan and the initial loans under the Revolving Loan Facility, after payment of fees to Opus and expenses and all outstanding amounts under the Loan Agreement, were approximately $7.8 million. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all assets of the Company. On November 10, 2014 and on December 4, 2015, we amended the Credit Agreement with Opus (the Amended Credit Agreement\u201d) which changes a number of terms of the Credit Agreement including interest charged, the monthly installment payment schedule, the maximum amount available under the revolving loan facility and the maturity date as well as certain other terms and conditions. See Note 8 Financial Liabilities, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information.\nOn December 4, 2015, we entered into an amendment (the Credit Amendment\u201d) to our Credit Agreement with Opus. The Credit Amendment amended and restated Section 7.11(a) Financial Covenants to read as follows: Tangible Net Worth. Permit the sum of the Consolidated Tangible Net Worth plus the amount shown on the Borrower's current balance sheet for the 1994 Settlement Agreement to be less than the sum of $8,000,000 plus, an amount equal to 50% of the amount of any Cash proceeds from any equity or Subordinated Debt issued by the Borrower after December 1, 2015 as of the end of any fiscal quarter of the Borrower measured quarterly beginning at the end of the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2015.\u201d In addition, Opus waived any Default or Event of Default arising under the Credit Agreement due to our the failure to comply with the requirements of Section 7.11(a) of the Credit Agreement (Tangible Net Worth) for the quarter ended September 30, 2015.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with the financial covenants in the Credit Agreement.\nOn September 16, 2014, we sold 2,300,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering at $15.00 per share and also granted the underwriter a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 300,000 shares of common stock to cover overallotments, if any. We received net proceeds of approximately $31.6 million after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable. See Note 4 Stockholders' Equity, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information.\nWe have historically incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from operating activities, and we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2015, we have a total accumulated deficit of $377.8 million. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we sustained a consolidated net loss of $39.2 million. We expect to use a significant amount of cash in our operations over the next twelve months for our operating activities and servicing of financial liabilities, including increased investment in marketing and sales capabilities to drive revenue growth, and continued investment in our cloud-based services, physical access control solutions, smart card reader products and RFID and NFC products.\nWe believe our raising of funds through public and private offerings of equity securities and the increase in our line of credit with Opus provides sufficient working capital to fund operations for the next 12 months. Over the longer term, we believe our existing cash balance, together with available credit under our Amended Credit Agreement with Opus and our ability to raise capital through public and private offerings will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs to fund operations. However, there can be no assurance that additional capital, if required, will be available to us or that such capital will be available to us on acceptable terms.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have not entered into off-balance sheet arrangements, or issued guarantees to third parties.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following summarizes expected cash requirements for contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\n\nOur contractual payment obligation was assumed upon our acquisition of Hirsch. See Note 7, Contractual Payment Obligation, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nFinancial liabilities in the above contractual obligations table include payments to be made for principal and interest in accordance with the terms at December 31, 2015 of the Credit Agreement we entered into with Opus as amended on November 10, 2014 and December 4, 2015. See Note 9, Financial Liabilities, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nWe lease facilities, certain equipment, and automobiles under non-cancelable operating lease agreements. Purchases for inventories are highly dependent upon forecasts of customer demand. Due to the uncertainty in demand from our customers, we may have to change, reschedule, or cancel purchases or purchase orders from our suppliers. These changes may lead to vendor cancellation charges on these orders or contractual commitments. See Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nOur other long-term liabilities include gross unrecognized tax benefits, and related interest and penalties. At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years in connection with these tax liabilities. Accordingly, such amounts are not included in the contractual obligation table above.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors which we believe are reasonable based upon the information available to us at the time these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes the following critical accounting policies contain our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:\n \u00b7 Revenue Recognition; \n \u00b7 Inventory Valuation; \n \u00b7 Income Taxes; \n \u00b7 Goodwill; \n \u00b7 Intangible and Long-lived Assets; and \n \u00b7 Stock-based Compensation. \nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met:\n \u00b7 Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists. We generally rely upon sales contracts or agreements, and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an arrangement. \n \u00b7 Delivery has occurred. We use shipping terms and related documents, or written evidence of customer acceptance, when applicable, to verify delivery or performance. \n \u00b7 Sales price is fixed or determinable. We assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. \n \u00b7 Collectability is reasonably assured. We assess collectability based on creditworthiness of customers as determined by credit checks and customer payment histories. We record accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts, estimated customer returns, and pricing credits. \nWe recognize revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition - Multiple Element Arrangements, and, in certain transactions, ASC 985 Software - Revenue Recognition.\nIn multiple-element arrangements, some sales arrangement are accounted for under the software provisions of ASC 985-605 and others under the provisions that relate to the sale of non-software products.\nIn multiple-element arrangements that include a hardware, bundled with professional services, maintenance contracts, and in some cases with its software products, we evaluate each element, delivered and undelivered, in an arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting. In these multiple element arrangements, revenue is allocated among all elements, delivered and undelivered, based on a vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE\u201d), if available, third-party evidence ( TPE\u201d) if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price ( ESP\u201d) if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. VSOE of selling price is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately. TPE of selling price is established by evaluating largely interchangeable competitor products or services in stand-alone sales to similarly situated customers. The best estimate of selling price is established considering multiple factors, including pricing practices in different geographies and through different sales channels, gross margin objectives, internal costs, competitor pricing strategies and industry technology lifecycles. Some of our offerings contain a significant element of proprietary technology and provide substantially unique features and functionality; as a result, the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality typically cannot be obtained. Additionally, as we are unable to reliably determine what competitors products' selling prices are on a stand-alone basis, typically we are not able to determine TPE for such products. Therefore ESP is used for such products in the selling price hierarchy for allocating the total arrangement consideration.\nIn multiple-element arrangements that include software, we account for each element under the standards of ASC 985-605 related to software. When software is a delivered element, we use the residual method (ASC 605-25) for determining the amount of revenue to recognize for the delivered software component if VSOE for all of the undelivered elements has been established. In sales arrangements where VSOE of fair value has not been established, revenue for all elements is deferred and amortized over the life of the arrangement.\nRevenue from professional services contracts is recognized upon completion of services and customer acceptance, if applicable. Professional services include security system integration, system migration and database conversion services. Revenue from maintenance contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the period of the maintenance contracts. Certain sales arrangement contains hardware, software and professional service elements where professional services are essential to the functionality of the hardware and software system and a test of the functionality of the complete system is required before the customer accepts the system. As a result, hardware, software and professional service elements are accounted for as one unit of accounting and revenue from these arrangements is recognized upon completion of the project.\nInventory Valuation\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost (using FIFO, average cost or standard cost, as applicable) or market (net realizable value). We typically plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand, which can be highly unpredictable and can fluctuate significantly. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record an estimated provision for excess inventory reserve based on judgment and assumptions involving an evaluation of technical obsolescence and our ability to sell based primarily on historical sales patterns and expectations for future demand. Actual demand and market conditions may differ from the projections utilized by management in establishing our inventory reserves. If we were to use different assumptions or utilize different estimates, the amount and timing of our inventory reserves could be materially different. Adverse changes in our inventory reserve valuations could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position.\nIncome Taxes\nOur income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's assessment of estimated current and future income taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, which are expected to result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, for all material jurisdictions, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax balances, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies and results of recent operations. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. The assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating results.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we have federal and state income tax net operating loss ( NOL\u201d) carryforwards of 89.7 million and $17.6 million, respectively, which will expire at various dates starting in 2015. Such NOL carryforwards expire as follows (in thousands):\n\nWe believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit from these NOL carryforwards will not be realized. Accordingly, we have provided a full valuation allowance on any potential deferred tax assets relating to these state NOL carryforwards. If our assumptions change and we determine we will be able to realize these NOLs, the tax benefits relating to any reversal of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2015, will be accounted for as a reduction of income tax expense.\nThe calculation of our tax liabilities involves evaluating uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. ASC 740 states that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, on the basis of the technical merits.\nWe (1) record unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities in accordance with ASC 740 and (2) adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a tax payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is made available.\nWe believe that none of the unrecognized tax benefits, excluding the associated interest and penalties, which are insignificant, may be recognized by the end of 2015.\nWe consider the earnings of all our non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the United States on the basis of estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs and our specific plans for reinvestment of those subsidiary earnings. Should we decide to repatriate foreign earnings, we would need to adjust our income tax provision in the period we determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside the United States.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not subject to amortization but is subject to an annual assessment, at a minimum, for impairment in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other ( ASC 350\u201d). Impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level, which is one level below its operating segment. We evaluate goodwill on an annual basis in the fourth quarter and on an interim basis whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We perform interim goodwill impairment reviews between our annual reviews if certain events and circumstances have occurred, including a deterioration in general economic conditions, an increased competitive environment, a change in management, key personnel, strategy or customers, negative or declining cash flows, or a decline in actual or planned revenue or earnings compared with actual and projected results.\nTo test goodwill for impairment, we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If it is determined it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we test for goodwill impairment using a two-step method as required by ASC 350. The first step of the impairment test compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the\ncarrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, goodwill is considered impaired and a second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. The second step of the impairment test compares the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying value of goodwill and an impairment loss is recognized equal to that difference (i.e., write goodwill down to the implied fair value of goodwill amount).\nFair value of the reporting units is determined using the income, or discounted cash flows approach ( DCF model\u201d) and the reasonableness of such fair value calculations is reviewed using the market approach, which utilizes comparable firms in similar lines of business that are publicly traded or which are part of a public or private transaction. The completion of the DCF model requires that we make a number of significant assumptions to produce an estimate of future cash flows. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, projections of future revenue, gross profit rates, working capital requirements, and discount rates. In determining an appropriate discount rate for each reporting unit we make assumptions about the estimated cost of capital and relevant risks, as appropriate. The projections that we use in our DCF model are updated at least annually and change over time based on historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units. The determination of whether goodwill is impaired involves a significant level of judgment in establishing our assumptions. Changes in our business strategy, government regulations, economic or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments.\nWe believe the methodology that we use to review impairment of goodwill, which includes a significant amount of judgment and estimates, provides us with a reasonable basis to determine whether impairment has occurred. However, many of the factors employed in determining whether our goodwill is impaired are outside of our control and it is reasonably likely that assumptions and estimates will change in future periods. Changes in these factors such as a severe decline in market conditions could result in future impairments to goodwill which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIntangible and Long-lived Assets\nWe evaluate our long-lived assets and certain identifiable amortizable intangible assets for impairment in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment ( ASC 360\u201d) whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets or intangibles may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group. If such asset groups are considered to be impaired (i.e., if the sum of its estimated future undiscounted cash flows used to test for recoverability is less than its carrying value), the impairment loss to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset groups. Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe recognize stock-based compensation expense for all share-based payment awards in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation ( ASC 718\u201d). Stock-based compensation expense for expected-to-vest awards is valued under the single-option approach and amortized on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures. We utilize the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model in order to determine the fair value of stock-based option awards. The Black-Scholes-Merton model requires various highly subjective assumptions including volatility, expected option life, and risk-free interest rate. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent management's best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those expected-to-vest shares. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, our recorded stock-based compensation expense and operating results could be different.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2015-05, Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement\u201d (ASU 2015-05\u201d), which clarifies the circumstances under which a cloud computing customer would account for the arrangement as a license of internal-use software. ASU 2015-05 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-05 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs\u201d ( ASU 2015-03\u201d), which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs on the balance sheet by requiring entities to present such costs as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. ASU 2015-03 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-03 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-01, Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items\u201d ( ASU 2015-01\u201d). Under ASU 2015-01, an entity will no longer be allowed to separately disclose extraordinary items, net of tax, in the income statement after income from continuing operations if an event or transaction is unusual in nature and occurs infrequently. ASU 2015-01 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption, we may elect prospective or retrospective application. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-01 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\u201d, ( ASU 2014-15\u201d), which requires management to perform interim and annual assessments on whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued and to provide related disclosures, if required. The amendments in ASU 2014-15 are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers\" ( ASU 2014-09\u201d), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing U.S. GAAP. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue From Contracts With Customers (Topic 606)\u201d ( ASU 2015-14\u201d), which defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year to annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The new guidance is effective for us beginning January 1, 2018 and will provide us additional time to evaluate the method and impact that ASU 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements.\nTable 102: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_tables": "Table 79: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

Forward-looking Statements: The MD&A contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ significantly from the discussed forecasts.\n\n2. Company Overview: Identiv is a global security technology company that focuses on securing data, physical places, and things across diverse industries.\n\n3. Business Segmentation: Identiv restructured its operations into four reportable business segments: Premises, Identity, Credentials, and All Other, each focusing on distinct solutions and technologies.\n\n4. Net Revenue Trends: In 2015, net revenue was $60.8 million, down 25% compared to $81.2 million in 2014, mainly due to decreased sales in Identity and Credentials segments. The majority of net revenue came from the Credentials segment, and there was a substantial decline in net revenue from Identity, reflecting weakness in sales of smart card readers in Europe and the Middle East.\n\n5. Geographic Revenue: Revenue from the Americas accounted for 67% of total net revenue, while revenue from Europe, the Middle East, and Asia-Pacific accounted for the remaining 33%.\n\n6. Operating Expense Trends: Base operating expenses increased by 22% in 2015 compared to 2014, largely due to higher research and development spending and general and administrative spending.\n\n7. Simplification and Streamlining: Identiv undertook strategic actions to simplify the business structure, streamline operations, and focus resources on core business segments.\n\n8. Restructuring and Severance: Severance and restructuring costs reached $1.3 million in 2015, related to sales and marketing organization restructuring.\n\n9. Income Taxes: The net effect of changes in taxation for 2015 resulted in income tax expenses of $0.1 million.\n\n10. Liquidity and Capital Resources: As of December 31, 2015, working capital was $25.1 million, a decrease from the prior year, and cash provided by financing activities mainly reflected additional proceeds from debt borrowings.\n\n11. Critical Accounting Policies: The report emphasizes the significant estimates and judgments involved in revenue recognition, inventory valuation, income taxes, assessment of goodwill, intangible and long-lived assets, and stock-based compensation.\n\n12. Recent Accounting Pronouncements: Identiv is evaluating the impact of several new or updated accounting standards including the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers, presentation of debt issuance costs, and uncertainties about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern. \n\nThe report suggests that Identiv is focusing on streamlining its operations and is optimistic about leveraging its expertise in RFID, security technology, and customer relationships to grow revenue and capitalize on the Internet of things market. It also acknowledges the challenges faced in the form of economic uncertainty in Europe and operational inefficiencies, which the company is actively addressing through strategic reviews and restructuring efforts."}
