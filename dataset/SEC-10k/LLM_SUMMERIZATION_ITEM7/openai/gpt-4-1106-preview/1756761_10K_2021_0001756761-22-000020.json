MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical data, this discussion contains forward-looking statements about our business, operations and financial performance based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those in this discussion as a result of various factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Part I Item 1A - Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a Maryland corporation formed in October 2018. We invest primarily in stabilized, income-oriented commercial real estate in the United States. To a lesser extent, we also invest in real estate-related securities to provide a source of liquidity for our share repurchase plan, cash management and other purposes. We own, and expect to continue to own, all or substantially all of our assets through our Operating Partnership, of which we are the sole general partner.\nWe are externally managed and advised by our Adviser, a registered investment adviser and an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Invesco Ltd., a leading independent global investment management firm. Our Adviser utilizes the personnel and global resources of Invesco Real Estate to provide investment management services to us. We qualified to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2020. To maintain our REIT qualification, we are generally required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders annually. We operate our business in a manner that permits our exclusion from the definition of Investment Company\u201d under the Investment Company Act.\nOur board of directors will at all times have ultimate oversight and policy-making authority over us, including responsibility for governance, financial controls, compliance and disclosure. However, under our Advisory Agreement, we have delegated to the Adviser the authority to source, evaluate and monitor our investment opportunities and make decisions related to the acquisition, management, financing and disposition of our assets, in accordance with our investment objectives, guidelines, policies and limitations, subject to oversight by our board of directors.\nWe commenced real estate operations in September 2020. As of December 31, 2021, we own or have invested in 38 properties. See -Real Estate\u201d below for additional information on these investments. As of December 31, 2021, we also own real estate-related securities.\nInitial Public Offering\nOn May 14, 2021, the SEC declared our Registration Statement on Form S-11 (File No. 333-254931) for our public offering of common stock effective. We have registered a public offering of up to $3.0 billion in shares of common stock, consisting of up to $2.4 billion in shares in our Primary Offering and up to $600 million in shares under our distribution reinvestment plan. We are offering to sell any combination of five classes of shares of our common stock, Class T shares, Class S shares, Class D shares, Class I shares and Class E shares in the Offering, with a dollar value up to the maximum offering amount. The share classes have different upfront selling commissions and dealer manager fees and different ongoing stockholder servicing fees. The purchase price per share for each class of our common stock sold in the Offering will vary and will generally equal our prior month's NAV per share for such class, as determined monthly, plus any applicable upfront selling commissions and dealer manager fees.\nAs of March 28, 2022, we have received aggregate proceeds of approximately $62.1 million from the Offering. We intend to continue selling shares on a monthly basis.\nPrivate Offerings\nWe are conducting private offerings of up to $1.0 billion in shares of our Class N common stock ( Class N shares\u201d or Class N common stock\u201d) (the Class N Private Offering\u201d) and up to $20 million in shares of our Class E common stock (the Class E Private Offering\u201d) (collectively, the Private Offerings\u201d). As of March 28, 2022, we issued 14,168,780 shares of Class N common stock to affiliates of the Company in the Class N Private Offering for total net proceeds of $398.6 million after deducting offering costs of $1.1 million. As of March 28, 2022, we have a commitment from an affiliate to purchase an additional $85.5 million of Class N common stock, excluding a $30 million commitment from Invesco Realty, Inc. that collateralizes our revolving credit facility. As of March 28, 2022, we issued 73,676 shares of Class E common stock to affiliates of the Company in the Class E Private Offering for total proceeds of $2.2 million. As of March 28, 2022, we have repurchased $70.0 million of Class N shares funded by proceeds from both the Offering and the Private Offerings. All of the Class N shares that were repurchased were classified as redeemable common stock on our consolidated balance sheets.\n2021 Highlights\nOperating Results\n\u2022Declared monthly net distributions totaling $11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.

Our rental property operating expenses generally include the costs of ownership of real estate, including insurance, utilities, real estate taxes and repair and maintenance expense. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we acquired eight properties and assumed the underlying tenant leases when we acquired the properties.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, general and administrative expenses were $4.0 million and consisted primarily of accounting, audit and tax fees, legal fees, other professional services fees and directors' expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2020, general and administrative expenses were $2.9 million and consisted primarily of organization costs related to our Class N Private Offering.\nIncome (Loss) from Unconsolidated Entities, Net\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized income from unconsolidated entities of $3.1 million. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred a net loss from unconsolidated entities of $0.1 million.\nPerformance Participation Interest\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the performance participation interest accrual was $3.3 million. There was no performance participation interest accrual for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, depreciation and amortization expenses were $10.5 million and approximately $37,000, respectively, driven by depreciation and amortization on our consolidated properties.\nInterest Expense\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we incurred interest expense of $3.0 million and $0.3 million, respectively, that primarily consists of interest expense on our mortgage notes and revolving credit facility. Interest expense also includes amortization of deferred financing costs related to obtaining our mortgage loans and revolving credit facility. See - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d below as well as Note 8 - Borrowings\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of our borrowing arrangements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWhile the long-term impact of COVID-19 to our business is not yet known, we believe that with respect to liquidity, we are well positioned with $162.4 million of immediate liquidity as of December 31, 2021, made up of $20.1 million of undrawn capacity on our revolving credit facility, $13.8 million of cash on hand, and $128.5 million of uncalled capital commitments. In addition, we hold $12.7 million in investments in real estate-related securities that could be liquidated to satisfy any potential liquidity requirements.\nOur primary needs for liquidity and capital resources are to fund our investments, to make distributions to our stockholders, to repurchase shares of our common stock under our share repurchase plan, to pay our offering costs and operating fees and expenses and to pay interest on our borrowings. We will obtain the funds required to purchase investments and conduct our operations from the net proceeds of our Private Offerings, our Primary Offering and any future offerings we may conduct, from secured and unsecured borrowings from banks and other lenders and from any undistributed funds from operations. Generally, cash needs for items other than asset acquisitions are met from operations, and cash needs for asset acquisitions are funded by our Private Offerings, the Offering and debt financings. However, there may be a delay between the sale of our shares and our purchase of assets that could result in a delay in the benefits to our stockholders, if any, of returns generated from our investment operations.\nOur target leverage ratio after we have raised substantial offering proceeds and acquired a broad portfolio of real estate investments is approximately 50% to 60%. We calculate our leverage ratio\u201d by dividing (1) the sum of our consolidated property-level debt, entity-level debt, and allocation of debt from investments in real estate funds managed by the Adviser or its affiliates in which we may invest, net of cash and restricted cash, by (2) the asset value of our real estate investments and equity in our real estate-related securities portfolio (in each case measured using the greater of fair market value and cost of gross real estate), including our investments in unconsolidated entities. Our leverage ratio calculation does not include (i) indebtedness incurred in connection with funding a deposit in advance of the closing of an investment, (ii) indebtedness incurred as other working capital advances, (iii) indebtedness on our real estate securities investments, or (iv) the pro rata share of debt within our unconsolidated investments. Our charter prohibits us from borrowing more than 300% of our net assets, which approximates borrowing 75% of the cost of our investments. We may exceed this limit if a majority of our independent directors approves each borrowing in excess of the limit and we disclose the justification for doing so to our stockholders.\nIf we are unable to raise substantial funds in the Offering or Private Offerings, we will make fewer investments resulting in less diversification in terms of the type, number and size of investments we make. Further, we have certain fixed operating expenses, including certain expenses as a publicly offered REIT, regardless of whether we are able to raise substantial funds in the Offering and Private Offerings. Our inability to raise substantial funds would increase our fixed operating expenses as a percentage of gross income, reducing our net income and limiting our ability to make distributions.\nOur offering and operating fees and expenses include, among other things, the management fee we pay to the Adviser, the performance participation interest that INREIT OP will pay to the Special Limited Partner, stockholder servicing fees we will pay to the Dealer Manager, legal, audit and valuation expenses, federal and state filing fees, printing expenses, administrative fees, transfer agent fees, marketing and distribution expenses and fees related to acquiring, financing, appraising and managing our properties. The Adviser and its affiliates provide us with our management team, including our officers and appropriate support personnel. The Adviser or the Adviser's affiliates may provide us services that would otherwise be performed by third parties. In such event, we will reimburse the Adviser or the Adviser's affiliate the cost of performing such services provided that such reimbursements will not exceed the amount that would be payable if such services were provided by a third party in an arms-length transaction.\nThe Adviser has agreed to advance all of our operating expenses on our behalf through the earlier of (1) the date that our NAV reaches $500 million and (2) December 31, 2021. These advanced expenses will be reimbursed to the Adviser pro rata over 60 months beginning January 1, 2022. We will reimburse the Adviser for any subsequent offering expenses as incurred. As of December 31, 2021, the Adviser has advanced $6.4 million of general and administrative expenses on our behalf.\nThe Adviser has agreed to advance all of our organization and offering expenses on our behalf (other than upfront selling commissions, dealer manager fees and ongoing stockholder servicing fees) through the earlier of (1) the date that our NAV reaches $1.0 billion and (2) December 31, 2022, at which time we will reimburse the Adviser for all of our advanced expenses ratably over 60 months. We will reimburse the Adviser for any subsequent organization and offering expenses as incurred. As of December 31, 2021, the Adviser had incurred offering expenses of $1.1 million and organization costs of $1.2 million on our behalf in connection with the Private Offerings, that are recorded as a component of due to affiliates on our consolidated balance sheets. The Adviser and its affiliates have also incurred organization and offering expenses of $3.4 million on our behalf in connection with the Offering that are recorded as a component of due to affiliates on our consolidated balance sheets.\nUnder our charter, we may reimburse the Adviser, at the end of each fiscal quarter, for total operating expenses paid by the Adviser. However, commencing with the quarter ended September 30, 2021, we may not reimburse the Adviser at the end of any fiscal quarter for total operating expenses (as defined in our charter) that, in the four consecutive fiscal quarters then ended, exceed the greater of 2% of average invested assets or 25% of net income determined without reduction for any additions to reserves for depreciation, bad debts or other similar non-cash reserves and excluding any gain from the sale of our assets for that period (the 2%/25% Guidelines\u201d).\nWe may reimburse the Adviser for expenses in excess of the 2%/25% Guidelines if a majority of our independent directors determines that such excess expenses (an Excess Amount\u201d) are justified based on unusual and non-recurring factors.\nFor the four fiscal quarters ended December 31, 2021, our total operating expenses of $7.1 million exceeded the 2%/25% Guidelines by $0.7 million. Our independent directors determined that the Excess Amount of total operating expenses for the four quarters ended December 31, 2021 was justified, and therefore will be reimbursed to the Adviser, because (1) the amounts reflect legitimate operating expenses necessary for the operation of our business, (2) we are currently in the initial acquisition stage of the business and our average invested assets grew by 65% between the first and second halves of 2021 as we closed on five investments in the three months ended December 31, 2021, (3) the expenses incurred as a result of being a public company (including expenses for audit and legal services, director and officer liability insurance and fees for directors) are significant and disproportionate to our average invested assets and net income and (4) we have experienced outsized performance during this period resulting in an increased performance participation interest. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our Total Operating Expenses were 2.2% and 89.5% of each of our Average Invested Assets and our Net Income, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our indebtedness includes a revolving credit facility, three mortgages secured by their corresponding properties and a financing obligation.\nOn September 23, 2020, INREIT OP entered into a revolving credit facility with Bank of America, N.A. ( Bank of America\u201d). During the year ended December 31, 2021, we entered into a new revolving credit facility ( Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) and repaid our previous revolving credit facility.\nThe following is a summary of the revolving credit facility:\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$ in thousands </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Indebtedness </td> <td> </td> <td>Interest Rate </td> <td> </td> <td>Maturity Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Maximum Facility Size (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Principal Outstanding Balance </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving Credit Facility </td> <td> </td> <td>L + applicable margin(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1/22/2024 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>100,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>75,500 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$ in thousands </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Indebtedness </td> <td> </td> <td>Interest Rate </td> <td> </td> <td>Maturity Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Maximum Facility Size </td> <td> </td> <td>Principal Outstanding Balance </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving Credit Facility </td> <td> </td> <td>L + applicable margin(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>9/22/2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>75,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>67,700 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to daily adjusted one-month LIBOR or a base rate, where the base rate is the highest of (1) federal funds rate plus 0.5%, (2) the rate of interest as publicly announced by Bank of America as its prime rate\u201d or (3) the one-month LIBOR rate plus 1.0%, in each case, plus an applicable margin that is based on our leverage ratio. The weighted-average interest rate for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, was 1.72% and 2.00%, respectively.\n(2)As of December 31, 2021, the borrowing capacity on the Revolving Credit Facility is $20.1 million. The borrowing capacity is less than the difference between the maximum facility size and the current principal outstanding balance as the calculation of borrowing capacity is limited by the aggregate fair value and cash flows of our unencumbered properties. On January 21, 2022, we entered into an amendment for our Revolving Credit Facility which increased our maximum facility size from $100 million to $150 million and converted the benchmark interest rate for all outstanding borrowings from daily adjusted one-month LIBOR to Term SOFR with a borrowing period of one month.\nThe following table summarizes certain characteristics of our mortgage notes that are secured by our properties:\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$ in thousands </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Principal Balance Outstanding </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Indebtedness </td> <td> </td> <td>Interest Rate(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Maturity Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Maximum Principal Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cortona Apartments </td> <td> </td> <td>L + applicable margin(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>6/1/2028 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bixby Kennesaw </td> <td> </td> <td>L + applicable margin(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>9/24/2026 </td> <td> </td> <td>53,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tempe Student Housing </td> <td> </td> <td>L + applicable margin(4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1/01/2025 </td> <td> </td> <td>65,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total mortgages payable </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>163,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred financing costs, net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,847) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgages payable, net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>161,653 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)The term L\u201d refers to the relevant floating benchmark rates, which include USD LIBOR and SOFR, as applicable to each loan. The mortgage agreements that utilize LIBOR contain LIBOR replacement language.\n(2)The mortgage note secured by the Cortona Apartments bears interest at the greater of (a) 2.65% or (b) the sum of (i) 2.40% plus (ii) one-month LIBOR. The weighted-average interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 2.65%.\n(3)The mortgage note secured by Bixby Kennesaw bears interest at the sum of (i) 1.60% plus (ii) one-month LIBOR. The weighted-average interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 1.69%.\n(4)The mortgage note secured by Tempe Student Housing bears interest at (i) 1.75% plus (ii) 30-Day SOFR Average as published on the website of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The weighted-average interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 1.80%.\nIn connection with the acquisition of Tempe Student Housing in December 2021, we entered into a sale and leaseback transaction whereby we sold Tempe Student Housing to an unaffiliated third party for $54.0 million and simultaneously entered into a lease agreement with the same unaffiliated third party to lease the property back over a 104 year lease term. The lease requires an initial annual lease payment of $1.4 million, subject to annual increases whereby the new lease payment will equal 102% of the prior year's lease payment plus periodic adjustments based on the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items.\nThe sale and leaseback of Tempe Student Housing is accounted for as a failed sale and leaseback because the lease is classified as a finance lease. Accordingly, the sale of Tempe Student Housing is not recognized and the property continues to be included within our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We will continue to depreciate the property as if we were the legal owner. The proceeds received from the sale, net of debt issuance costs of $0.4 million, are accounted for as a financing obligation on our consolidated balance sheets in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We allocate the rental payments under the lease between interest expense and principal repayment of the financing obligation using the effective interest method. The total principal payments will not exceed the difference between the gross proceeds from the sale of $54.0 million and the initial carrying value of the land of $17.6 million, resulting in maximum principal payments of $36.4 million over the term of the arrangement.\nSee Note 8 - Borrowings\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of our borrowing arrangements.\nOther potential future sources of capital include incremental secured or unsecured financings from banks or other lenders and proceeds from the sale of assets. If necessary, we may use financings or other sources of capital in the event of unforeseen significant capital expenditures. We have not yet identified any sources for these types of financings.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $13.8 million and restricted cash of $1.7 million. Our restricted cash primarily consists of an interest reserve that we are contractually required to maintain on deposit under the terms of our preferred membership interest in a limited liability company. Restricted cash also includes amounts in escrow for taxes and insurance related to mortgages at certain properties, as well as security deposits.\nWe hold a preferred membership interest in an unconsolidated limited liability company that owns the San Simeon Apartments and have committed to fund improvements to the San Simeon Apartments. We are required to fund these commitments as requested through December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2021, our undrawn capital commitment was $3.7 million.\nWe have committed to fund up to $3.5 million of tenant improvements at our Willows Facility through May 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2021, we have funded $3.1 million.\nWe believe that our current level of cash and borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility, together with expected future cash flows from our Offering, Private Offerings and future operations, will be sufficient to meet the needs of our existing operations and planned requirements for the foreseeable future.\nCash Flows\nThe following table provides a breakdown of the net change in our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash:\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$ in thousands </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Period October 28, 2019 (date of initial capitalization) through\nDecember 31, 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows provided by operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,604 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>560 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows used in investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(443,151) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(156,995) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows provided by financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>445,328 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>159,953 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>200 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,781 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,518 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>200 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities - Cash flows provided by operating activities increased $9.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the corresponding period in 2020 due to an increase in cash flows from operations from our investments in real estate as a result of growth in the size of our portfolio, positive leasing activity and income distributions from our equity investments in unconsolidated entities. Cash flows provided by operating activities increased $0.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the corresponding period in 2019 due to our net loss of $3.3 million adjusted for non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. We commenced operations in September 2020; accordingly, net cash provided by operating activities does not reflect a full year of operations.\nInvesting Activities - Cash flows used in investing activities increased $286.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the corresponding period in 2020 primarily due to an increase in our investments of $353.7 million in real estate, capital improvements to real estate and real-estate related securities, offset by a decrease in our investment in unconsolidated entities of $60.6 million. Cash flows used in investing activities increased $157.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the corresponding period in 2019 as we commenced real estate operations in September 2020.\nFinancing Activities - Cash flows provided by financing activities increased $285.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the corresponding period in 2020 primarily due to an increase in net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock of $206.4 million, and an increase in proceeds from borrowings of $285.3 million from the Revolving Credit Facility, mortgages payable and a financing obligation, offset primarily by increases in repayments under the Revolving Credit Facility of $127.7 million and repurchases of our common stock of $70.0 million. Cash flows provided by financing activities increased $159.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the corresponding period in 2019 as we commenced real estate operations in September 2020.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires the use of estimates and assumptions that involve the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties. Accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties. All of these estimates reflect our best judgment about current, and for some estimates, future economic and market conditions and their effects based on information available as of the date of these financial statements. If conditions change from those expected, it is possible that materially different amounts could be reported in our financial statements.\nPurchase Price Allocation of Acquired Real Estate\nUpon the acquisition of a property, we assess the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities (including land, buildings, tenant improvements, above-market and below-market leases, acquired in-place leases, other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities) and allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities on a relative fair value basis in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification 805, Business Combinations. All expenses related to the acquisition are capitalized and allocated among the identified assets. Generally, the most significant portion of the allocation is to building and land and requires the use of market-based estimates and assumptions.\nWe estimate value using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers (e.g., discounted cash flow analysis). Factors considered in our analysis include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods, considering current market rental rates and costs to execute similar leases. We also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired. In estimating carrying costs, management also includes real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on specific local cap rates and discount rates. We also estimate costs to execute similar leases, including leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses to the extent that such costs are not already incurred in connection with a new lease origination as part of the transaction. We also consider the nature and extent of our existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant's credit quality and management's expectations of lease renewals (including those existing under the terms of the lease agreement), among other factors. A change in any of the assumptions above, which are subjective, could have a material impact on our results of operations.\nThe allocation of the purchase price directly affects the following in our consolidated financial statements:\n\u2022the amount of purchase price allocated to the various tangible and intangible assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets;\n\u2022the amounts allocated to the value of above-market and below-market lease values are amortized to rental income over the remaining non-cancelable terms of the respective leases. The amounts allocated to all other tangible and intangible assets are amortized to depreciation or amortization expense. Thus, depending on the amounts allocated between land and other depreciable assets, changes in the purchase price allocation among our assets could have a material impact on our FFO, a metric which is used by many REIT investors to evaluate our operating performance; and\n\u2022the period of time over which tangible and intangible assets are depreciated varies greatly, and thus, changes in the amounts allocated to these assets will have a direct impact on our results of operations. Intangible assets are generally amortized over the respective life of the leases. Also, we depreciate our buildings over up to 40 years, but do not depreciate our land. These differences in timing could have a material impact on our results of operations.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nOur estimate of the expected future cash flows used in testing for impairment is subjective and based on, among other things, our estimates regarding future market conditions, rental rates, occupancy levels, costs of tenant improvements, assumptions regarding the residual value of our properties at the end of our anticipated holding period, discount rates, exit capitalization rates and the length of our anticipated holding period. In preparing the projection of undiscounted future cash flows, we estimate exit capitalization rates and market rental rates using information that we obtain from market comparability studies and other comparable sources, and apply the undiscounted cash flows against our expected holding period. These assumptions could differ materially from actual results. If changes in our strategy or the market conditions result in a reduction in the holding period and an earlier sale date, an impairment loss could be recognized and such loss could be material. If impairment were indicated, the carrying value of the property would be written down to its estimated fair value based on our best estimate of the property's discounted future cash flows using market derived capitalization rates, discount rates and market rental rates applied against our expected hold period.\nUsing the methodology discussed above, we evaluated our entire portfolio, as of December 31, 2021, for any impairment indicators and performed an impairment analysis on select properties that had an indication of impairment. No such strategy changes or market conditions have been identified as of December 31, 2021. We did not record any impairment losses for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nRedeemable Common Stock\nWe report our redeemable common stock on our consolidated balance sheets at MassMutual's redemption value. MassMutual's redemption value is determined based on our NAV per Class N share as of our balance sheet date. For purposes of determining our NAV, our investments in real estate are recorded at fair value based on third party valuations prepared by licensed appraisers in accordance with standard industry practice.\nThese fair value estimates of our investments in real estate are particularly important as they are used for the calculation of NAV, which determines the adjustment to the carrying value of our redeemable common stock. Significant differences in the fair value of our redeemable common stock may result from changes in market conditions that cause our NAV, and thus MassMutual's redemption value, to increase or decrease during the period. Although increases and decreases in our NAV do not have an impact to our consolidated statements of operations, they would cause a significant change in our equity.\nPending Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of pending accounting pronouncements.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical data, this discussion contains forward-looking statements about our business, operations and financial performance based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those in this discussion as a result of various factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Part I Item 1A - Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a Maryland corporation formed in October 2018. We invest primarily in stabilized, income-oriented commercial real estate in the United States. To a lesser extent, we also invest in real estate-related securities to provide a source of liquidity for our share repurchase plan, cash management and other purposes. We own, and expect to continue to own, all or substantially all of our assets through our Operating Partnership, of which we are the sole general partner.\nWe are externally managed and advised by our Adviser, a registered investment adviser and an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Invesco Ltd., a leading independent global investment management firm. Our Adviser utilizes the personnel and global resources of Invesco Real Estate to provide investment management services to us. We qualified to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2020. To maintain our REIT qualification, we are generally required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders annually. We operate our business in a manner that permits our exclusion from the definition of Investment Company\u201d under the Investment Company Act.\nOur board of directors will at all times have ultimate oversight and policy-making authority over us, including responsibility for governance, financial controls, compliance and disclosure. However, under our Advisory Agreement, we have delegated to the Adviser the authority to source, evaluate and monitor our investment opportunities and make decisions related to the acquisition, management, financing and disposition of our assets, in accordance with our investment objectives, guidelines, policies and limitations, subject to oversight by our board of directors.\nWe commenced real estate operations in September 2020. As of December 31, 2021, we own or have invested in 38 properties. See -Real Estate\u201d below for additional information on these investments. As of December 31, 2021, we also own real estate-related securities.\nInitial Public Offering\nOn May 14, 2021, the SEC declared our Registration Statement on Form S-11 (File No. 333-254931) for our public offering of common stock effective. We have registered a public offering of up to $3.0 billion in shares of common stock, consisting of up to $2.4 billion in shares in our Primary Offering and up to $600 million in shares under our distribution reinvestment plan. We are offering to sell any combination of five classes of shares of our common stock, Class T shares, Class S shares, Class D shares, Class I shares and Class E shares in the Offering, with a dollar value up to the maximum offering amount. The share classes have different upfront selling commissions and dealer manager fees and different ongoing stockholder servicing fees. The purchase price per share for each class of our common stock sold in the Offering will vary and will generally equal our prior month's NAV per share for such class, as determined monthly, plus any applicable upfront selling commissions and dealer manager fees.\nAs of March 28, 2022, we have received aggregate proceeds of approximately $62.1 million from the Offering. We intend to continue selling shares on a monthly basis.\nPrivate Offerings\nWe are conducting private offerings of up to $1.0 billion in shares of our Class N common stock ( Class N shares\u201d or Class N common stock\u201d) (the Class N Private Offering\u201d) and up to $20 million in shares of our Class E common stock (the Class E Private Offering\u201d) (collectively, the Private Offerings\u201d). As of March 28, 2022, we issued 14,168,780 shares of Class N common stock to affiliates of the Company in the Class N Private Offering for total net proceeds of $398.6 million after deducting offering costs of $1.1 million. As of March 28, 2022, we have a commitment from an affiliate to purchase an additional $85.5 million of Class N common stock, excluding a $30 million commitment from Invesco Realty, Inc. that collateralizes our revolving credit facility. As of March 28, 2022, we issued 73,676 shares of Class E common stock to affiliates of the Company in the Class E Private Offering for total proceeds of $2.2 million. As of March 28, 2022, we have repurchased $70.0 million of Class N shares funded by proceeds from both the Offering and the Private Offerings. All of the Class N shares that were repurchased were classified as redeemable common stock on our consolidated balance sheets.\n2021 Highlights\nOperating Results\n\u2022Declared monthly net distributions totaling $11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.

Our rental property operating expenses generally include the costs of ownership of real estate, including insurance, utilities, real estate taxes and repair and maintenance expense. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we acquired eight properties and assumed the underlying tenant leases when we acquired the properties.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, general and administrative expenses were $4.0 million and consisted primarily of accounting, audit and tax fees, legal fees, other professional services fees and directors' expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2020, general and administrative expenses were $2.9 million and consisted primarily of organization costs related to our Class N Private Offering.\nIncome (Loss) from Unconsolidated Entities, Net\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized income from unconsolidated entities of $3.1 million. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred a net loss from unconsolidated entities of $0.1 million.\nPerformance Participation Interest\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the performance participation interest accrual was $3.3 million. There was no performance participation interest accrual for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, depreciation and amortization expenses were $10.5 million and approximately $37,000, respectively, driven by depreciation and amortization on our consolidated properties.\nInterest Expense\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we incurred interest expense of $3.0 million and $0.3 million, respectively, that primarily consists of interest expense on our mortgage notes and revolving credit facility. Interest expense also includes amortization of deferred financing costs related to obtaining our mortgage loans and revolving credit facility. See - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d below as well as Note 8 - Borrowings\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of our borrowing arrangements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWhile the long-term impact of COVID-19 to our business is not yet known, we believe that with respect to liquidity, we are well positioned with $162.4 million of immediate liquidity as of December 31, 2021, made up of $20.1 million of undrawn capacity on our revolving credit facility, $13.8 million of cash on hand, and $128.5 million of uncalled capital commitments. In addition, we hold $12.7 million in investments in real estate-related securities that could be liquidated to satisfy any potential liquidity requirements.\nOur primary needs for liquidity and capital resources are to fund our investments, to make distributions to our stockholders, to repurchase shares of our common stock under our share repurchase plan, to pay our offering costs and operating fees and expenses and to pay interest on our borrowings. We will obtain the funds required to purchase investments and conduct our operations from the net proceeds of our Private Offerings, our Primary Offering and any future offerings we may conduct, from secured and unsecured borrowings from banks and other lenders and from any undistributed funds from operations. Generally, cash needs for items other than asset acquisitions are met from operations, and cash needs for asset acquisitions are funded by our Private Offerings, the Offering and debt financings. However, there may be a delay between the sale of our shares and our purchase of assets that could result in a delay in the benefits to our stockholders, if any, of returns generated from our investment operations.\nOur target leverage ratio after we have raised substantial offering proceeds and acquired a broad portfolio of real estate investments is approximately 50% to 60%. We calculate our leverage ratio\u201d by dividing (1) the sum of our consolidated property-level debt, entity-level debt, and allocation of debt from investments in real estate funds managed by the Adviser or its affiliates in which we may invest, net of cash and restricted cash, by (2) the asset value of our real estate investments and equity in our real estate-related securities portfolio (in each case measured using the greater of fair market value and cost of gross real estate), including our investments in unconsolidated entities. Our leverage ratio calculation does not include (i) indebtedness incurred in connection with funding a deposit in advance of the closing of an investment, (ii) indebtedness incurred as other working capital advances, (iii) indebtedness on our real estate securities investments, or (iv) the pro rata share of debt within our unconsolidated investments. Our charter prohibits us from borrowing more than 300% of our net assets, which approximates borrowing 75% of the cost of our investments. We may exceed this limit if a majority of our independent directors approves each borrowing in excess of the limit and we disclose the justification for doing so to our stockholders.\nIf we are unable to raise substantial funds in the Offering or Private Offerings, we will make fewer investments resulting in less diversification in terms of the type, number and size of investments we make. Further, we have certain fixed operating expenses, including certain expenses as a publicly offered REIT, regardless of whether we are able to raise substantial funds in the Offering and Private Offerings. Our inability to raise substantial funds would increase our fixed operating expenses as a percentage of gross income, reducing our net income and limiting our ability to make distributions.\nOur offering and operating fees and expenses include, among other things, the management fee we pay to the Adviser, the performance participation interest that INREIT OP will pay to the Special Limited Partner, stockholder servicing fees we will pay to the Dealer Manager, legal, audit and valuation expenses, federal and state filing fees, printing expenses, administrative fees, transfer agent fees, marketing and distribution expenses and fees related to acquiring, financing, appraising and managing our properties. The Adviser and its affiliates provide us with our management team, including our officers and appropriate support personnel. The Adviser or the Adviser's affiliates may provide us services that would otherwise be performed by third parties. In such event, we will reimburse the Adviser or the Adviser's affiliate the cost of performing such services provided that such reimbursements will not exceed the amount that would be payable if such services were provided by a third party in an arms-length transaction.\nThe Adviser has agreed to advance all of our operating expenses on our behalf through the earlier of (1) the date that our NAV reaches $500 million and (2) December 31, 2021. These advanced expenses will be reimbursed to the Adviser pro rata over 60 months beginning January 1, 2022. We will reimburse the Adviser for any subsequent offering expenses as incurred. As of December 31, 2021, the Adviser has advanced $6.4 million of general and administrative expenses on our behalf.\nThe Adviser has agreed to advance all of our organization and offering expenses on our behalf (other than upfront selling commissions, dealer manager fees and ongoing stockholder servicing fees) through the earlier of (1) the date that our NAV reaches $1.0 billion and (2) December 31, 2022, at which time we will reimburse the Adviser for all of our advanced expenses ratably over 60 months. We will reimburse the Adviser for any subsequent organization and offering expenses as incurred. As of December 31, 2021, the Adviser had incurred offering expenses of $1.1 million and organization costs of $1.2 million on our behalf in connection with the Private Offerings, that are recorded as a component of due to affiliates on our consolidated balance sheets. The Adviser and its affiliates have also incurred organization and offering expenses of $3.4 million on our behalf in connection with the Offering that are recorded as a component of due to affiliates on our consolidated balance sheets.\nUnder our charter, we may reimburse the Adviser, at the end of each fiscal quarter, for total operating expenses paid by the Adviser. However, commencing with the quarter ended September 30, 2021, we may not reimburse the Adviser at the end of any fiscal quarter for total operating expenses (as defined in our charter) that, in the four consecutive fiscal quarters then ended, exceed the greater of 2% of average invested assets or 25% of net income determined without reduction for any additions to reserves for depreciation, bad debts or other similar non-cash reserves and excluding any gain from the sale of our assets for that period (the 2%/25% Guidelines\u201d).\nWe may reimburse the Adviser for expenses in excess of the 2%/25% Guidelines if a majority of our independent directors determines that such excess expenses (an Excess Amount\u201d) are justified based on unusual and non-recurring factors.\nFor the four fiscal quarters ended December 31, 2021, our total operating expenses of $7.1 million exceeded the 2%/25% Guidelines by $0.7 million. Our independent directors determined that the Excess Amount of total operating expenses for the four quarters ended December 31, 2021 was justified, and therefore will be reimbursed to the Adviser, because (1) the amounts reflect legitimate operating expenses necessary for the operation of our business, (2) we are currently in the initial acquisition stage of the business and our average invested assets grew by 65% between the first and second halves of 2021 as we closed on five investments in the three months ended December 31, 2021, (3) the expenses incurred as a result of being a public company (including expenses for audit and legal services, director and officer liability insurance and fees for directors) are significant and disproportionate to our average invested assets and net income and (4) we have experienced outsized performance during this period resulting in an increased performance participation interest. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our Total Operating Expenses were 2.2% and 89.5% of each of our Average Invested Assets and our Net Income, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our indebtedness includes a revolving credit facility, three mortgages secured by their corresponding properties and a financing obligation.\nOn September 23, 2020, INREIT OP entered into a revolving credit facility with Bank of America, N.A. ( Bank of America\u201d). During the year ended December 31, 2021, we entered into a new revolving credit facility ( Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) and repaid our previous revolving credit facility.\nThe following is a summary of the revolving credit facility:\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$ in thousands </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Indebtedness </td> <td> </td> <td>Interest Rate </td> <td> </td> <td>Maturity Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Maximum Facility Size (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Principal Outstanding Balance </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving Credit Facility </td> <td> </td> <td>L + applicable margin(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1/22/2024 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>100,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>75,500 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$ in thousands </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Indebtedness </td> <td> </td> <td>Interest Rate </td> <td> </td> <td>Maturity Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Maximum Facility Size </td> <td> </td> <td>Principal Outstanding Balance </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving Credit Facility </td> <td> </td> <td>L + applicable margin(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>9/22/2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>75,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>67,700 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to daily adjusted one-month LIBOR or a base rate, where the base rate is the highest of (1) federal funds rate plus 0.5%, (2) the rate of interest as publicly announced by Bank of America as its prime rate\u201d or (3) the one-month LIBOR rate plus 1.0%, in each case, plus an applicable margin that is based on our leverage ratio. The weighted-average interest rate for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, was 1.72% and 2.00%, respectively.\n(2)As of December 31, 2021, the borrowing capacity on the Revolving Credit Facility is $20.1 million. The borrowing capacity is less than the difference between the maximum facility size and the current principal outstanding balance as the calculation of borrowing capacity is limited by the aggregate fair value and cash flows of our unencumbered properties. On January 21, 2022, we entered into an amendment for our Revolving Credit Facility which increased our maximum facility size from $100 million to $150 million and converted the benchmark interest rate for all outstanding borrowings from daily adjusted one-month LIBOR to Term SOFR with a borrowing period of one month.\nThe following table summarizes certain characteristics of our mortgage notes that are secured by our properties:\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$ in thousands </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Principal Balance Outstanding </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Indebtedness </td> <td> </td> <td>Interest Rate(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Maturity Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Maximum Principal Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cortona Apartments </td> <td> </td> <td>L + applicable margin(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>6/1/2028 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bixby Kennesaw </td> <td> </td> <td>L + applicable margin(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>9/24/2026 </td> <td> </td> <td>53,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tempe Student Housing </td> <td> </td> <td>L + applicable margin(4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1/01/2025 </td> <td> </td> <td>65,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total mortgages payable </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>163,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred financing costs, net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,847) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgages payable, net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>161,653 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)The term L\u201d refers to the relevant floating benchmark rates, which include USD LIBOR and SOFR, as applicable to each loan. The mortgage agreements that utilize LIBOR contain LIBOR replacement language.\n(2)The mortgage note secured by the Cortona Apartments bears interest at the greater of (a) 2.65% or (b) the sum of (i) 2.40% plus (ii) one-month LIBOR. The weighted-average interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 2.65%.\n(3)The mortgage note secured by Bixby Kennesaw bears interest at the sum of (i) 1.60% plus (ii) one-month LIBOR. The weighted-average interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 1.69%.\n(4)The mortgage note secured by Tempe Student Housing bears interest at (i) 1.75% plus (ii) 30-Day SOFR Average as published on the website of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The weighted-average interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 1.80%.\nIn connection with the acquisition of Tempe Student Housing in December 2021, we entered into a sale and leaseback transaction whereby we sold Tempe Student Housing to an unaffiliated third party for $54.0 million and simultaneously entered into a lease agreement with the same unaffiliated third party to lease the property back over a 104 year lease term. The lease requires an initial annual lease payment of $1.4 million, subject to annual increases whereby the new lease payment will equal 102% of the prior year's lease payment plus periodic adjustments based on the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items.\nThe sale and leaseback of Tempe Student Housing is accounted for as a failed sale and leaseback because the lease is classified as a finance lease. Accordingly, the sale of Tempe Student Housing is not recognized and the property continues to be included within our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We will continue to depreciate the property as if we were the legal owner. The proceeds received from the sale, net of debt issuance costs of $0.4 million, are accounted for as a financing obligation on our consolidated balance sheets in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We allocate the rental payments under the lease between interest expense and principal repayment of the financing obligation using the effective interest method. The total principal payments will not exceed the difference between the gross proceeds from the sale of $54.0 million and the initial carrying value of the land of $17.6 million, resulting in maximum principal payments of $36.4 million over the term of the arrangement.\nSee Note 8 - Borrowings\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of our borrowing arrangements.\nOther potential future sources of capital include incremental secured or unsecured financings from banks or other lenders and proceeds from the sale of assets. If necessary, we may use financings or other sources of capital in the event of unforeseen significant capital expenditures. We have not yet identified any sources for these types of financings.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $13.8 million and restricted cash of $1.7 million. Our restricted cash primarily consists of an interest reserve that we are contractually required to maintain on deposit under the terms of our preferred membership interest in a limited liability company. Restricted cash also includes amounts in escrow for taxes and insurance related to mortgages at certain properties, as well as security deposits.\nWe hold a preferred membership interest in an unconsolidated limited liability company that owns the San Simeon Apartments and have committed to fund improvements to the San Simeon Apartments. We are required to fund these commitments as requested through December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2021, our undrawn capital commitment was $3.7 million.\nWe have committed to fund up to $3.5 million of tenant improvements at our Willows Facility through May 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2021, we have funded $3.1 million.\nWe believe that our current level of cash and borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility, together with expected future cash flows from our Offering, Private Offerings and future operations, will be sufficient to meet the needs of our existing operations and planned requirements for the foreseeable future.\nCash Flows\nThe following table provides a breakdown of the net change in our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash:\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$ in thousands </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Period October 28, 2019 (date of initial capitalization) through\nDecember 31, 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows provided by operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,604 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>560 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows used in investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(443,151) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(156,995) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows provided by financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>445,328 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>159,953 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>200 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,781 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,518 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>200 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities - Cash flows provided by operating activities increased $9.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the corresponding period in 2020 due to an increase in cash flows from operations from our investments in real estate as a result of growth in the size of our portfolio, positive leasing activity and income distributions from our equity investments in unconsolidated entities. Cash flows provided by operating activities increased $0.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the corresponding period in 2019 due to our net loss of $3.3 million adjusted for non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. We commenced operations in September 2020; accordingly, net cash provided by operating activities does not reflect a full year of operations.\nInvesting Activities - Cash flows used in investing activities increased $286.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the corresponding period in 2020 primarily due to an increase in our investments of $353.7 million in real estate, capital improvements to real estate and real-estate related securities, offset by a decrease in our investment in unconsolidated entities of $60.6 million. Cash flows used in investing activities increased $157.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the corresponding period in 2019 as we commenced real estate operations in September 2020.\nFinancing Activities - Cash flows provided by financing activities increased $285.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the corresponding period in 2020 primarily due to an increase in net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock of $206.4 million, and an increase in proceeds from borrowings of $285.3 million from the Revolving Credit Facility, mortgages payable and a financing obligation, offset primarily by increases in repayments under the Revolving Credit Facility of $127.7 million and repurchases of our common stock of $70.0 million. Cash flows provided by financing activities increased $159.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the corresponding period in 2019 as we commenced real estate operations in September 2020.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires the use of estimates and assumptions that involve the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties. Accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties. All of these estimates reflect our best judgment about current, and for some estimates, future economic and market conditions and their effects based on information available as of the date of these financial statements. If conditions change from those expected, it is possible that materially different amounts could be reported in our financial statements.\nPurchase Price Allocation of Acquired Real Estate\nUpon the acquisition of a property, we assess the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities (including land, buildings, tenant improvements, above-market and below-market leases, acquired in-place leases, other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities) and allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities on a relative fair value basis in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification 805, Business Combinations. All expenses related to the acquisition are capitalized and allocated among the identified assets. Generally, the most significant portion of the allocation is to building and land and requires the use of market-based estimates and assumptions.\nWe estimate value using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers (e.g., discounted cash flow analysis). Factors considered in our analysis include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods, considering current market rental rates and costs to execute similar leases. We also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired. In estimating carrying costs, management also includes real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on specific local cap rates and discount rates. We also estimate costs to execute similar leases, including leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses to the extent that such costs are not already incurred in connection with a new lease origination as part of the transaction. We also consider the nature and extent of our existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant's credit quality and management's expectations of lease renewals (including those existing under the terms of the lease agreement), among other factors. A change in any of the assumptions above, which are subjective, could have a material impact on our results of operations.\nThe allocation of the purchase price directly affects the following in our consolidated financial statements:\n\u2022the amount of purchase price allocated to the various tangible and intangible assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets;\n\u2022the amounts allocated to the value of above-market and below-market lease values are amortized to rental income over the remaining non-cancelable terms of the respective leases. The amounts allocated to all other tangible and intangible assets are amortized to depreciation or amortization expense. Thus, depending on the amounts allocated between land and other depreciable assets, changes in the purchase price allocation among our assets could have a material impact on our FFO, a metric which is used by many REIT investors to evaluate our operating performance; and\n\u2022the period of time over which tangible and intangible assets are depreciated varies greatly, and thus, changes in the amounts allocated to these assets will have a direct impact on our results of operations. Intangible assets are generally amortized over the respective life of the leases. Also, we depreciate our buildings over up to 40 years, but do not depreciate our land. These differences in timing could have a material impact on our results of operations.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nOur estimate of the expected future cash flows used in testing for impairment is subjective and based on, among other things, our estimates regarding future market conditions, rental rates, occupancy levels, costs of tenant improvements, assumptions regarding the residual value of our properties at the end of our anticipated holding period, discount rates, exit capitalization rates and the length of our anticipated holding period. In preparing the projection of undiscounted future cash flows, we estimate exit capitalization rates and market rental rates using information that we obtain from market comparability studies and other comparable sources, and apply the undiscounted cash flows against our expected holding period. These assumptions could differ materially from actual results. If changes in our strategy or the market conditions result in a reduction in the holding period and an earlier sale date, an impairment loss could be recognized and such loss could be material. If impairment were indicated, the carrying value of the property would be written down to its estimated fair value based on our best estimate of the property's discounted future cash flows using market derived capitalization rates, discount rates and market rental rates applied against our expected hold period.\nUsing the methodology discussed above, we evaluated our entire portfolio, as of December 31, 2021, for any impairment indicators and performed an impairment analysis on select properties that had an indication of impairment. No such strategy changes or market conditions have been identified as of December 31, 2021. We did not record any impairment losses for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nRedeemable Common Stock\nWe report our redeemable common stock on our consolidated balance sheets at MassMutual's redemption value. MassMutual's redemption value is determined based on our NAV per Class N share as of our balance sheet date. For purposes of determining our NAV, our investments in real estate are recorded at fair value based on third party valuations prepared by licensed appraisers in accordance with standard industry practice.\nThese fair value estimates of our investments in real estate are particularly important as they are used for the calculation of NAV, which determines the adjustment to the carrying value of our redeemable common stock. Significant differences in the fair value of our redeemable common stock may result from changes in market conditions that cause our NAV, and thus MassMutual's redemption value, to increase or decrease during the period. Although increases and decreases in our NAV do not have an impact to our consolidated statements of operations, they would cause a significant change in our equity.\nPending Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of pending accounting pronouncements.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical data, this discussion contains forward-looking statements about our business, operations and financial performance based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those in this discussion as a result of various factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Part I Item 1A - Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a Maryland corporation formed in October 2018. We invest primarily in stabilized, income-oriented commercial real estate in the United States. To a lesser extent, we also invest in real estate-related securities to provide a source of liquidity for our share repurchase plan, cash management and other purposes. We own, and expect to continue to own, all or substantially all of our assets through our Operating Partnership, of which we are the sole general partner.\nWe are externally managed and advised by our Adviser, a registered investment adviser and an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Invesco Ltd., a leading independent global investment management firm. Our Adviser utilizes the personnel and global resources of Invesco Real Estate to provide investment management services to us. We qualified to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2020. To maintain our REIT qualification, we are generally required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders annually. We operate our business in a manner that permits our exclusion from the definition of Investment Company\u201d under the Investment Company Act.\nOur board of directors will at all times have ultimate oversight and policy-making authority over us, including responsibility for governance, financial controls, compliance and disclosure. However, under our Advisory Agreement, we have delegated to the Adviser the authority to source, evaluate and monitor our investment opportunities and make decisions related to the acquisition, management, financing and disposition of our assets, in accordance with our investment objectives, guidelines, policies and limitations, subject to oversight by our board of directors.\nWe commenced real estate operations in September 2020.

We have registered a public offering of up to $3.0 billion in shares of common stock, consisting of up to $2.4 billion in shares in our Primary Offering and up to $600 million in shares under our distribution reinvestment plan. We are offering to sell any combination of five classes of shares of our common stock, Class T shares, Class S shares, Class D shares, Class I shares and Class E shares in the Offering, with a dollar value up to the maximum offering amount. The share classes have different upfront selling commissions and dealer manager fees and different ongoing stockholder servicing fees. The purchase price per share for each class of our common stock sold in the Offering will vary and will generally equal our prior month's NAV per share for such class, as determined monthly, plus any applicable upfront selling commissions and dealer manager fees.\nAs of March 28, 2022, we have received aggregate proceeds of approximately $62.1 million from the Offering. We intend to continue selling shares on a monthly basis.\nPrivate Offerings\nWe are conducting private offerings of up to $1.0 billion in shares of our Class N common stock ( Class N shares\u201d or Class N common stock\u201d) (the Class N Private Offering\u201d) and up to $20 million in shares of our Class E common stock (the Class E Private Offering\u201d) (collectively, the Private Offerings\u201d). As of March 28, 2022, we issued 14,168,780 shares of Class N common stock to affiliates of the Company in the Class N Private Offering for total net proceeds of $398.6 million after deducting offering costs of $1.1 million.

All of the Class N shares that were repurchased were classified as redeemable common stock on our consolidated balance sheets.\n2021 Highlights\nOperating Results\n\u2022Declared monthly net distributions totaling $11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The details of the average annualized distributions rates and total returns are shown in the following table:\n\n(1) The annualized distribution rate is calculated as the current month's distribution annualized and divided by the prior month's NAV, which is inclusive of all fees and expenses.\n(2) The inception date was June 1, 2021 for Class T, S and D shares; May 21, 2021 for Class I shares; May 14, 2021 for Class E shares and September 28, 2020 for Class N shares.\n(3) Total return is calculated as the change in NAV per share during the respective periods plus any distributions per share declared in the period and assumes any distributions are reinvested in accordance with our distribution reinvestment plan.\nCapital Activity and Financings\n\u2022Raised $229.5 million of proceeds from the sale of our common stock and repurchased $70.0 million of MassMutual's redeemable common stock during the year ended December 31, 2021.

There was no performance participation interest accrual for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, depreciation and amortization expenses were $10.5 million and approximately $37,000, respectively, driven by depreciation and amortization on our consolidated properties.\nInterest Expense\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we incurred interest expense of $3.0 million and $0.3 million, respectively, that primarily consists of interest expense on our mortgage notes and revolving credit facility. Interest expense also includes amortization of deferred financing costs related to obtaining our mortgage loans and revolving credit facility. See - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d below as well as Note 8 - Borrowings\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of our borrowing arrangements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWhile the long-term impact of COVID-19 to our business is not yet known, we believe that with respect to liquidity, we are well positioned with $162.4 million of immediate liquidity as of December 31, 2021, made up of $20.1 million of undrawn capacity on our revolving credit facility, $13.8 million of cash on hand, and $128.5 million of uncalled capital commitments. In addition, we hold $12.7 million in investments in real estate-related securities that could be liquidated to satisfy any potential liquidity requirements.\nOur primary needs for liquidity and capital resources are to fund our investments, to make distributions to our stockholders, to repurchase shares of our common stock under our share repurchase plan, to pay our offering costs and operating fees and expenses and to pay interest on our borrowings. We will obtain the funds required to purchase investments and conduct our operations from the net proceeds of our Private Offerings, our Primary Offering and any future offerings we may conduct, from secured and unsecured borrowings from banks and other lenders and from any undistributed funds from operations. Generally, cash needs for items other than asset acquisitions are met from operations, and cash needs for asset acquisitions are funded by our Private Offerings, the Offering and debt financings. However, there may be a delay between the sale of our shares and our purchase of assets that could result in a delay in the benefits to our stockholders, if any, of returns generated from our investment operations.\nOur target leverage ratio after we have raised substantial offering proceeds and acquired a broad portfolio of real estate investments is approximately 50% to 60%. We calculate our leverage ratio\u201d by dividing (1) the sum of our consolidated property-level debt, entity-level debt, and allocation of debt from investments in real estate funds managed by the Adviser or its affiliates in which we may invest, net of cash and restricted cash, by (2) the asset value of our real estate investments and equity in our real estate-related securities portfolio (in each case measured using the greater of fair market value and cost of gross real estate), including our investments in unconsolidated entities. Our leverage ratio calculation does not include (i) indebtedness incurred in connection with funding a deposit in advance of the closing of an investment, (ii) indebtedness incurred as other working capital advances, (iii) indebtedness on our real estate securities investments, or (iv) the pro rata share of debt within our unconsolidated investments. Our charter prohibits us from borrowing more than 300% of our net assets, which approximates borrowing 75% of the cost of our investments. We may exceed this limit if a majority of our independent directors approves each borrowing in excess of the limit and we disclose the justification for doing so to our stockholders.\nIf we are unable to raise substantial funds in the Offering or Private Offerings, we will make fewer investments resulting in less diversification in terms of the type, number and size of investments we make. Further, we have certain fixed operating expenses, including certain expenses as a publicly offered REIT, regardless of whether we are able to raise substantial funds in the Offering and Private Offerings. Our inability to raise substantial funds would increase our fixed operating expenses as a percentage of gross income, reducing our net income and limiting our ability to make distributions.\nOur offering and operating fees and expenses include, among other things, the management fee we pay to the Adviser, the performance participation interest that INREIT OP will pay to the Special Limited Partner, stockholder servicing fees we will pay to the Dealer Manager, legal, audit and valuation expenses, federal and state filing fees, printing expenses, administrative fees, transfer agent fees, marketing and distribution expenses and fees related to acquiring, financing, appraising and managing our properties. The Adviser and its affiliates provide us with our management team, including our officers and appropriate support personnel. The Adviser or the Adviser's affiliates may provide us services that would otherwise be performed by third parties. In such event, we will reimburse the Adviser or the Adviser's affiliate the cost of performing such services provided that such reimbursements will not exceed the amount that would be payable if such services were provided by a third party in an arms-length transaction.\nThe Adviser has agreed to advance all of our operating expenses on our behalf through the earlier of (1) the date that our NAV reaches $500 million and (2) December 31, 2021. These advanced expenses will be reimbursed to the Adviser pro rata over 60 months beginning January 1, 2022. We will reimburse the Adviser for any subsequent offering expenses as incurred. As of December 31, 2021, the Adviser has advanced $6.4 million of general and administrative expenses on our behalf.\nThe Adviser has agreed to advance all of our organization and offering expenses on our behalf (other than upfront selling commissions, dealer manager fees and ongoing stockholder servicing fees) through the earlier of (1) the date that our NAV reaches $1.0 billion and (2) December 31, 2022, at which time we will reimburse the Adviser for all of our advanced expenses ratably over 60 months. We will reimburse the Adviser for any subsequent organization and offering expenses as incurred. As of December 31, 2021, the Adviser had incurred offering expenses of $1.1 million and organization costs of $1.2 million on our behalf in connection with the Private Offerings, that are recorded as a component of due to affiliates on our consolidated balance sheets. The Adviser and its affiliates have also incurred organization and offering expenses of $3.4 million on our behalf in connection with the Offering that are recorded as a component of due to affiliates on our consolidated balance sheets.\nUnder our charter, we may reimburse the Adviser, at the end of each fiscal quarter, for total operating expenses paid by the Adviser. However, commencing with the quarter ended September 30, 2021, we may not reimburse the Adviser at the end of any fiscal quarter for total operating expenses (as defined in our charter) that, in the four consecutive fiscal quarters then ended, exceed the greater of 2% of average invested assets or 25% of net income determined without reduction for any additions to reserves for depreciation, bad debts or other similar non-cash reserves and excluding any gain from the sale of our assets for that period (the 2%/25% Guidelines\u201d).\nWe may reimburse the Adviser for expenses in excess of the 2%/25% Guidelines if a majority of our independent directors determines that such excess expenses (an Excess Amount\u201d) are justified based on unusual and non-recurring factors.\nFor the four fiscal quarters ended December 31, 2021, our total operating expenses of $7.1 million exceeded the 2%/25% Guidelines by $0.7 million. Our independent directors determined that the Excess Amount of total operating expenses for the four quarters ended December 31, 2021 was justified, and therefore will be reimbursed to the Adviser, because (1) the amounts reflect legitimate operating expenses necessary for the operation of our business, (2) we are currently in the initial acquisition stage of the business and our average invested assets grew by 65% between the first and second halves of 2021 as we closed on five investments in the three months ended December 31, 2021, (3) the expenses incurred as a result of being a public company (including expenses for audit and legal services, director and officer liability insurance and fees for directors) are significant and disproportionate to our average invested assets and net income and (4) we have experienced outsized performance during this period resulting in an increased performance participation interest. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our Total Operating Expenses were 2.2% and 89.5% of each of our Average Invested Assets and our Net Income, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our indebtedness includes a revolving credit facility, three mortgages secured by their corresponding properties and a financing obligation.\nOn September 23, 2020, INREIT OP entered into a revolving credit facility with Bank of America, N.A. ( Bank of America\u201d). During the year ended December 31, 2021, we entered into a new revolving credit facility ( Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) and repaid our previous revolving credit facility.\nThe following is a summary of the revolving credit facility:\n\n\n(1)Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to daily adjusted one-month LIBOR or a base rate, where the base rate is the highest of (1) federal funds rate plus 0.5%, (2) the rate of interest as publicly announced by Bank of America as its prime rate\u201d or (3) the one-month LIBOR rate plus 1.0%, in each case, plus an applicable margin that is based on our leverage ratio. The weighted-average interest rate for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, was 1.72% and 2.00%, respectively.\n(2)As of December 31, 2021, the borrowing capacity on the Revolving Credit Facility is $20.1 million. The borrowing capacity is less than the difference between the maximum facility size and the current principal outstanding balance as the calculation of borrowing capacity is limited by the aggregate fair value and cash flows of our unencumbered properties. On January 21, 2022, we entered into an amendment for our Revolving Credit Facility which increased our maximum facility size from $100 million to $150 million and converted the benchmark interest rate for all outstanding borrowings from daily adjusted one-month LIBOR to Term SOFR with a borrowing period of one month.\nThe following table summarizes certain characteristics of our mortgage notes that are secured by our properties:\n\n(1)The term L\u201d refers to the relevant floating benchmark rates, which include USD LIBOR and SOFR, as applicable to each loan. The mortgage agreements that utilize LIBOR contain LIBOR replacement language.\n(2)The mortgage note secured by the Cortona Apartments bears interest at the greater of (a) 2.65% or (b) the sum of (i) 2.40% plus (ii) one-month LIBOR. The weighted-average interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 2.65%.\n(3)The mortgage note secured by Bixby Kennesaw bears interest at the sum of (i) 1.60% plus (ii) one-month LIBOR. The weighted-average interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 1.69%.\n(4)The mortgage note secured by Tempe Student Housing bears interest at (i) 1.75% plus (ii) 30-Day SOFR Average as published on the website of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The weighted-average interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 1.80%.\nIn connection with the acquisition of Tempe Student Housing in December 2021, we entered into a sale and leaseback transaction whereby we sold Tempe Student Housing to an unaffiliated third party for $54.0 million and simultaneously entered into a lease agreement with the same unaffiliated third party to lease the property back over a 104 year lease term. The lease requires an initial annual lease payment of $1.4 million, subject to annual increases whereby the new lease payment will equal 102% of the prior year's lease payment plus periodic adjustments based on the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items.\nThe sale and leaseback of Tempe Student Housing is accounted for as a failed sale and leaseback because the lease is classified as a finance lease. Accordingly, the sale of Tempe Student Housing is not recognized and the property continues to be included within our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We will continue to depreciate the property as if we were the legal owner. The proceeds received from the sale, net of debt issuance costs of $0.4 million, are accounted for as a financing obligation on our consolidated balance sheets in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We allocate the rental payments under the lease between interest expense and principal repayment of the financing obligation using the effective interest method. The total principal payments will not exceed the difference between the gross proceeds from the sale of $54.0 million and the initial carrying value of the land of $17.6 million, resulting in maximum principal payments of $36.4 million over the term of the arrangement.\nSee Note 8 - Borrowings\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of our borrowing arrangements.\nOther potential future sources of capital include incremental secured or unsecured financings from banks or other lenders and proceeds from the sale of assets. If necessary, we may use financings or other sources of capital in the event of unforeseen significant capital expenditures. We have not yet identified any sources for these types of financings.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $13.8 million and restricted cash of $1.7 million. Our restricted cash primarily consists of an interest reserve that we are contractually required to maintain on deposit under the terms of our preferred membership interest in a limited liability company. Restricted cash also includes amounts in escrow for taxes and insurance related to mortgages at certain properties, as well as security deposits.\nWe hold a preferred membership interest in an unconsolidated limited liability company that owns the San Simeon Apartments and have committed to fund improvements to the San Simeon Apartments. We are required to fund these commitments as requested through December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2021, our undrawn capital commitment was $3.7 million.\nWe have committed to fund up to $3.5 million of tenant improvements at our Willows Facility through May 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2021, we have funded $3.1 million.\nWe believe that our current level of cash and borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility, together with expected future cash flows from our Offering, Private Offerings and future operations, will be sufficient to meet the needs of our existing operations and planned requirements for the foreseeable future.\nCash Flows\nThe following table provides a breakdown of the net change in our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash:\n\nOperating Activities - Cash flows provided by operating activities increased $9.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the corresponding period in 2020 due to an increase in cash flows from operations from our investments in real estate as a result of growth in the size of our portfolio, positive leasing activity and income distributions from our equity investments in unconsolidated entities. Cash flows provided by operating activities increased $0.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the corresponding period in 2019 due to our net loss of $3.3 million adjusted for non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. We commenced operations in September 2020; accordingly, net cash provided by operating activities does not reflect a full year of operations.\nInvesting Activities - Cash flows used in investing activities increased $286.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the corresponding period in 2020 primarily due to an increase in our investments of $353.7 million in real estate, capital improvements to real estate and real-estate related securities, offset by a decrease in our investment in unconsolidated entities of $60.6 million. Cash flows used in investing activities increased $157.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the corresponding period in 2019 as we commenced real estate operations in September 2020.\nFinancing Activities - Cash flows provided by financing activities increased $285.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the corresponding period in 2020 primarily due to an increase in net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock of $206.4 million, and an increase in proceeds from borrowings of $285.3 million from the Revolving Credit Facility, mortgages payable and a financing obligation, offset primarily by increases in repayments under the Revolving Credit Facility of $127.7 million and repurchases of our common stock of $70.0 million. Cash flows provided by financing activities increased $159.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the corresponding period in 2019 as we commenced real estate operations in September 2020.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires the use of estimates and assumptions that involve the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties. Accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties. All of these estimates reflect our best judgment about current, and for some estimates, future economic and market conditions and their effects based on information available as of the date of these financial statements. If conditions change from those expected, it is possible that materially different amounts could be reported in our financial statements.\nPurchase Price Allocation of Acquired Real Estate\nUpon the acquisition of a property, we assess the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities (including land, buildings, tenant improvements, above-market and below-market leases, acquired in-place leases, other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities) and allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities on a relative fair value basis in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification 805, Business Combinations. All expenses related to the acquisition are capitalized and allocated among the identified assets. Generally, the most significant portion of the allocation is to building and land and requires the use of market-based estimates and assumptions.\nWe estimate value using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers (e.g., discounted cash flow analysis). Factors considered in our analysis include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods, considering current market rental rates and costs to execute similar leases. We also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired. In estimating carrying costs, management also includes real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on specific local cap rates and discount rates. We also estimate costs to execute similar leases, including leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses to the extent that such costs are not already incurred in connection with a new lease origination as part of the transaction. We also consider the nature and extent of our existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant's credit quality and management's expectations of lease renewals (including those existing under the terms of the lease agreement), among other factors. A change in any of the assumptions above, which are subjective, could have a material impact on our results of operations.\nThe allocation of the purchase price directly affects the following in our consolidated financial statements:\n\u2022the amount of purchase price allocated to the various tangible and intangible assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets;\n\u2022the amounts allocated to the value of above-market and below-market lease values are amortized to rental income over the remaining non-cancelable terms of the respective leases. The amounts allocated to all other tangible and intangible assets are amortized to depreciation or amortization expense. Thus, depending on the amounts allocated between land and other depreciable assets, changes in the purchase price allocation among our assets could have a material impact on our FFO, a metric which is used by many REIT investors to evaluate our operating performance; and\n\u2022the period of time over which tangible and intangible assets are depreciated varies greatly, and thus, changes in the amounts allocated to these assets will have a direct impact on our results of operations. Intangible assets are generally amortized over the respective life of the leases. Also, we depreciate our buildings over up to 40 years, but do not depreciate our land. These differences in timing could have a material impact on our results of operations.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nOur estimate of the expected future cash flows used in testing for impairment is subjective and based on, among other things, our estimates regarding future market conditions, rental rates, occupancy levels, costs of tenant improvements, assumptions regarding the residual value of our properties at the end of our anticipated holding period, discount rates, exit capitalization rates and the length of our anticipated holding period. In preparing the projection of undiscounted future cash flows, we estimate exit capitalization rates and market rental rates using information that we obtain from market comparability studies and other comparable sources, and apply the undiscounted cash flows against our expected holding period. These assumptions could differ materially from actual results. If changes in our strategy or the market conditions result in a reduction in the holding period and an earlier sale date, an impairment loss could be recognized and such loss could be material. If impairment were indicated, the carrying value of the property would be written down to its estimated fair value based on our best estimate of the property's discounted future cash flows using market derived capitalization rates, discount rates and market rental rates applied against our expected hold period.\nUsing the methodology discussed above, we evaluated our entire portfolio, as of December 31, 2021, for any impairment indicators and performed an impairment analysis on select properties that had an indication of impairment. No such strategy changes or market conditions have been identified as of December 31, 2021. We did not record any impairment losses for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nRedeemable Common Stock\nWe report our redeemable common stock on our consolidated balance sheets at MassMutual's redemption value. MassMutual's redemption value is determined based on our NAV per Class N share as of our balance sheet date. For purposes of determining our NAV, our investments in real estate are recorded at fair value based on third party valuations prepared by licensed appraisers in accordance with standard industry practice.\nThese fair value estimates of our investments in real estate are particularly important as they are used for the calculation of NAV, which determines the adjustment to the carrying value of our redeemable common stock. Significant differences in the fair value of our redeemable common stock may result from changes in market conditions that cause our NAV, and thus MassMutual's redemption value, to increase or decrease during the period. Although increases and decreases in our NAV do not have an impact to our consolidated statements of operations, they would cause a significant change in our equity.\nPending Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of pending accounting pronouncements.", "item_7_tables": "Table 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Class T </td> <td> </td> <td>Class S </td> <td> </td> <td>Class D </td> <td> </td> <td>Class I </td> <td> </td> <td>Class E </td> <td> </td> <td>Class N </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average Annualized Distribution Rate (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>4.9% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.9% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.7% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.7% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.0% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year-to-Date Total Return, without upfront selling commissions (2)(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>13.1% </td> <td> </td> <td>13.1% </td> <td> </td> <td>13.4% </td> <td> </td> <td>14.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>16.3% </td> <td> </td> <td>20.6% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year-to-Date Total Return, assuming maximum upfront selling commissions (2)(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>9.1% </td> <td> </td> <td>9.1% </td> <td> </td> <td>11.7% </td> <td> </td> <td>14.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>16.3% </td> <td> </td> <td>20.6% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inception-to-Date Total Return, without upfront selling commissions (2)(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>13.1% </td> <td> </td> <td>13.1% </td> <td> </td> <td>13.4% </td> <td> </td> <td>14.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>16.3% </td> <td> </td> <td>31.1% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inception-to-Date Total Return, assuming maximum upfront selling commissions (2)(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>9.1% </td> <td> </td> <td>9.1% </td> <td> </td> <td>11.7% </td> <td> </td> <td>14.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>16.3% </td> <td> </td> <td>31.1% </td> </tr>\n</table>Table 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset Allocation </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real Estate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real Estate-Related Securities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and Cash Equivalents </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>Table 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>By Investment Type(1)\n</td> <td>Percentage </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Healthcare </td> <td>27 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Office </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial </td> <td>9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Self-Storage </td> <td>9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Multifamily </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Student Housing </td> <td>34 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real Estate Preferred Equity </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>Table 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>By Geography(1)\n</td> <td>Percentage </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>South </td> <td>39 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>West </td> <td>45 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>East </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Midwest </td> <td>16 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>Table 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment </td> <td> </td> <td>Number of\nProperties </td> <td> </td> <td>Sq.

corporation focused on commercial real estate investment in the United States, which commenced real estate operations in September 2020.\n\n**Key Highlights:**\n\n- The corporation primarily invests in commercial real estate and, to a lesser extent, real estate-related securities mainly for liquidity.\n- It's externally managed by an adviser, a subsidiary of Invesco Ltd., and seeks to benefit from Invesco Real Estate's resources.\n- The corporation intends to distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income to stockholders annually.\n- It went public in May 2021 with a common stock offering aiming to raise up to $3.0 billion and has private offerings of up to $1.0 billion in Class N common stock and $20 million in Class E common stock.\n- As of March 28, 2022, the corporation received $62.1 million from the public offering and had net proceeds of $398.6 million from Class N stock in private offerings.\n- The corporation owns or has invested in 38 properties, focusing on growth markets across the U.S.\n- In 2021, it declared monthly net distributions totaling $11.7 million with various classes having different total returns, ranging from 9.1% to 31.1%, depending on the class and if upfront selling commissions are considered.\n- Capital activities for 2021 included raising $229.5 million from common stock sales and repurchasing $70.0 million of redeemable common stock.\n- Investments in 2021 included acquiring eight real estate properties totaling $402.1 million, a 42.5% indirect interest in two medical office buildings, and a preferred equity investment in retail properties.\n- The investment portfolio as of December 31, 2021, was predominantly in real estate (96%) with a diversification across healthcare, office, industrial, self-storage, multifamily, and student housing, spread mainly in the South (39%) and West (45%).\n- The corporation has significant liquidity, including a new $100 million revolving credit facility, cash, and cash equivalents, with commitments of potential future capital from secured or unsecured financings and the sale of assets.\n- For operating expenses, the Adviser has advanced costs to the corporation with reimbursement planned once net asset value (NAV) reaches certain thresholds.\n- Debt includes mortgages on specific properties, with interest rates tied to LIBOR or SOFR, and financing obligations from a sale and leaseback transaction.\n- Cash flows showed an increase in operating cash flow by $9.0 million in 2021 versus 2020 due to growth in the investment portfolio. Investing activities grew due to investments in real estate, while financing activities increased due to net proceeds from stock issuance and borrowings.\n\n**Critical Accounting Policies:**\n\n- Purchase Price Allocation of Acquired Real Estate: Fair value assessment and allocation of acquired assets and liabilities.\n- Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: Estimating future cash flows considering market conditions and property values.\n- Redeemable Common Stock: Adjustment of the carrying value of redeemable common stock based on NAV changes.\n\n**Pending Accounting Pronouncements:**\nDetails on pending accounting standards and their future impact are outlined in Note 2 of the financial statements in the full report."}
