We are a closed-end, externally managed, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a Business Development Company under the Investment Company Act. In addition, we have qualified and elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code for tax purposes.\nAs of October 17, 2017, we are externally managed by Oaktree, a subsidiary of OCG, pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement. Oaktree Administrator provides certain administrative and other services necessary for us to operate pursuant to the Administration Agreement.\nWe seek to generate a stable source of current income while minimizing the risk of principal loss and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation by providing innovative first-lien financing solutions to companies across a wide variety of industries. We invest in companies across a variety of industries that typically possess business models we expect to be resilient in the future with underlying fundamentals that will provide strength in future downturns. We intend to deploy capital across credit and economic cycles with a focus on long-term results, which we believe will enable us to build lasting partnerships with financial sponsors and management teams. We invest in unsecured loans, including subordinated loans, issued by private middle-market companies and, to a lesser extent, senior and subordinated loans issued by public companies and equity investments. Prior to January 18, 2018, under normal market conditions, we were required to invest at least 80% of the value of our net assets plus borrowings for investment purposes in floating rate senior loans, which include both first and second lien secured debt financings.\nOaktree intends to reposition our portfolio in order to (1) rotate out of a small number of investments that it views as challenged, (2) focus on increasing the size of our core private investments and (3) supplement the portfolio with broadly syndicated and select privately\nplaced loans. Our Adviser is generally focused on middle-market companies, which we define as companies with enterprise values of between $100 million and $750 million. Going forward, we expect our portfolio to include primarily first lien floating rate senior secured financings. We expect to target investments of $10 million to $20 million, on average, although we may invest more or less in certain portfolio companies. We generally invest in securities that are rated below investment grade by rating agencies or that would be rated below investment grade if they were rated. Below investment grade securities, which are often referred to as high yield\u201d and junk,\u201d have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer's capacity to pay interest and repay principal.\nSince becoming our investment adviser, Oaktree has performed a comprehensive review of our portfolio and categorized our portfolio into core investments, non-core performing investments and non-accrual investments. Certain additional information on such categorization and our portfolio composition is included in investor presentations that we file with the SEC.\nSince becoming our investment adviser, Oaktree has reduced the investments it has identified as non-core by approximately $235 million, at fair value. Over time, Oaktree intends to rotate us out of the approximately $59 million of non-core investments at fair value that remain as of September 30, 2018. In addition, over time and under current market conditions, Oaktree generally expects to increase leverage to a debt to equity ratio of 1.20x to 1.60x following effectiveness of the 150% reduced asset coverage requirements to us on July 11, 2018.\nBusiness Environment and Developments\nWe believe that the shift of commercial banks away from lending to middle-market companies following the 2008 financial crisis, including as a result of the passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the adoption of the Basel III Accord continues to create opportunities for non-bank lenders such as us. We believe middle-market companies represent a significant opportunity for direct lending as there are nearly 200,000 middle-market businesses, representing one-third of private sector gross domestic product and accounting for approximately 48 million jobs according to the National Center for the Middle Market. In addition, according to the S&P Global Market Intelligence LCD Middle Market Review, during the first nine months of the 2018 calendar year, middle-market lending volume exceeded $20 billion for deal sizes of less than $350 million.\nWe believe that quantitative easing and other similar monetary policies implemented by central banks worldwide in reaction to the 2008 financial crisis have created significant inflows of capital, including from private equity sponsors, focused on yield-driven products such as sub-investment grade debt. While we believe that private equity sponsors continue to have a large pool of available capital and will continue to pursue acquisitions in the middle market, increased competition from other lenders to middle-market companies together with increased capital focused on the sector have led to spread compression across the middle market, resulting in spreads near historically low levels.\nWe believe that the fundamentals of middle-market companies remain strong. In this environment, we believe attractive risk-adjusted returns can be achieved by investing in companies that cannot efficiently access traditional debt capital markets. We believe that the Company has the resources and experience to source, diligence and structure investments in these companies and is well placed to generate attractive returns for investors.\nInvestment Advisory Agreement with Oaktree\nUpon the closing of the Transaction contemplated by the Purchase Agreement on October 17, 2017, Oaktree became the investment adviser to each of OCSL and us. The closing of the Transaction resulted in an assignment for purposes of the Investment Company Act of the Former Investment Advisory Agreement, and, as a result, its immediate termination. See Note 11. Related Party Transactions- Investment Advisory Agreement\u201d and - Administrative Services\u201d in the notes to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAsset Coverage Requirements\nOn March 23, 2018, the SBCAA was enacted into law. The SBCAA, among other things, amended Section 61(a) of the Investment Company Act to add a new Section 61(a)(2) that reduces the asset coverage requirements applicable to Business Development Companies from 200% to 150% so long as the Business Development Company meets certain disclosure requirements and obtains certain approvals. The reduced asset coverage requirements permit a Business Development Company to have a debt to equity ratio of a maximum of 2x (i.e. $2 of debt outstanding for each $1 of equity) as compared to a maximum of 1x (i.e. $1 of debt outstanding for each $1 of equity) under the 200% asset coverage requirement. Effectiveness of the reduced asset coverage requirements to a Business Development Company requires approval by either (1) a required majority,\u201d as defined in Section 57(o) of the Investment Company Act, of such Business Development Company's Board of Directors with effectiveness one year after the date of such approval or (2) a majority of votes cast at a special or annual meeting of such Business Development Company's stockholders at which a quorum is present, which is effective the day after such stockholder approval.\nAt a meeting held on May 3, 2018, our Board of Directors, including a required majority\u201d of the directors, as defined in Section 57(o) of the Investment Company Act, approved the application of the reduced asset coverage requirements in Section 61(a)(2) of the Investment Company Act as being in the best interests of us and our stockholders. At a special meeting of our stockholders held on July 10, 2018, our stockholders approved the application of the reduced asset coverage requirements in Section 61(a)(2) of the Investment Company Act to us effective as of July 11, 2018. The reduced asset coverage requirements permit us to double the maximum amount of\nleverage that we are permitted to incur by reducing the asset coverage requirements applicable to us from 200% to 150%. As of September 30, 2018, we had $275.1 million in senior securities outstanding and our asset coverage ratio was 207.5%.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-K and Regulation S-X. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. We are an investment company following the accounting and reporting guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 946, Financial Services-Investment Companies, or ASC 946.\nInvestment Valuation\nWe value our investments in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, or ASC 820, which defines fair value as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We report our investments for which current market values are not readily available at fair value. A liability's fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. ASC 820 prioritizes the use of observable market prices derived from such prices over entity-specific inputs. Where observable prices or inputs are not available or reliable, valuation techniques are applied. These valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the investments or market and the investments' complexity.\nHierarchical levels, defined by ASC 820 and directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuation of these assets and liabilities, are as follows:\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Level 1 - Unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the measurement date.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Level 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data at the measurement date for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that reflect management's best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> If inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, an investment's level is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the investment. This includes investment securities that are valued using \"bid\" and \"ask\" prices obtained from independent third party pricing services or directly from brokers. These investments may be classified as Level 3 because the quoted prices may be indicative in nature for securities that are in an inactive market, may be for similar securities or may require adjustments for investment-specific factors or restrictions.\nFinancial instruments with readily available quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment inherent in measuring fair value. As such, Oaktree obtains and analyzes readily available market quotations provided by pricing vendors and brokers for all of our investments for which quotations are available. In determining the fair value of a particular investment, pricing vendors and brokers use observable market information, including both binding and non-binding indicative quotations.\nWe seek to obtain at least two quotations for the subject or similar securities, typically from pricing vendors. If we are unable to obtain two quotes from pricing vendors, or if the prices obtained from pricing vendors are not within our set threshold, we seek to obtain a quote directly from a broker making a market for the asset. Oaktree evaluates the quotations provided by pricing vendors and brokers based on available market information, including trading activity of the subject or similar securities, or by performing a comparable security analysis to ensure that fair values are reasonably estimated. Oaktree also performs back-testing of valuation information obtained from pricing vendors and brokers against actual prices received in transactions. In addition to ongoing monitoring and back-testing, Oaktree performs due diligence procedures over pricing vendors to understand their methodology and controls to support their use in the valuation process. Generally, we do not adjust any of the prices received from these sources.\nIf the quotations obtained from pricing vendors or brokers are determined to not be reliable or are not readily available, we value such investments using any of three different valuation techniques. The first valuation technique is the transaction precedent technique, which utilizes recent or expected future transactions of the investment to determine fair value, to the extent applicable. The second valuation technique is an analysis of the enterprise value, or EV, of the portfolio company. EV means the entire value of the portfolio\ncompany to a market participant, including the sum of the values of debt and equity securities used to capitalize the enterprise at a point in time. The EV analysis is typically performed to determine (i) the value of equity investments, (ii) whether there is credit impairment for debt investments and (iii) the value for debt investments that we are deemed to control under the Investment Company Act. To estimate the EV of a portfolio company, Oaktree analyzes various factors, including the portfolio company's historical and projected financial results, macroeconomic impacts on the company, and competitive dynamics in the company's industry. Oaktree also utilizes some or all of the following information based on the individual circumstances of the portfolio company: (i) valuations of comparable public companies, (ii) recent sales of private and public comparable companies in similar industries or having similar business or earnings characteristics, (iii) purchase price multiples as a multiple of their earnings or cash flow, (iv) the portfolio company's ability to meet its forecasts and its business prospects, (v) a discounted cash flow analysis, (vi) estimated liquidation or collateral value of the portfolio company's assets and (vii) offers from third parties to buy the portfolio company. We may probability weight potential sale outcomes with respect to a portfolio company when uncertainty exists as of the valuation date. The third valuation technique is a market yield technique, which is typically performed for non-credit impaired debt investments. In the market yield technique, a current price is imputed for the investment based upon an assessment of the expected market yield for a similarly structured investment with a similar level of risk, and we consider the current contractual interest rate, the capital structure and other terms of the investment relative to risk of the company and the specific investment. A key determinant of risk, among other things, is the leverage through the investment relative to the EV of the portfolio company. As debt investments held by us are substantially illiquid with no active transaction market, we depend on primary market data, including newly funded transactions and industry specific market movements, as well as secondary market data with respect to high yield debt instruments and syndicated loans, as inputs in determining the appropriate market yield, as applicable.\nIn accordance with ASC 820-10, certain investments that qualify as investment companies in accordance with ASC 946 may be valued using net asset value as a practical expedient for fair value. Consistent with FASB guidance under ASC 820, these investments are excluded from the hierarchical levels.\nWe estimate the fair value of privately held warrants using a Black Scholes pricing model, which includes an analysis of various factors and subjective assumptions, including the current stock price (by using an EV analysis as described above), the expected period until exercise, expected volatility of the underlying stock price, expected dividends and the risk-free rate. Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates.\nOur Board of Directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter in connection with determining the fair value of our investments:\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by Oaktree's valuation team in conjunction with Oaktree's portfolio management team and investment professionals responsible for each portfolio investment;\n</td> </tr>\n</table> \u2022Preliminary valuations are then reviewed and discussed with management of Oaktree;\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Separately, independent valuation firms engaged by our Board of Directors prepare valuations of our investments, on a selected basis, for which market quotations are not readily available or are readily available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of the investment, and submit the reports to us and provide such reports to Oaktree and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Oaktree compares and contrasts its preliminary valuations to the valuations of the independent valuation firms and prepares a valuation report for the Audit Committee;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The Audit Committee reviews the preliminary valuations with Oaktree, and Oaktree responds and supplements the preliminary valuations to reflect any discussions between Oaktree and the Audit Committee;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The Audit Committee makes a recommendation to our full Board of Directors regarding the fair value of the investments in our portfolio; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our Board of Directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The fair value of our investments as of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017 was determined in good faith by our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors has and will continue to engage independent valuation firms to provide assistance regarding the determination of the fair value of a portion of our portfolio securities for which market quotations are not readily available or are readily available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of the investment each quarter, and the Board of Directors may reasonably rely on that assistance. As of September 30, 2018, 95.0% of our portfolio at fair value was valued either based on market quotations, the transactions precedent approach or corroborated by independent valuation firms. However, our Board of Directors is responsible for the ultimate valuation of the portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to our valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process.\nAs of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, approximately 95.2% and 92.1%, respectively, of our total assets represented investments at fair value.\nRevenue Recognition\nInterest and Dividend Income\nInterest income, adjusted for accretion of OID, is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected. We stop accruing interest on investments when it is determined that interest is no longer collectible. Investments that are expected to pay regularly scheduled interest in cash are generally placed on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest cash payments will be collected. Cash interest payments received on investments may be recognized as income or a return of capital depending upon management's judgment. A non-accrual investment is restored to accrual status if past due principal and interest are paid in cash, and the portfolio company, in management's judgment, is likely to continue timely payment of its remaining obligations. As of September 30, 2018, there was one investment on which we had stopped accruing cash and/or PIK interest or OID income.\nIn connection with our investment in a portfolio company, we sometimes receive nominal cost equity that is valued as part of the negotiation process with the portfolio company. When we receive nominal cost equity, we allocate our cost basis in the investment between debt securities and the nominal cost equity at the time of origination. Any resulting discount from recording the loan, or otherwise purchasing a security at a discount, is accreted into interest income over the life of the loan.\nWe generally recognize dividend income on the ex-dividend date. Distributions received from equity investments are evaluated to determine if the distribution should be recorded as dividend income or a return of capital. Generally, we will not record distributions from such equity investments as dividend income unless there are sufficient earnings at the portfolio company prior to the distribution. Distributions that are classified as a return of capital are recorded as a reduction in the cost basis of the investment.\nFee Income\nWe receive a variety of fees in the ordinary course of business, including servicing, advisory, amendment, structuring and prepayment fees, which are classified as fee income and recognized as they are earned.\nPIK Interest Income\nOur investments in debt securities may contain PIK interest provisions. PIK interest, which represents contractually deferred interest added to the loan balance that is generally due at the end of the loan term, is generally recorded on the accrual basis to the extent such amounts are expected to be collected. We generally cease accruing PIK interest if there is insufficient value to support the accrual or if we do not expect the portfolio company to be able to pay all principal and interest due. Our decision to cease accruing PIK interest involves subjective judgments and determinations based on available information about a particular portfolio company, including whether the portfolio company is current with respect to its payment of principal and interest on its loans and debt securities; financial statements and financial projections for the portfolio company; our assessment of the portfolio company's business development success; information obtained by us in connection with periodic formal update interviews with the portfolio company's management and, if appropriate, the private equity sponsor; and information about the general economic and market conditions in which the portfolio company operates. Based on this and other information, we determine whether to cease accruing PIK interest on a loan or debt security. Our determination to cease accruing PIK interest is generally made well before our full write-down of a loan or debt security. In addition, if it is subsequently determined that we will not be able to collect any previously accrued PIK interest, the fair value of the loans or debt securities would be reduced by the amount of such previously accrued, but uncollectible, PIK interest. The accrual of PIK interest on our debt investments increases the recorded cost bases of these investments in our Consolidated Financial Statements and, as a result, increases the cost bases of these investments for purposes of computing the capital gains incentive fee payable by us to Oaktree beginning in the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019. To maintain our status as a RIC, income from PIK interest may be required to be distributed to our stockholders even though we have not yet collected the cash and may never do so.\nPortfolio Composition\nOur investments principally consist of senior loans in private middle-market companies and investments in the OCSI Glick JV. As of September 30, 2018, our senior loans were typically secured by a first or second lien on the assets of the portfolio company and generally had terms of up to ten years (but an expected average life of between three and four years). We believe the environment for direct lending remains active, and, as a result, a number of our portfolio companies were able to refinance and repay their loans during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2018, we originated $435.9 million of investment commitments in 56 new and six existing portfolio companies and funded $443.9 million of investments.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2018, we received $445.3 million of proceeds from prepayments, exits, other paydowns and sales and exited 51 portfolio companies.\nA summary of the composition of our investment portfolio at cost and fair value as a percentage of total investments is shown in the following tables:\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td>

On April 21, 2015, the OCSI Glick JV began investing in senior secured loans of middle-market companies. We co-invest in these securities with GF Equity Funding through the OCSI Glick JV. The OCSI Glick JV is managed by a four person Board of Directors, two of whom are selected by us and two of whom are selected by GF Equity Funding. The OCSI Glick JV is capitalized as transactions are completed, and portfolio decisions and investment decisions in respect of the OCSI Glick JV must be approved by the OCSI Glick JV investment committee, consisting of one representative selected by us and one representative selected by GF Equity Funding (with approval from a representative of each required). The members provide capital to the OCSI Glick JV in exchange for LLC equity interests, and we and GF Debt Funding, an entity advised by affiliates of GF Equity Funding, provide capital to the OCSI Glick JV in exchange for subordinated notes, or the Subordinated Notes. As of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, we and GF Equity Funding owned 87.5% and 12.5%, respectively, of the outstanding LLC equity interests, and we and GF Debt Funding owned 87.5% and 12.5%, respectively, of the Subordinated Notes. The OCSI Glick JV is not an \"eligible portfolio company\" as defined in section 2(a)(46) of the Investment Company Act.\nThe OCSI Glick JV's portfolio consisted of middle-market and other corporate debt securities of 31 and 23 portfolio companies as of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, respectively. The portfolio companies in the OCSI Glick JV are in industries similar to those in which we may invest directly.\nThe OCSI Glick JV entered into the JV Deutsche Bank Facility, which had a reinvestment period end date and maturity date of October 7, 2018 and October 7, 2023, respectively, and permitted borrowings of up to $125.0 million as of September 30, 2018. Borrowings under the JV Deutsche Bank Facility are secured by all of the assets of the OCSI Glick JV and all of the equity interests in the OCSI Glick JV. During the year ended September 30, 2018, the JV Deutsche Bank Facility was amended to (i) decrease the maximum permissible borrowings from $200 million to $125 million, (ii) extend the reinvestment period end date and maturity date to October 7, 2018 and October 7, 2023, respectively, and (iii) decrease the interest rate from the 3-month LIBOR plus 2.5% per annum with no LIBOR floor to the 3-month LIBOR plus 2.3% per annum with no LIBOR floor. The JV Deutsche Bank Facility was further amended on October 4, 2018 to extend the reinvestment period end and maturity date to January 7, 2019 and January 5, 2024, respectively. Under the JV Deutsche Bank Facility, $94.3 million and $56.9 million of borrowings were outstanding as of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, respectively.\nAs of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, the OCSI Glick JV had total assets of $166.2 million and $126.7 million, respectively. Our investment in the OCSI Glick JV consisted of LLC equity interests and Subordinated Notes of $58.5 million and $57.6 million in the aggregate at fair value as of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, respectively. The Subordinated Notes are junior in right of payment to the repayment of temporary contributions made by us to fund investments of the OCSI Glick JV that are repaid when GF Equity Funding and GF Debt Funding make their capital contributions and fund their Subordinated Notes, respectively.\nAs of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, the OCSI Glick JV had total capital commitments of $100.0 million, $87.5 million of which was from us and the remaining $12.5 million from GF Equity Funding and GF Debt Funding. Approximately $84.0 million and $81.6 million in aggregate commitments was funded as of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, respectively, of which\n$73.5 million and $71.4 million, respectively, was from us. As of each of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, we had commitments to fund Subordinated Notes to the OCSI Glick JV of $78.8 million, of which $12.4 million and $14.5 million, respectively, was unfunded. As of each of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, we had commitments to fund LLC equity interests in the OCSI Glick JV of $8.7 million, of which $1.6 million was unfunded as of each such date.\nBelow is a summary of the OCSI Glick JV's portfolio, followed by a listing of the individual loans in the OCSI Glick JV's portfolio as of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017:\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 30, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior secured loans (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$160,746,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$115,964,537\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average current interest rate on senior secured loans (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.30%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.92%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of borrowers in the OCSI Glick JV\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Largest loan exposure to a single borrower (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$7,960,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$11,267,524\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total of five largest loan exposures to borrowers (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$36,442,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$42,833,696\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________\n(1) At principal amount.\n(2) Computed using the weighted average annual interest rate on accruing senior secured loans at fair value.\nOCSI Glick JV Portfolio as of September 30, 2018\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Portfolio Company\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Industry\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Investment Type\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Maturity Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Current Interest Rate (1)(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Cash Interest Rate (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Principal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair Value (3)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Air Newco LLC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> IT consulting & other services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>First Lien Term Loan B\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5/31/2024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LIBOR+4.75% cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.03\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,500,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,481,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,575,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AI Ladder (Luxembourg) Subco S.a.r.l (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Electrical components & equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>First Lien Term Loan B\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7/9/2025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LIBOR+4.5% cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.02\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,000,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,853,898\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,029,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> AL Midcoast Holdings LLC (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Oil & gas storage & transportation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>First Lien Term Loan B\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8/1/2025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LIBOR+5.5% cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.84\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,000,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,930,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,028,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Altice France S.A.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Integrated telecommunication services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> First Lien Term Loan B13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8/14/2026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LIBOR+4% cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.16\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,000,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,925,338\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,982,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Alvogen Pharma US Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Pharmaceuticals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>First Lien Term Loan B\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4/1/2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LIBOR+4.75% (1% floor) cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.99\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,875,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,875,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,942,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Ancile Solutions, Inc.

All interest rates are payable in cash, unless otherwise noted.\n(2) The interest rate on the principal balance outstanding for all floating rate loans is indexed to LIBOR and/or an alternate base rate (e.g., prime rate), which typically resets semi-annually, quarterly, or monthly at the borrower's option. The borrower may also elect to have multiple interest reset periods for each loan. For each of these loans, we have provided the applicable margin over LIBOR or the alternate base rate based on each respective credit agreement and the cash interest rate as of period end. All LIBOR shown above is in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. As of September 30, 2018, the reference rates for the OCSI Glick JV's variable rate loans were the 30-day LIBOR at 2.24%, 60-day LIBOR at 2.29%, the 90-day LIBOR at 2.39%, the 180-day LIBOR at 2.59% and the PRIME at 5.25%.\n(3) Represents the current determination of fair value as of September 30, 2018 utilizing a similar technique as us in accordance with ASC 820.

All interest rates are payable in cash, unless otherwise noted.\n(2) The interest rate on the principal balance outstanding for all floating rate loans is indexed to LIBOR and/or an alternate base rate (e.g., prime rate), which typically resets semi-annually, quarterly, or monthly at the borrower's option. The borrower may also elect to have multiple interest reset periods for each loan. For each of these loans, we have provided the applicable margin over LIBOR or the alternate base rate based on each respective credit agreement.\n(3) Represents the current determination of fair value as of September 30, 2017 utilizing a similar technique as us in accordance with ASC 820.

The LLC equity interests are dividend producing to the extent there is residual cash to be distributed on a quarterly basis. We did not earn any dividend income for the year ended September 30, 2018 with respect to our investment in the LLC equity interests of the OCSI Glick JV. We reversed $0.6 million of dividend income previously recorded in prior periods during the year ended September 30, 2017 with respect to our LLC equity interests following a determination that such amounts were no longer collectible.

The Subordinated Notes are valued based on the total assets less the liabilities senior to the Subordinated Notes of the OCSI Glick JV in an amount not exceeding par under the enterprise value technique.\nDuring the years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, we did not sell any debt investments to the OCSI Glick JV.\nDiscussion and Analysis of Results and Operations\nResults of Operations\nThe principal measure of our financial performance is the net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations, which includes net investment income, net realized gain (loss) and net unrealized appreciation (depreciation). Net investment income is the difference between our income from interest, dividends, fees, and other investment income and total expenses. Net realized gain (loss) is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of investment related assets and liabilities and their stated costs. Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) is the net change in the fair value of our investment related assets and liabilities which are carried at fair value during the reporting period, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation (depreciation) when gains or losses are realized.\nComparison of Years Ended September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017\nTotal Investment Income\nTotal investment income includes interest on our investments, fee income and dividend and other income.\nTotal investment income for the years ended September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017 was $47.7 million and $46.6 million, respectively. For the year ended September 30, 2018, this amount primarily consisted of $45.6 million of interest income from portfolio investments (which included $2.2 million of PIK interest) and $2.1 million of fee income. For the year ended September 30, 2017, this amount primarily consisted of $44.9 million of interest income from portfolio investments (which included $0.4 million of PIK interest) and $2.2 million of fee income. The increase of $1.1 million in our total investment income for the year ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the year ended September 30, 2017, was due primarily to a $2.0 million one-time acceleration of interest income in connection with the repayment of our investment in Allen Media LLC and a $0.6 million increase of dividend income, which was primarily attributable to a reversal of dividend income during the year ended September 30, 2017, partially offset by a lower yield on our debt investments.\nExpenses\nNet expenses (expenses net of fee waivers and insurance recoveries) for the year ended September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017 were $27.9 million and $24.2 million, respectively. The increase of $3.7 million in our net expenses for the year ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the year ended September 30, 2017, was primarily due to a $3.6 million increase in interest expense, which was attributable to a $2.0 million write-off of previously unamortized financing costs in connection with the redemption of our $309.0 million debt securitization, or the 2015 Debt Securitization, and increases in LIBOR, a $1.4 million increase in professional fees (net of insurance recoveries) and a $0.4 million increase in administrator expense, partially offset by a $1.0 million decrease in incentive fees on income (net of fee waivers), which was attributable to lower pre-incentive fee net investment income, and a $0.6 million decrease in general and administrative expenses.\nNet Investment Income\nAs a result of the $1.1 million increase in total investment income and the $3.7 million increase in net expenses, net investment income for the year ended September 30, 2018 decreased by approximately $2.7 million, as compared to the year ended September 30, 2017.\nRealized Gain (Loss)\nRealized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the sale or redemption of investments, secured borrowings and foreign currency and the cost basis without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, and includes investments written-off during the period, net of recoveries. Realized losses may also be recorded in connection with our determination that certain investments are considered worthless securities and/or meet the conditions for loss recognition per the applicable tax rules.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2018, we recorded an aggregate net realized loss of $27.7 million primarily in connection with the exit of our investments in Ameritox Ltd. and Metamorph US 3, LLC. During the year ended September 30, 2017, we recorded an aggregate net realized loss of $13.4 million primarily in connection with the exit of our investment in the Answers Corporation.\nSee Note 9. Realized Gains or Losses and Net Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation on Investments\u201d in the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details regarding realized gain (loss) on investments for the years ended September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017.\nNet Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation)\nNet unrealized appreciation or depreciation is the net change in the fair value of our investments, secured borrowings and foreign currency during the reporting period, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation when gains or losses are realized.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2018, we recorded net unrealized appreciation of $28.6 million. For the year ended September 30, 2018, this consisted of $29.0 million of net reclassifications to realized loss (resulting in unrealized appreciation), which was primarily related to the disposal of our investments in Ameritox Ltd. and Metamorph US 3, LLC, and $1.0 million of net unrealized appreciation on equity investments, offset by $1.4 million of net unrealized depreciation on debt investments.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2017, we recorded net unrealized depreciation of $17.8 million. This consisted of $14.1 million of net unrealized depreciation on debt investments and $12.9 million of net unrealized depreciation on equity investments, both of which were primarily related to the write-downs of three of our investments, offset by $9.2 million of net reclassifications to realized loss (resulting in unrealized appreciation), which was primarily in connection with our disposal of our investment in the Answers Corporation.\nComparison of Years Ended September 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016\nTotal Investment Income\nTotal investment income includes interest on our investments, fee income and other investment income.\nTotal investment income for the years ended September 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016 was $46.6 million and $53.4 million, respectively. For the year ended September 30, 2017, this amount primarily consisted of $44.9 million of interest income from portfolio investments (which included $0.4 million of PIK interest) and $2.2 million of fee income. For the year ended September 30, 2016, this amount primarily consisted of $47.6 million of interest income from portfolio investments (which included $0.2 million of PIK interest), $3.1 million of fee income and $2.7 million of dividend income. The decrease of $6.9 million in our total investment income for the year ended September 30, 2017, as compared to the year ended September 30, 2016, was primarily attributable to a lower weighted average annual yield on our debt investments and lower dividend income earned on our investment in OCSI Glick JV. The weighted average annual yield on our debt investments as of September 30, 2017, including the return on the Subordinated Notes, was approximately 7.52%, as compared to 8.58% as of September 30, 2016.\nExpenses\nNet expenses (expenses net of base management fee waivers and insurance recoveries) for the years ended September 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016 were $24.2 million and $28.1 million, respectively. The decrease of $3.9 million in our net expenses for the year ended September 30, 2017, as compared to the year ended September 30, 2016, was primarily due to a $2.9 million decrease in professional fees (net of insurance recoveries) incurred in connection with proxy-related matters, a $2.0 million decrease in incentive fees on income payable to our investment adviser, which was attributable to lower pre-incentive fee net investment income for the year-over-year period, partially offset by a $1.2 million increase in interest expense attributable to higher interest rates in the current year.\nNet Investment Income\nAs a result of the $6.9 million decrease in total investment income, offset by the $3.9 million decrease in net expenses, net investment income for the year ended September 30, 2017 reflected an approximate $2.9 million decrease, as compared to the year ended September 30, 2016.\nRealized Gain (Loss)\nRealized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the sale or redemption of portfolio investments and the cost basis of the investments without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, and includes investments written-off during the period, net of recoveries. Realized losses may also be recorded in connection with our determination that certain investments are considered worthless securities and/or meet the conditions for loss recognition per the applicable tax rules.\nRealized losses on investments and secured borrowings increased from $12.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2016 to $13.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2017. Realized losses for the year ended September 30, 2017 were primarily attributable to the sale of our investment in Answers Corporation. Realized losses for the year ended September 30, 2016 were primarily attributable to the restructuring of our investment in Ameritox Ltd. and the disposition of our investment in B&H Education Inc.\nSee Note 9. Realized Gains or Losses and Net Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation on Investments\u201d in the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details regarding realized gain (loss) on investments and secured borrowings for the years ended September 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016.\nNet Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation)\nNet unrealized appreciation or depreciation is the net change in the fair value of our investments and secured borrowings during the reporting period, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation when gains or losses are realized.\nNet unrealized depreciation on investments and secured borrowings increased from $17.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2016 to $17.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2017. Net unrealized depreciation for the year ended September 30, 2017 was primarily the result of significant write-downs on our investment portfolio, including a $13.6 million write-down on one of our investments. Net unrealized depreciation on investments and secured borrowings for the year ended September 30, 2016 was primarily the result of significant write-downs on our investment portfolio, including $11.9 million of aggregate write-downs on one of our investments and OCSI Glick JV.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have a number of alternatives available to fund our investment portfolio and our operations, including raising equity, increasing or refinancing debt and funding from operational cash flow. We generally expect to fund the growth of our investment portfolio through (i) equity offerings in public or private offerings, which offerings will depend on future market conditions, funding needs and other factors and (ii) additional debt capital (to the extent permissible under the Investment Company Act). In the future, we may also securitize a portion of our investments. To securitize investments, we would likely create a wholly-owned subsidiary and contribute a pool of loans to the subsidiary. We would then sell interests in the subsidiary on a non-recourse basis to purchasers and we would retain all or a portion of the equity in the subsidiary. We cannot assure you, however, that our efforts to grow our portfolio will be successful. For example, our common stock has generally traded at prices below net asset value for the past several years, and we are currently limited in our ability to raise additional equity at prices below the then-current net asset value per share. Additionally, to generate liquidity we may reduce investment size by syndicating a portion of any given transaction. We intend to continue to generate cash primarily from cash flows from operations, including interest earned and future borrowings. We intend to fund our future distribution obligations through operating cash flow or with funds obtained through future equity and debt offerings or credit facilities, as we deem appropriate.\nOur primary uses of funds are investments in our targeted asset classes and cash distributions to holders of our common stock. Following effectiveness of the 150% reduced asset coverage requirements to us on July 11, 2018, over time and under current market conditions, we generally expect to target a debt to equity ratio of 1.20x to 1.60x over the long-term (i.e., one dollar of equity for each $1.20 to $1.60 of debt outstanding).\nFor the year ended September 30, 2018, we experienced a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $25.2 million. During that period, $16.9 million of cash was used in operating activities, primarily consisting of cash used to fund $455.0 million of investments and net revolvers, a decrease in net payables from unsettled transactions of $44.7 million and the cash activities related to $19.8 million of net investment income, partially offset by $464.3 million of principal payments and proceeds from the sale of investments. During the same period, cash used in financing activities was $8.2 million, primarily consisting of $192.1 million of net borrowings under our credit facilities, $180.0 million of net repayments of notes payable under the 2015 Debt Securitization, $18.3 million of cash distributions paid to our stockholders and $1.8 million of deferred financing costs paid.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2017, we experienced a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of $15.8 million. During that period, $68.8 million of cash was provided by operating activities, primarily consisting of $276.9 million of principal payments and proceeds from the sale of investments and cash activities related to $22.4 million of net investment income, partially offset by cash used to fund $290.6 million of investments and net revolvers. During the same period, cash used in financing activities was $53.0 million, primarily consisting of $24.5 million of net repayments under our credit facilities, $23.2 million of cash distributions paid to our stockholders and $5.0 million of repayments of secured borrowings.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2016, we experienced a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $21.7 million. During that period, $40.9 million of cash was provided by operating activities, primarily consisting of $308.4 million of principal payments and proceeds from the sale of investments and cash activities related to $25.3 million of net investment income, partially offset by cash used to fund $286.1 million of investments and net revolvers. During the same period, cash used by financing activities was $62.6 million, primarily consisting of $29.2 million of net repayments under our credit facilities, $6.4 million of net repayments under the 2015 Debt Securitization and $25.9 million of cash distributions paid to our shareholders.\nAs of September 30, 2018, we had $16.4 million of cash and cash equivalents (including $6.0 million of restricted cash), portfolio investments (at fair value) of $556.8 million, $3.1 million of interest, dividends and fees receivable, $3.8 million of net payables from unsettled transactions, $275.1 million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facilities and unfunded commitments of $22.8 million. Pursuant to the terms of the Citibank Facility, we are restricted in terms of access to $3.4 million of cash until the occurrence of the periodic distribution dates and, in connection therewith, our submission of our required periodic reporting schedules and verifications of our compliance with the terms of the credit agreement. As of September 30, 2018, $1.8 million of cash was restricted due to the obligation to pay interest under the terms of the Deutsche Bank Facility. As of September 30, 2018, $0.8 million was restricted due to minimum balance requirements under the East West Bank Facility.\nAs of September 30, 2017, we had $43.0 million of cash and cash equivalents (including $7.4 million of restricted cash), portfolio investments (at fair value) of $560.4 million, $3.0 million of interest, dividends and fees receivable, $48.5 million of net payables from unsettled transactions, $83.0 million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facilities, $177.8 million of borrowings outstanding under our 2015 Debt Securitization (net of unamortized financing costs) and unfunded commitments of $43.5 million. Pursuant to the terms of the Citibank Facility, we were restricted in terms of access to $2.0 million until the occurrence of the periodic distribution dates and, in connection therewith, our submission of our required periodic reporting schedules and verifications of our compliance with the terms of the credit agreement. As of September 30, 2017, $5.4 million of cash held in connection with the 2015 Debt Securitization was restricted due to the obligation to pay interest on the notes under the terms of the 2015 Debt Securitization.\nSignificant Capital Transactions\nThe following table reflects the distributions per share that we have paid, including shares issued under our dividend reinvestment plan, or DRIP, on our common stock since October 1, 2016:\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Frequency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Date Declared\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Record Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payment Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\nper Share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Cash Distribution\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>DRIP Shares Issued (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>DRIP Shares Value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Monthly\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 4, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>October 14, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>October 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,183,023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Monthly\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 4, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>November 15, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>November 30, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,183,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,986\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,908\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Monthly\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>October 19, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 15, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 30, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,179,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,586\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Monthly\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>October 19, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,180,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,905\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Monthly\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>October 19, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 15, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 28, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,183,581\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,969\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Monthly\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 6, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 15, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,165,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quarterly\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 6, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 15, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,543,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,840\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quarterly\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 7, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 15, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 29, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,536,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quarterly\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 7, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 15, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 29, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,439,519\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,809\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>159,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quarterly\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 5, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 15, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,091,583\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quarterly\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 3, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 15, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 29, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.145\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,232,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,829\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40,134\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quarterly\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 1, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 15, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 28, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,518,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,620\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________\n(1) Shares were purchased on the open market and distributed.\nIndebtedness\nSee Note 6. Borrowings\u201d in the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details regarding our indebtedness and secured borrowings.\nCitibank Facility\nAs of September 30, 2018 and 2017, we were able to borrow $180 million and $125 million, respectively, under the Citibank Facility.

Following such redemption, the agreements governing the 2015 Debt Securitization were terminated and FS Senior Funding Ltd. was merged with and into OCSI Senior Funding Ltd. with OCSI Senior Funding Ltd. continuing as the surviving entity. The senior secured notes would have otherwise matured on May 28, 2025. We expensed $2.0 million of previously unamortized financing costs in connection with the redemption of the 2015 Debt Securitization.\nPrior to September 24, 2018, the 2015 Debt Securitization consisted of $126.0 million Class A-T Senior Secured 2015 Notes which bore interest at three-month LIBOR plus 1.80%; $29.0 million Class A-S Senior Secured 2015 Notes which bore interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 1.55%, until a step-up in spread to 2.10% occurred in October 2016; $20.0 million Class A-R Senior Secured Revolving 2015 Notes which bore interest at a rate of commercial paper, or CP, plus 1.80%, or, collectively, the Class A 2015 Notes; and $25.0 million Class B Senior Secured 2015 Notes which bore interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 2.65% per annum, which were issued in a private placement.

Notes.\nFor the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the components of interest expense, cash paid for interest, average interest rates and average outstanding balances for the 2015 Debt

as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code for tax purposes. As long as we continue to qualify as a RIC, we will not be subject to tax on our investment company taxable income (determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid) or realized net capital gains, to the extent that such taxable income or gains is distributed, or deemed to be distributed as dividends, to stockholders on a timely basis.\nTaxable income generally differs from net income for financial reporting purposes due to temporary and permanent differences in the recognition of income and expenses, and generally excludes net unrealized appreciation or depreciation. Distributions declared and paid by us in a taxable year may differ from taxable income for that taxable year as such distributions may include the distribution of taxable\nincome derived from the current taxable year or the distribution of taxable income derived from the prior taxable year carried forward into and distributed in the current taxable year. Distributions also may include returns of capital.\nTo maintain RIC tax treatment, we must, among other things, distribute dividends, with respect to each taxable year, of an amount at least equal to 90% of our investment company taxable income (i.e., our net ordinary income and our realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any) determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid. As a RIC, we are also subject to a federal excise tax, based on distribution requirements of our taxable income on a calendar year basis. We anticipate timely distribution of our taxable income in accordance with tax rules. We did not incur a U.S. federal excise tax for calendar years 2016 and 2017 and do not expect to incur a U.S. federal excise tax for the calendar year 2018. We may incur a federal excise tax in future years.\nWe intend to distribute at least 90% of our annual taxable income (which includes our taxable interest and fee income) to our stockholders. The covenants under the respective documents governing the Citibank Facility, the East West Bank Facility and the Deutsche Bank Facility could, under certain circumstances, hinder our ability to satisfy the distribution requirement associated with our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC. In addition, we may retain for investment some or all of our net capital gains (i.e., realized net long-term capital gains in excess of realized net short-term capital losses) and treat such amounts as deemed distributions to our stockholders. If we do this, our stockholders will be treated as if they received actual distributions of the capital gains we retained and then reinvested the net after-tax proceeds in our common stock. Our stockholders also may be eligible to claim tax credits (or, in certain circumstances, tax refunds) equal to their allocable share of the tax we paid on the capital gains deemed distributed to them. To the extent our taxable earnings for a fiscal and taxable year fall below the total amount of our distributions for that fiscal and taxable year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our stockholders.\nWe may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time. In addition, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions due to the asset coverage test for borrowings applicable to us as a Business Development Company under the Investment Company Act and due to provisions in our credit facilities and debt instruments. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our taxable income annually, we will suffer adverse tax consequences, including possible loss of our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions or distributions at a particular level.\nA RIC may treat a distribution of its own stock as fulfilling its RIC distribution requirements if each stockholder elects to receive his or her entire distribution in either cash or stock of the RIC, subject to certain limitations regarding the aggregate amount of cash to be distributed to all stockholders. If these and certain other requirements are met, for U.S federal income tax purposes, the amount of the dividend paid in stock will be equal to the amount of cash that could have been received instead of stock. We have no current intention of paying dividends in shares of our stock in accordance with these guidelines.\nWe may generate qualified net interest income or qualified net short-term capital gains that may be exempt from U.S. withholding tax when distributed to foreign stockholders. A RIC is permitted to designate distributions of qualified net interest income and qualified short-term capital gains as exempt from U.S. withholding tax when paid to non-U.S. shareholders with proper documentation. The following table, which may be subject to change as we finalize our annual tax filings, lists the percentage of qualified net interest income and qualified short-term capital gains for the year ended September 30, 2018, our last tax year end. Table 154: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Qualified Net Interest Income\n</td> <td>Qualified Short-Term Capital Gains\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have adopted a DRIP that provides for the reinvestment of any distributions that we declare in cash on behalf of our stockholders, unless a stockholder elects to receive cash. As a result, if our Board of Directors declares a cash distribution, then our stockholders who have not opted out\u201d of the DRIP will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, rather than receiving a cash distribution. If our shares are trading at a premium to net asset value, we typically issue new shares to implement the DRIP, with such shares issued at the greater of the most recently computed net asset value per share of our common stock or 95% of the current market value per share of our common stock on the payment date for such distribution. If our shares are trading at a discount to net asset value, we typically purchase shares in the open market in connection with our obligations under the DRIP.\nRelated Party Transactions\nWe have entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with Oaktree and the Administration Agreement with Oaktree Administrator, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Oaktree. Mr. John B. Frank, an interested member of our Board of Directors, has an indirect pecuniary interest in Oaktree. Oaktree is a registered investment adviser under the Advisers Act that is partially and indirectly owned by OCG. See Note 11. Related Party Transactions - Investment Advisory Agreement\u201d and - Administrative Services\u201d in the notes to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPrior to October 17, 2017, we were externally managed and advised by our Former Adviser, and our administrator was FSC CT LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of our Former Adviser. Messrs. Bernard D. Berman, Patrick J. Dalton, Ivelin M. Dimitrov, Alexander C.\nFrank and Todd G. Owens, each an interested member of our Board of Directors for all or a portion of our fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 and prior to October 17, 2017, had a direct or indirect pecuniary interest in our Former Adviser.\nWe served as collateral manager to FS Senior Funding Ltd. under a collateral management agreement in connection with the 2015 Debt Securitization and were entitled to receive a fee for providing these services. We retained a sub-collateral manager, which was Oaktree from October 17, 2017 to September 24, 2018, to provide collateral management sub-advisory services to us pursuant to a sub-collateral management agreement. The sub-collateral manager was entitled to receive 100% of the collateral management fees paid to us under the collateral management agreement, but Oaktree irrevocably waived its right to such sub-collateral management fees in respect of the 2015 Debt Securitization.\nRecent Developments\nDistribution Declaration\nOn November 19, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly distribution of $0.155 per share, payable on December 28, 2018 to stockholders of record on December 17, 2018.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nSee Note 2.

We are a closed-end, externally managed, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a Business Development Company under the Investment Company Act. In addition, we have qualified and elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code for tax purposes.\nAs of October 17, 2017, we are externally managed by Oaktree, a subsidiary of OCG, pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement. Oaktree Administrator provides certain administrative and other services necessary for us to operate pursuant to the Administration Agreement.\nWe seek to generate a stable source of current income while minimizing the risk of principal loss and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation by providing innovative first-lien financing solutions to companies across a wide variety of industries. We invest in companies across a variety of industries that typically possess business models we expect to be resilient in the future with underlying fundamentals that will provide strength in future downturns. We intend to deploy capital across credit and economic cycles with a focus on long-term results, which we believe will enable us to build lasting partnerships with financial sponsors and management teams. We invest in unsecured loans, including subordinated loans, issued by private middle-market companies and, to a lesser extent, senior and subordinated loans issued by public companies and equity investments. Prior to January 18, 2018, under normal market conditions, we were required to invest at least 80% of the value of our net assets plus borrowings for investment purposes in floating rate senior loans, which include both first and second lien secured debt financings.\nOaktree intends to reposition our portfolio in order to (1) rotate out of a small number of investments that it views as challenged, (2) focus on increasing the size of our core private investments and (3) supplement the portfolio with broadly syndicated and select privately\nplaced loans. Our Adviser is generally focused on middle-market companies, which we define as companies with enterprise values of between $100 million and $750 million. Going forward, we expect our portfolio to include primarily first lien floating rate senior secured financings. We expect to target investments of $10 million to $20 million, on average, although we may invest more or less in certain portfolio companies. We generally invest in securities that are rated below investment grade by rating agencies or that would be rated below investment grade if they were rated. Below investment grade securities, which are often referred to as high yield\u201d and junk,\u201d have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer's capacity to pay interest and repay principal.\nSince becoming our investment adviser, Oaktree has performed a comprehensive review of our portfolio and categorized our portfolio into core investments, non-core performing investments and non-accrual investments. Certain additional information on such categorization and our portfolio composition is included in investor presentations that we file with the SEC.\nSince becoming our investment adviser, Oaktree has reduced the investments it has identified as non-core by approximately $235 million, at fair value. Over time, Oaktree intends to rotate us out of the approximately $59 million of non-core investments at fair value that remain as of September 30, 2018. In addition, over time and under current market conditions, Oaktree generally expects to increase leverage to a debt to equity ratio of 1.20x to 1.60x following effectiveness of the 150% reduced asset coverage requirements to us on July 11, 2018.\nBusiness Environment and Developments\nWe believe that the shift of commercial banks away from lending to middle-market companies following the 2008 financial crisis, including as a result of the passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the adoption of the Basel III Accord continues to create opportunities for non-bank lenders such as us. We believe middle-market companies represent a significant opportunity for direct lending as there are nearly 200,000 middle-market businesses, representing one-third of private sector gross domestic product and accounting for approximately 48 million jobs according to the National Center for the Middle Market. In addition, according to the S&P Global Market Intelligence LCD Middle Market Review, during the first nine months of the 2018 calendar year, middle-market lending volume exceeded $20 billion for deal sizes of less than $350 million.\nWe believe that quantitative easing and other similar monetary policies implemented by central banks worldwide in reaction to the 2008 financial crisis have created significant inflows of capital, including from private equity sponsors, focused on yield-driven products such as sub-investment grade debt. While we believe that private equity sponsors continue to have a large pool of available capital and will continue to pursue acquisitions in the middle market, increased competition from other lenders to middle-market companies together with increased capital focused on the sector have led to spread compression across the middle market, resulting in spreads near historically low levels.\nWe believe that the fundamentals of middle-market companies remain strong. In this environment, we believe attractive risk-adjusted returns can be achieved by investing in companies that cannot efficiently access traditional debt capital markets. We believe that the Company has the resources and experience to source, diligence and structure investments in these companies and is well placed to generate attractive returns for investors.\nInvestment Advisory Agreement with Oaktree\nUpon the closing of the Transaction contemplated by the Purchase Agreement on October 17, 2017, Oaktree became the investment adviser to each of OCSL and us. The closing of the Transaction resulted in an assignment for purposes of the Investment Company Act of the Former Investment Advisory Agreement, and, as a result, its immediate termination. See Note 11. Related Party Transactions- Investment Advisory Agreement\u201d and - Administrative Services\u201d in the notes to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAsset Coverage Requirements\nOn March 23, 2018, the SBCAA was enacted into law. The SBCAA, among other things, amended Section 61(a) of the Investment Company Act to add a new Section 61(a)(2) that reduces the asset coverage requirements applicable to Business Development Companies from 200% to 150% so long as the Business Development Company meets certain disclosure requirements and obtains certain approvals. The reduced asset coverage requirements permit a Business Development Company to have a debt to equity ratio of a maximum of 2x (i.e. $2 of debt outstanding for each $1 of equity) as compared to a maximum of 1x (i.e. $1 of debt outstanding for each $1 of equity) under the 200% asset coverage requirement. Effectiveness of the reduced asset coverage requirements to a Business Development Company requires approval by either (1) a required majority,\u201d as defined in Section 57(o) of the Investment Company Act, of such Business Development Company's Board of Directors with effectiveness one year after the date of such approval or (2) a majority of votes cast at a special or annual meeting of such Business Development Company's stockholders at which a quorum is present, which is effective the day after such stockholder approval.\nAt a meeting held on May 3, 2018, our Board of Directors, including a required majority\u201d of the directors, as defined in Section 57(o) of the Investment Company Act, approved the application of the reduced asset coverage requirements in Section 61(a)(2) of the Investment Company Act as being in the best interests of us and our stockholders. At a special meeting of our stockholders held on July 10, 2018, our stockholders approved the application of the reduced asset coverage requirements in Section 61(a)(2) of the Investment Company Act to us effective as of July 11, 2018. The reduced asset coverage requirements permit us to double the maximum amount of\nleverage that we are permitted to incur by reducing the asset coverage requirements applicable to us from 200% to 150%. As of September 30, 2018, we had $275.1 million in senior securities outstanding and our asset coverage ratio was 207.5%.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-K and Regulation S-X. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. We are an investment company following the accounting and reporting guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 946, Financial Services-Investment Companies, or ASC 946.\nInvestment Valuation\nWe value our investments in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, or ASC 820, which defines fair value as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We report our investments for which current market values are not readily available at fair value. A liability's fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. ASC 820 prioritizes the use of observable market prices derived from such prices over entity-specific inputs. Where observable prices or inputs are not available or reliable, valuation techniques are applied. These valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the investments or market and the investments' complexity.\nHierarchical levels, defined by ASC 820 and directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuation of these assets and liabilities, are as follows:\n \u2022 Level 1 - Unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the measurement date. \n \u2022 Level 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data at the measurement date for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. \n \u2022 Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that reflect management's best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model.  If inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, an investment's level is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the investment. This includes investment securities that are valued using \"bid\" and \"ask\" prices obtained from independent third party pricing services or directly from brokers. These investments may be classified as Level 3 because the quoted prices may be indicative in nature for securities that are in an inactive market, may be for similar securities or may require adjustments for investment-specific factors or restrictions.\nFinancial instruments with readily available quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment inherent in measuring fair value. As such, Oaktree obtains and analyzes readily available market quotations provided by pricing vendors and brokers for all of our investments for which quotations are available. In determining the fair value of a particular investment, pricing vendors and brokers use observable market information, including both binding and non-binding indicative quotations.\nWe seek to obtain at least two quotations for the subject or similar securities, typically from pricing vendors. If we are unable to obtain two quotes from pricing vendors, or if the prices obtained from pricing vendors are not within our set threshold, we seek to obtain a quote directly from a broker making a market for the asset. Oaktree evaluates the quotations provided by pricing vendors and brokers based on available market information, including trading activity of the subject or similar securities, or by performing a comparable security analysis to ensure that fair values are reasonably estimated. Oaktree also performs back-testing of valuation information obtained from pricing vendors and brokers against actual prices received in transactions. In addition to ongoing monitoring and back-testing, Oaktree performs due diligence procedures over pricing vendors to understand their methodology and controls to support their use in the valuation process. Generally, we do not adjust any of the prices received from these sources.\nIf the quotations obtained from pricing vendors or brokers are determined to not be reliable or are not readily available, we value such investments using any of three different valuation techniques. The first valuation technique is the transaction precedent technique, which utilizes recent or expected future transactions of the investment to determine fair value, to the extent applicable. The second valuation technique is an analysis of the enterprise value, or EV, of the portfolio company. EV means the entire value of the portfolio\ncompany to a market participant, including the sum of the values of debt and equity securities used to capitalize the enterprise at a point in time. The EV analysis is typically performed to determine (i) the value of equity investments, (ii) whether there is credit impairment for debt investments and (iii) the value for debt investments that we are deemed to control under the Investment Company Act. To estimate the EV of a portfolio company, Oaktree analyzes various factors, including the portfolio company's historical and projected financial results, macroeconomic impacts on the company, and competitive dynamics in the company's industry. Oaktree also utilizes some or all of the following information based on the individual circumstances of the portfolio company: (i) valuations of comparable public companies, (ii) recent sales of private and public comparable companies in similar industries or having similar business or earnings characteristics, (iii) purchase price multiples as a multiple of their earnings or cash flow, (iv) the portfolio company's ability to meet its forecasts and its business prospects, (v) a discounted cash flow analysis, (vi) estimated liquidation or collateral value of the portfolio company's assets and (vii) offers from third parties to buy the portfolio company. We may probability weight potential sale outcomes with respect to a portfolio company when uncertainty exists as of the valuation date. The third valuation technique is a market yield technique, which is typically performed for non-credit impaired debt investments. In the market yield technique, a current price is imputed for the investment based upon an assessment of the expected market yield for a similarly structured investment with a similar level of risk, and we consider the current contractual interest rate, the capital structure and other terms of the investment relative to risk of the company and the specific investment. A key determinant of risk, among other things, is the leverage through the investment relative to the EV of the portfolio company. As debt investments held by us are substantially illiquid with no active transaction market, we depend on primary market data, including newly funded transactions and industry specific market movements, as well as secondary market data with respect to high yield debt instruments and syndicated loans, as inputs in determining the appropriate market yield, as applicable.\nIn accordance with ASC 820-10, certain investments that qualify as investment companies in accordance with ASC 946 may be valued using net asset value as a practical expedient for fair value. Consistent with FASB guidance under ASC 820, these investments are excluded from the hierarchical levels.\nWe estimate the fair value of privately held warrants using a Black Scholes pricing model, which includes an analysis of various factors and subjective assumptions, including the current stock price (by using an EV analysis as described above), the expected period until exercise, expected volatility of the underlying stock price, expected dividends and the risk-free rate. Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates.\nOur Board of Directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter in connection with determining the fair value of our investments:\n \u2022 The quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by Oaktree's valuation team in conjunction with Oaktree's portfolio management team and investment professionals responsible for each portfolio investment;  \u2022Preliminary valuations are then reviewed and discussed with management of Oaktree;\n \u2022 Separately, independent valuation firms engaged by our Board of Directors prepare valuations of our investments, on a selected basis, for which market quotations are not readily available or are readily available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of the investment, and submit the reports to us and provide such reports to Oaktree and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors; \n \u2022 Oaktree compares and contrasts its preliminary valuations to the valuations of the independent valuation firms and prepares a valuation report for the Audit Committee; \n \u2022 The Audit Committee reviews the preliminary valuations with Oaktree, and Oaktree responds and supplements the preliminary valuations to reflect any discussions between Oaktree and the Audit Committee; \n \u2022 The Audit Committee makes a recommendation to our full Board of Directors regarding the fair value of the investments in our portfolio; and \n \u2022 Our Board of Directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio.  The fair value of our investments as of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017 was determined in good faith by our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors has and will continue to engage independent valuation firms to provide assistance regarding the determination of the fair value of a portion of our portfolio securities for which market quotations are not readily available or are readily available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of the investment each quarter, and the Board of Directors may reasonably rely on that assistance. As of September 30, 2018, 95.0% of our portfolio at fair value was valued either based on market quotations, the transactions precedent approach or corroborated by independent valuation firms. However, our Board of Directors is responsible for the ultimate valuation of the portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to our valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process.\nAs of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, approximately 95.2% and 92.1%, respectively, of our total assets represented investments at fair value.\nRevenue Recognition\nInterest and Dividend Income\nInterest income, adjusted for accretion of OID, is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected. We stop accruing interest on investments when it is determined that interest is no longer collectible. Investments that are expected to pay regularly scheduled interest in cash are generally placed on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest cash payments will be collected. Cash interest payments received on investments may be recognized as income or a return of capital depending upon management's judgment. A non-accrual investment is restored to accrual status if past due principal and interest are paid in cash, and the portfolio company, in management's judgment, is likely to continue timely payment of its remaining obligations. As of September 30, 2018, there was one investment on which we had stopped accruing cash and/or PIK interest or OID income.\nIn connection with our investment in a portfolio company, we sometimes receive nominal cost equity that is valued as part of the negotiation process with the portfolio company. When we receive nominal cost equity, we allocate our cost basis in the investment between debt securities and the nominal cost equity at the time of origination. Any resulting discount from recording the loan, or otherwise purchasing a security at a discount, is accreted into interest income over the life of the loan.\nWe generally recognize dividend income on the ex-dividend date. Distributions received from equity investments are evaluated to determine if the distribution should be recorded as dividend income or a return of capital. Generally, we will not record distributions from such equity investments as dividend income unless there are sufficient earnings at the portfolio company prior to the distribution. Distributions that are classified as a return of capital are recorded as a reduction in the cost basis of the investment.\nFee Income\nWe receive a variety of fees in the ordinary course of business, including servicing, advisory, amendment, structuring and prepayment fees, which are classified as fee income and recognized as they are earned.\nPIK Interest Income\nOur investments in debt securities may contain PIK interest provisions. PIK interest, which represents contractually deferred interest added to the loan balance that is generally due at the end of the loan term, is generally recorded on the accrual basis to the extent such amounts are expected to be collected. We generally cease accruing PIK interest if there is insufficient value to support the accrual or if we do not expect the portfolio company to be able to pay all principal and interest due. Our decision to cease accruing PIK interest involves subjective judgments and determinations based on available information about a particular portfolio company, including whether the portfolio company is current with respect to its payment of principal and interest on its loans and debt securities; financial statements and financial projections for the portfolio company; our assessment of the portfolio company's business development success; information obtained by us in connection with periodic formal update interviews with the portfolio company's management and, if appropriate, the private equity sponsor; and information about the general economic and market conditions in which the portfolio company operates. Based on this and other information, we determine whether to cease accruing PIK interest on a loan or debt security. Our determination to cease accruing PIK interest is generally made well before our full write-down of a loan or debt security. In addition, if it is subsequently determined that we will not be able to collect any previously accrued PIK interest, the fair value of the loans or debt securities would be reduced by the amount of such previously accrued, but uncollectible, PIK interest. The accrual of PIK interest on our debt investments increases the recorded cost bases of these investments in our Consolidated Financial Statements and, as a result, increases the cost bases of these investments for purposes of computing the capital gains incentive fee payable by us to Oaktree beginning in the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019. To maintain our status as a RIC, income from PIK interest may be required to be distributed to our stockholders even though we have not yet collected the cash and may never do so.\nPortfolio Composition\nOur investments principally consist of senior loans in private middle-market companies and investments in the OCSI Glick JV. As of September 30, 2018, our senior loans were typically secured by a first or second lien on the assets of the portfolio company and generally had terms of up to ten years (but an expected average life of between three and four years). We believe the environment for direct lending remains active, and, as a result, a number of our portfolio companies were able to refinance and repay their loans during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2018, we originated $435.9 million of investment commitments in 56 new and six existing portfolio companies and funded $443.9 million of investments.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2018, we received $445.3 million of proceeds from prepayments, exits, other paydowns and sales and exited 51 portfolio companies.\nA summary of the

OCSI Glick JV\nIn October 2014, we entered into a LLC agreement with GF Equity Funding to form the OCSI Glick JV. On April 21, 2015, the OCSI Glick JV began investing in senior secured loans of middle-market companies. We co-invest in these securities with GF Equity Funding through the OCSI Glick JV. The OCSI Glick JV is managed by a four person Board of Directors, two of whom are selected by us and two of whom are selected by GF Equity Funding. The OCSI Glick JV is capitalized as transactions are completed, and portfolio decisions and investment decisions in respect of the OCSI Glick JV must be approved by the OCSI Glick JV investment committee, consisting of one representative selected by us and one representative selected by GF Equity Funding (with approval from a representative of each required). The members provide capital to the OCSI Glick JV in exchange for LLC equity interests, and we and GF Debt Funding, an entity advised by affiliates of GF Equity Funding, provide capital to the OCSI Glick JV in exchange for subordinated notes, or the Subordinated Notes. As of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, we and GF Equity Funding owned 87.5% and 12.5%, respectively, of the outstanding LLC equity interests, and we and GF Debt Funding owned 87.5% and 12.5%, respectively, of the Subordinated Notes. The OCSI Glick JV is not an \"eligible portfolio company\" as defined in section 2(a)(46) of the Investment Company Act.\nThe OCSI Glick JV's portfolio consisted of middle-market and other corporate debt securities of 31 and 23 portfolio companies as of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, respectively. The portfolio companies in the OCSI Glick JV are in industries similar to those in which we may invest directly.\nThe OCSI Glick JV entered into the JV Deutsche Bank Facility, which had a reinvestment period end date and maturity date of October 7, 2018 and October 7, 2023, respectively, and permitted borrowings of up to $125.0 million as of September 30, 2018. Borrowings under the JV Deutsche Bank Facility are secured by all of the assets of the OCSI Glick JV and all of the equity interests in the OCSI Glick JV. During the year ended September 30, 2018, the JV Deutsche Bank Facility was amended to (i) decrease the maximum permissible borrowings from $200 million to $125 million, (ii) extend the reinvestment period end date and maturity date to October 7, 2018 and October 7, 2023, respectively, and (iii) decrease the interest rate from the 3-month LIBOR plus 2.5% per annum with no LIBOR floor to the 3-month LIBOR plus 2.3% per annum with no LIBOR floor. The JV Deutsche Bank Facility was further amended on October 4, 2018 to extend the reinvestment period end and maturity date to January 7, 2019 and January 5, 2024, respectively. Under the JV Deutsche Bank Facility, $94.3 million and $56.9 million of borrowings were outstanding as of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, respectively.\nAs of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, the OCSI Glick JV had total assets of $166.2 million and $126.7 million, respectively. Our investment in the OCSI Glick JV consisted of LLC equity interests and Subordinated Notes of $58.5 million and $57.6 million in the aggregate at fair value as of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, respectively. The Subordinated Notes are junior in right of payment to the repayment of temporary contributions made by us to fund investments of the OCSI Glick JV that are repaid when GF Equity Funding and GF Debt Funding make their capital contributions and fund their Subordinated Notes, respectively.\nAs of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, the OCSI Glick JV had total capital commitments of $100.0 million, $87.5 million of which was from us and the remaining $12.5 million from GF Equity Funding and GF Debt Funding.

All interest rates are payable in cash, unless otherwise noted.\n(2) The interest rate on the principal balance outstanding for all floating rate loans is indexed to LIBOR and/or an alternate base rate (e.g., prime rate), which typically resets semi-annually, quarterly, or monthly at the borrower's option. The borrower may also elect to have multiple interest reset periods for each loan. For each of these loans, we have provided the applicable margin over LIBOR or the alternate base rate based on each respective credit agreement and the cash interest rate as of period end. All LIBOR shown above is in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted.

All interest rates are payable in cash, unless otherwise noted.\n(2) The interest rate on the principal balance outstanding for all floating rate loans is indexed to LIBOR and/or an alternate base rate (e.g., prime rate), which typically resets semi-annually, quarterly, or monthly at the borrower's option. The borrower may also elect to have multiple interest reset periods for each loan. For each of these loans, we have provided the applicable margin over LIBOR or the alternate base rate based on each respective credit agreement.\n(3) Represents the current determination of fair value as of September 30, 2017 utilizing a similar technique as us in accordance with ASC 820.

Cash non-accrual status is inclusive of PIK and other non-cash income, where applicable.\nThe cost and fair value of our aggregate investment in the OCSI Glick JV was $73.5 million and $58.5 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2018 and $71.3 million and $57.6 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2017. As of September 30, 2018, the Subordinated Notes paid a weighted average interest rate of LIBOR plus 6.5% per annum. As of September 30, 2017, the Subordinated Notes paid a weighted average interest rate of LIBOR plus 8.0% per annum. For the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we earned interest income of $6.1 million, $5.8 million and $5.1 million, respectively, on its investment in the Subordinated Notes, of which $2.2 million, $0.2 million and $0.0 million, respectively, was PIK interest income. The LLC equity interests are dividend producing to the extent there is residual cash to be distributed on a quarterly basis. We did not earn any dividend income for the year ended September 30, 2018 with respect to our investment in the LLC equity interests of the OCSI Glick JV. We reversed $0.6 million of dividend income previously recorded in prior periods during the year ended September 30, 2017 with respect to our LLC equity interests following a determination that such amounts were no longer collectible. We earned dividend income of $2.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2016 with respect to its LLC equity interests.\nBelow is certain summarized financial information for the OCSI Glick JV as of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017 and for the years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 30, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selected Balance Sheet Information:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investments in loans at fair value (cost September 30, 2018: $159,310,303; cost September 30, 2017: $116,978,493)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>160,260,951\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>108,737,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,055,935\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,891,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,036,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,249,575\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Due from portfolio companies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,653\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,781,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,791,077\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>166,187,881\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>126,677,663\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior credit facility payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>94,281,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56,881,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subordinated notes payable at fair value (proceeds September 30, 2018: $75,874,536; proceeds September 30, 2017: $73,404,435)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66,871,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65,836,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,034,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,959,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>166,187,881\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>126,677,663\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Members' equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total liabilities and members' equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>166,187,881\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>126,677,663\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\nSeptember 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\nSeptember 30, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selected Statements of Operations Information:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,823,972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,148,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PIK interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53,620\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fee income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77,999\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>160,984\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investment income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,901,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,362,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,433,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,055,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>211,874\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>224,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expenses (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,645,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,280,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,626,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,893,408\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized loss on investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,883,148\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,873,454\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,684,494\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________\n(1) There are no management fees or incentive fees charged at the OCSI Glick JV.\nThe OCSI Glick JV has elected to fair value the Subordinated Notes issued to the Company and GF Debt Funding under FASB ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments - Fair Value Options. The Subordinated Notes are valued based on the total assets less the liabilities senior to the Subordinated Notes of the OCSI Glick JV in an amount not exceeding par under the enterprise value technique.\nDuring the years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, we did not sell any debt investments to the OCSI Glick JV.\nDiscussion and Analysis of Results and Operations\nResults of Operations\nThe principal measure of our financial performance is the net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations, which includes net investment income, net realized gain (loss) and net unrealized appreciation (depreciation). Net investment income is the difference between our income from interest, dividends, fees, and other investment income and total expenses. Net realized gain (loss) is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of investment related assets and liabilities and their stated costs. Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) is the net change in the fair value of our investment related assets and liabilities which are carried at fair value during the reporting period, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation (depreciation) when gains or losses are realized.\nComparison of Years Ended September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017\nTotal Investment Income\nTotal investment income includes interest on our investments, fee income and dividend and other income.\nTotal investment income for the years ended September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017 was $47.7 million and $46.6 million, respectively. For the year ended September 30, 2018, this amount primarily consisted of $45.6 million of interest income from portfolio investments (which included $2.2 million of PIK interest) and $2.1 million of fee income. For the year ended September 30, 2017, this amount primarily consisted of $44.9 million of interest income from portfolio investments (which included $0.4 million of PIK interest) and $2.2 million of fee income. The increase of $1.1 million in our total investment income for the year ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the year ended September 30, 2017, was due primarily to a $2.0 million one-time acceleration of interest income in connection with the repayment of our investment in Allen Media LLC and a $0.6 million increase of dividend income, which was primarily attributable to a reversal of dividend income during the year ended September 30, 2017, partially offset by a lower yield on our debt investments.\nExpenses\nNet expenses (expenses net of fee waivers and insurance recoveries) for the year ended September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017 were $27.9 million and $24.2 million, respectively. The increase of $3.7 million in our net expenses for the year ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the year ended September 30, 2017, was primarily due to a $3.6 million increase in interest expense, which was attributable to a $2.0 million write-off of previously unamortized financing costs in connection with the redemption of our $309.0 million debt securitization, or the 2015 Debt Securitization, and increases in LIBOR, a $1.4 million increase in professional fees (net of insurance recoveries) and a $0.4 million increase in administrator expense, partially offset by a $1.0 million decrease in incentive fees on income (net of fee waivers), which was attributable to lower pre-incentive fee net investment income, and a $0.6 million decrease in general and administrative expenses.\nNet Investment Income\nAs a result of the $1.1 million increase in total investment income and the $3.7 million increase in net expenses, net investment income for the year ended September 30, 2018 decreased by approximately $2.7 million, as compared to the year ended September 30, 2017.\nRealized Gain (Loss)\nRealized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the sale or redemption of investments, secured borrowings and foreign currency and the cost basis without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, and includes investments written-off during the period, net of recoveries. Realized losses may also be recorded in connection with our determination that certain investments are considered worthless securities and/or meet the conditions for loss recognition per the applicable tax rules.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2018, we recorded an aggregate net realized loss of $27.7 million primarily in connection with the exit of our investments in Ameritox Ltd. and Metamorph US 3, LLC. During the year ended September 30, 2017, we recorded an aggregate net realized loss of $13.4 million primarily in connection with the exit of our investment in the Answers Corporation.\nSee Note 9. Realized Gains or Losses and Net Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation on Investments\u201d in the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details regarding realized gain (loss) on investments for the years ended September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017.\nNet Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation)\nNet unrealized appreciation or depreciation is the net change in the fair value of our investments, secured borrowings and foreign currency during the reporting period, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation when gains or losses are realized.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2018, we recorded net unrealized appreciation of $28.6 million. For the year ended September 30, 2018, this consisted of $29.0 million of net reclassifications to realized loss (resulting in unrealized appreciation), which was primarily related to the disposal of our investments in Ameritox Ltd. and Metamorph US 3, LLC, and $1.0 million of net unrealized appreciation on equity investments, offset by $1.4 million of net unrealized depreciation on debt investments.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2017, we recorded net unrealized depreciation of $17.8 million. This consisted of $14.1 million of net unrealized depreciation on debt investments and $12.9 million of net unrealized depreciation on equity investments, both of which were primarily related to the write-downs of three of our investments, offset by $9.2 million of net reclassifications to realized loss (resulting in unrealized appreciation), which was primarily in connection with our disposal of our investment in the Answers Corporation.\nComparison of Years Ended September 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016\nTotal Investment Income\nTotal investment income includes interest on our investments, fee income and other investment income.\nTotal investment income for the years ended September 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016 was $46.6 million and $53.4 million, respectively. For the year ended September 30, 2017, this amount primarily consisted of $44.9 million of interest income from portfolio investments (which included $0.4 million of PIK interest) and $2.2 million of fee income. For the year ended September 30, 2016, this amount primarily consisted of $47.6 million of interest income from portfolio investments (which included $0.2 million of PIK interest), $3.1 million of fee income and $2.7 million of dividend income. The decrease of $6.9 million in our total investment income for the year ended September 30, 2017, as compared to the year ended September 30, 2016, was primarily attributable to a lower weighted average annual yield on our debt investments and lower dividend income earned on our investment in OCSI Glick JV. The weighted average annual yield on our debt investments as of September 30, 2017, including the return on the Subordinated Notes, was approximately 7.52%, as compared to 8.58% as of September 30, 2016.\nExpenses\nNet expenses (expenses net of base management fee waivers and insurance recoveries) for the years ended September 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016 were $24.2 million and $28.1 million, respectively. The decrease of $3.9 million in our net expenses for the year ended September 30, 2017, as compared to the year ended September 30, 2016, was primarily due to a $2.9 million decrease in professional fees (net of insurance recoveries) incurred in connection with proxy-related matters, a $2.0 million decrease in incentive fees on income payable to our investment adviser, which was attributable to lower pre-incentive fee net investment income for the year-over-year period, partially offset by a $1.2 million increase in interest expense attributable to higher interest rates in the current year.\nNet Investment Income\nAs a result of the $6.9 million decrease in total investment income, offset by the $3.9 million decrease in net expenses, net investment income for the year ended September 30, 2017 reflected an approximate $2.9 million decrease, as compared to the year ended September 30, 2016.\nRealized Gain (Loss)\nRealized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the sale or redemption of portfolio investments and the cost basis of the investments without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, and includes investments written-off during the period, net of recoveries. Realized losses may also be recorded in connection with our determination that certain investments are considered worthless securities and/or meet the conditions for loss recognition per the applicable tax rules.\nRealized losses on investments and secured borrowings increased from $12.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2016 to $13.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2017. Realized losses for the year ended September 30, 2017 were primarily attributable to the sale of our investment in Answers Corporation. Realized losses for the year ended September 30, 2016 were primarily attributable to the restructuring of our investment in Ameritox Ltd. and the disposition of our investment in B&H Education Inc.\nSee Note 9. Realized Gains or Losses and Net Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation on Investments\u201d in the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details regarding realized gain (loss) on investments and secured borrowings for the years ended September 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016.\nNet Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation)\nNet unrealized appreciation or depreciation is the net change in the fair value of our investments and secured borrowings during the reporting period, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation when gains or losses are realized.\nNet unrealized depreciation on investments and secured borrowings increased from $17.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2016 to $17.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2017. Net unrealized depreciation for the year ended September 30, 2017 was primarily the result of significant write-downs on our investment portfolio, including a $13.6 million write-down on one of our investments. Net unrealized depreciation on investments and secured borrowings for the year ended September 30, 2016 was primarily the result of significant write-downs on our investment portfolio, including $11.9 million of aggregate write-downs on one of our investments and OCSI Glick JV.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have a number of alternatives available to fund our investment portfolio and our operations, including raising equity, increasing or refinancing debt and funding from operational cash flow. We generally expect to fund the growth of our investment portfolio through (i) equity offerings in public or private offerings, which offerings will depend on future market conditions, funding needs and other factors and (ii) additional debt capital (to the extent permissible under the Investment Company Act). In the future, we may also securitize a portion of our investments. To securitize investments, we would likely create a wholly-owned subsidiary and contribute a pool of loans to the subsidiary. We would then sell interests in the subsidiary on a non-recourse basis to purchasers and we would retain all or a portion of the equity in the subsidiary. We cannot assure you, however, that our efforts to grow our portfolio will be successful. For example, our common stock has generally traded at prices below net asset value for the past several years, and we are currently limited in our ability to raise additional equity at prices below the then-current net asset value per share. Additionally, to generate liquidity we may reduce investment size by syndicating a portion of any given transaction. We intend to continue to generate cash primarily from cash flows from operations, including interest earned and future borrowings. We intend to fund our future distribution obligations through operating cash flow or with funds obtained through future equity and debt offerings or credit facilities, as we deem appropriate.\nOur primary uses of funds are investments in our targeted asset classes and cash distributions to holders of our common stock. Following effectiveness of the 150% reduced asset coverage requirements to us on July 11, 2018, over time and under current market conditions, we generally expect to target a debt to equity ratio of 1.20x to 1.60x over the long-term (i.e., one dollar of equity for each $1.20 to $1.60 of debt outstanding).\nFor the year ended September 30, 2018, we experienced a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $25.2 million. During that period, $16.9 million of cash was used in operating activities, primarily consisting of cash used to fund $455.0 million of investments and net revolvers, a decrease in net payables from unsettled transactions of $44.7 million and the cash activities related to $19.8 million of net investment income, partially offset by $464.3 million of principal payments and proceeds from the sale of investments. During the same period, cash used in financing activities was $8.2 million, primarily consisting of $192.1 million of net borrowings under our credit facilities, $180.0 million of net repayments of notes payable under the 2015 Debt Securitization, $18.3 million of cash distributions paid to our stockholders and $1.8 million of deferred financing costs paid.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2017, we experienced a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of $15.8 million. During that period, $68.8 million of cash was provided by operating activities, primarily consisting of $276.9 million of principal payments and proceeds from the sale of investments and cash activities related to $22.4 million of net investment income, partially offset by cash used to fund $290.6 million of investments and net revolvers. During the same period, cash used in financing activities was $53.0 million, primarily consisting of $24.5 million of net repayments under our credit facilities, $23.2 million of cash distributions paid to our stockholders and $5.0 million of repayments of secured borrowings.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2016, we experienced a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $21.7 million. During that period, $40.9 million of cash was provided by operating activities, primarily consisting of $308.4 million of principal payments and proceeds from the sale of investments and cash activities related to $25.3 million of net investment income, partially offset by cash used to fund $286.1 million of investments and net revolvers. During the same period, cash used by financing activities was $62.6 million, primarily consisting of $29.2 million of net repayments under our credit facilities, $6.4 million of net repayments under the 2015 Debt Securitization and $25.9 million of cash distributions paid to our shareholders.\nAs of September 30, 2018, we had $16.4 million of cash and cash equivalents (including $6.0 million of restricted cash), portfolio investments (at fair value) of $556.8 million, $3.1 million of interest, dividends and fees receivable, $3.8 million of net payables from unsettled transactions, $275.1 million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facilities and unfunded commitments of $22.8 million. Pursuant to the terms of the Citibank Facility, we are restricted in terms of access to $3.4 million of cash until the occurrence of the periodic distribution dates and, in connection therewith, our submission of our required periodic reporting schedules and verifications of our compliance with the terms of the credit agreement. As of September 30, 2018, $1.8 million of cash was restricted due to the obligation to pay interest under the terms of the Deutsche Bank Facility.

as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code for tax purposes. As long as we continue to qualify as a RIC, we will not be subject to tax on our investment company taxable income (determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid) or realized net capital gains, to the extent that such taxable income or gains is distributed, or deemed to be distributed as dividends, to stockholders on a timely basis.\nTaxable income generally differs from net income for financial reporting purposes due to temporary and permanent differences in the recognition of income and expenses, and generally excludes net unrealized appreciation or depreciation. Distributions declared and paid by us in a taxable year may differ from taxable income for that taxable year as such distributions may include the distribution of taxable\nincome derived from the current taxable year or the distribution of taxable income derived from the prior taxable year carried forward into and distributed in the current taxable year. Distributions also may include returns of capital.\nTo maintain RIC tax treatment, we must, among other things, distribute dividends, with respect to each taxable year, of an amount at least equal to 90% of our investment company taxable income (i.e., our net ordinary income and our realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any) determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid. As a RIC, we are also subject to a federal excise tax, based on distribution requirements of our taxable income on a calendar year basis. We anticipate timely distribution of our taxable income in accordance with tax rules. We did not incur a U.S. federal excise tax for calendar years 2016 and 2017 and do not expect to incur a U.S. federal excise tax for the calendar year 2018. We may incur a federal excise tax in future years.\nWe intend to distribute at least 90% of our annual taxable income (which includes our taxable interest and fee income) to our stockholders. The covenants under the respective documents governing the Citibank Facility, the East West Bank Facility and the Deutsche Bank Facility could, under certain circumstances, hinder our ability to satisfy the distribution requirement associated with our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC. In addition, we may retain for investment some or all of our net capital gains (i.e., realized net long-term capital gains in excess of realized net short-term capital losses) and treat such amounts as deemed distributions to our stockholders. If we do this, our stockholders will be treated as if they received actual distributions of the capital gains we retained and then reinvested the net after-tax proceeds in our common stock. Our stockholders also may be eligible to claim tax credits (or, in certain circumstances, tax refunds) equal to their allocable share of the tax we paid on the capital gains deemed distributed to them. To the extent our taxable earnings for a fiscal and taxable year fall below the total amount of our distributions for that fiscal and taxable year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our stockholders.\nWe may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time. In addition, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions due to the asset coverage test for borrowings applicable to us as a Business Development Company under the Investment Company Act and due to provisions in our credit facilities and debt instruments. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our taxable income annually, we will suffer adverse tax consequences, including possible loss of our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions or distributions at a particular level.\nA RIC may treat a distribution of its own stock as fulfilling its RIC distribution requirements if each stockholder elects to receive his or her entire distribution in either cash or stock of the RIC, subject to certain limitations regarding the aggregate amount of cash to be distributed to all stockholders. If these and certain other requirements are met, for U.S federal income tax purposes, the amount of the dividend paid in stock will be equal to the amount of cash that could have been received instead of stock. We have no current intention of paying dividends in shares of our stock in accordance with these guidelines.\nWe may generate qualified net interest income or qualified net short-term capital gains that may be exempt from U.S. withholding tax when distributed to foreign stockholders. A RIC is permitted to designate distributions of qualified net interest income and qualified short-term capital gains as exempt from U.S. withholding tax when paid to non-U.S. shareholders with proper documentation. The following table, which may be subject to change as we finalize our annual tax filings, lists the percentage of qualified net interest income and qualified short-term capital gains for the year ended September 30, 2018, our last tax year end. Table 154: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Qualified Net Interest Income\n</td> <td>Qualified Short-Term Capital Gains\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have adopted a DRIP that provides for the reinvestment of any distributions that we declare in cash on behalf of our stockholders, unless a stockholder elects to receive cash. As a result, if our Board of Directors declares a cash distribution, then our stockholders who have not opted out\u201d of the DRIP will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, rather than receiving a cash distribution. If our shares are trading at a premium to net asset value, we typically issue new shares to implement the DRIP, with such shares issued at the greater of the most recently computed net asset value per share of our common stock or 95% of the current market value per share of our common stock on the payment date for such distribution. If our shares are trading at a discount to net asset value, we typically purchase shares in the open market in connection with our obligations under the DRIP.\nRelated Party Transactions\nWe have entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with Oaktree and the Administration Agreement with Oaktree Administrator, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Oaktree. Mr. John B. Frank, an interested member of our Board of Directors, has an indirect pecuniary interest in Oaktree. Oaktree is a registered investment adviser under the Advisers Act that is partially and indirectly owned by OCG. See Note 11. Related Party Transactions - Investment Advisory Agreement\u201d and - Administrative Services\u201d in the notes to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPrior to October 17, 2017, we were externally managed and advised by our Former Adviser, and our administrator was FSC CT LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of our Former Adviser. Messrs. Bernard D. Berman, Patrick J. Dalton, Ivelin M. Dimitrov, Alexander C.\nFrank and Todd G. Owens, each an interested member of our Board of Directors for all or a portion of our fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 and prior to October 17, 2017, had a direct or indirect pecuniary interest in our Former Adviser.\nWe served as collateral manager to FS Senior Funding Ltd. under a collateral management agreement in connection with the 2015 Debt Securitization and were entitled to receive a fee for providing these services. We retained a sub-collateral manager, which was Oaktree from October 17, 2017 to September 24, 2018, to provide collateral management sub-advisory services to us pursuant to a sub-collateral management agreement. The sub-collateral manager was entitled to receive 100% of the collateral management fees paid to us under the collateral management agreement, but Oaktree irrevocably waived its right to such sub-collateral management fees in respect of the 2015 Debt Securitization.\nRecent Developments\nDistribution Declaration\nOn November 19, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly distribution of $0.155 per share, payable on December 28, 2018 to stockholders of record on December 17, 2018.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nSee Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and the anticipated impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.", "item_7_text": "Item 7.

We are a closed-end, externally managed, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a Business Development Company under the Investment Company Act. In addition, we have qualified and elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code for tax purposes.\nAs of October 17, 2017, we are externally managed by Oaktree, a subsidiary of OCG, pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement. Oaktree Administrator provides certain administrative and other services necessary for us to operate pursuant to the Administration Agreement.\nWe seek to generate a stable source of current income while minimizing the risk of principal loss and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation by providing innovative first-lien financing solutions to companies across a wide variety of industries. We invest in companies across a variety of industries that typically possess business models we expect to be resilient in the future with underlying fundamentals that will provide strength in future downturns. We intend to deploy capital across credit and economic cycles with a focus on long-term results, which we believe will enable us to build lasting partnerships with financial sponsors and management teams. We invest in unsecured loans, including subordinated loans, issued by private middle-market companies and, to a lesser extent, senior and subordinated loans issued by public companies and equity investments. Prior to January 18, 2018, under normal market conditions, we were required to invest at least 80% of the value of our net assets plus borrowings for investment purposes in floating rate senior loans, which include both first and second lien secured debt financings.\nOaktree intends to reposition our portfolio in order to (1) rotate out of a small number of investments that it views as challenged, (2) focus on increasing the size of our core private investments and (3) supplement the portfolio with broadly syndicated and select privately\nplaced loans. Our Adviser is generally focused on middle-market companies, which we define as companies with enterprise values of between $100 million and $750 million. Going forward, we expect our portfolio to include primarily first lien floating rate senior secured financings. We expect to target investments of $10 million to $20 million, on average, although we may invest more or less in certain portfolio companies. We generally invest in securities that are rated below investment grade by rating agencies or that would be rated below investment grade if they were rated. Below investment grade securities, which are often referred to as high yield\u201d and junk,\u201d have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer's capacity to pay interest and repay principal.\nSince becoming our investment adviser, Oaktree has performed a comprehensive review of our portfolio and categorized our portfolio into core investments, non-core performing investments and non-accrual investments. Certain additional information on such categorization and our portfolio composition is included in investor presentations that we file with the SEC.\nSince becoming our investment adviser, Oaktree has reduced the investments it has identified as non-core by approximately $235 million, at fair value. Over time, Oaktree intends to rotate us out of the approximately $59 million of non-core investments at fair value that remain as of September 30, 2018. In addition, over time and under current market conditions, Oaktree generally expects to increase leverage to a debt to equity ratio of 1.20x to 1.60x following effectiveness of the 150% reduced asset coverage requirements to us on July 11, 2018.\nBusiness Environment and Developments\nWe believe that the shift of commercial banks away from lending to middle-market companies following the 2008 financial crisis, including as a result of the passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the adoption of the Basel III Accord continues to create opportunities for non-bank lenders such as us. We believe middle-market companies represent a significant opportunity for direct lending as there are nearly 200,000 middle-market businesses, representing one-third of private sector gross domestic product and accounting for approximately 48 million jobs according to the National Center for the Middle Market. In addition, according to the S&P Global Market Intelligence LCD Middle Market Review, during the first nine months of the 2018 calendar year, middle-market lending volume exceeded $20 billion for deal sizes of less than $350 million.\nWe believe that quantitative easing and other similar monetary policies implemented by central banks worldwide in reaction to the 2008 financial crisis have created significant inflows of capital, including from private equity sponsors, focused on yield-driven products such as sub-investment grade debt. While we believe that private equity sponsors continue to have a large pool of available capital and will continue to pursue acquisitions in the middle market, increased competition from other lenders to middle-market companies together with increased capital focused on the sector have led to spread compression across the middle market, resulting in spreads near historically low levels.\nWe believe that the fundamentals of middle-market companies remain strong. In this environment, we believe attractive risk-adjusted returns can be achieved by investing in companies that cannot efficiently access traditional debt capital markets. We believe that the Company has the resources and experience to source, diligence and structure investments in these companies and is well placed to generate attractive returns for investors.\nInvestment Advisory Agreement with Oaktree\nUpon the closing of the Transaction contemplated by the Purchase Agreement on October 17, 2017, Oaktree became the investment adviser to each of OCSL and us. The closing of the Transaction resulted in an assignment for purposes of the Investment Company Act of the Former Investment Advisory Agreement, and, as a result, its immediate termination. See Note 11. Related Party Transactions- Investment Advisory Agreement\u201d and - Administrative Services\u201d in the notes to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAsset Coverage Requirements\nOn March 23, 2018, the SBCAA was enacted into law. The SBCAA, among other things, amended Section 61(a) of the Investment Company Act to add a new Section 61(a)(2) that reduces the asset coverage requirements applicable to Business Development Companies from 200% to 150% so long as the Business Development Company meets certain disclosure requirements and obtains certain approvals. The reduced asset coverage requirements permit a Business Development Company to have a debt to equity ratio of a maximum of 2x (i.e. $2 of debt outstanding for each $1 of equity) as compared to a maximum of 1x (i.e. $1 of debt outstanding for each $1 of equity) under the 200% asset coverage requirement. Effectiveness of the reduced asset coverage requirements to a Business Development Company requires approval by either (1) a required majority,\u201d as defined in Section 57(o) of the Investment Company Act, of such Business Development Company's Board of Directors with effectiveness one year after the date of such approval or (2) a majority of votes cast at a special or annual meeting of such Business Development Company's stockholders at which a quorum is present, which is effective the day after such stockholder approval.\nAt a meeting held on May 3, 2018, our Board of Directors, including a required majority\u201d of the directors, as defined in Section 57(o) of the Investment Company Act, approved the application of the reduced asset coverage requirements in Section 61(a)(2) of the Investment Company Act as being in the best interests of us and our stockholders. At a special meeting of our stockholders held on July 10, 2018, our stockholders approved the application of the reduced asset coverage requirements in Section 61(a)(2) of the Investment Company Act to us effective as of July 11, 2018. The reduced asset coverage requirements permit us to double the maximum amount of\nleverage that we are permitted to incur by reducing the asset coverage requirements applicable to us from 200% to 150%. As of September 30, 2018, we had $275.1 million in senior securities outstanding and our asset coverage ratio was 207.5%.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-K and Regulation S-X. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. We are an investment company following the accounting and reporting guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 946, Financial Services-Investment Companies, or ASC 946.\nInvestment Valuation\nWe value our investments in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, or ASC 820, which defines fair value as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We report our investments for which current market values are not readily available at fair value. A liability's fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. ASC 820 prioritizes the use of observable market prices derived from such prices over entity-specific inputs. Where observable prices or inputs are not available or reliable, valuation techniques are applied. These valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the investments or market and the investments' complexity.\nHierarchical levels, defined by ASC 820 and directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuation of these assets and liabilities, are as follows:\n \u2022 Level 1 - Unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the measurement date. \n \u2022 Level 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data at the measurement date for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. \n \u2022 Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that reflect management's best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model.  If inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, an investment's level is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the investment. This includes investment securities that are valued using \"bid\" and \"ask\" prices obtained from independent third party pricing services or directly from brokers. These investments may be classified as Level 3 because the quoted prices may be indicative in nature for securities that are in an inactive market, may be for similar securities or may require adjustments for investment-specific factors or restrictions.\nFinancial instruments with readily available quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment inherent in measuring fair value. As such, Oaktree obtains and analyzes readily available market quotations provided by pricing vendors and brokers for all of our investments for which quotations are available. In determining the fair value of a particular investment, pricing vendors and brokers use observable market information, including both binding and non-binding indicative quotations.\nWe seek to obtain at least two quotations for the subject or similar securities, typically from pricing vendors. If we are unable to obtain two quotes from pricing vendors, or if the prices obtained from pricing vendors are not within our set threshold, we seek to obtain a quote directly from a broker making a market for the asset. Oaktree evaluates the quotations provided by pricing vendors and brokers based on available market information, including trading activity of the subject or similar securities, or by performing a comparable security analysis to ensure that fair values are reasonably estimated. Oaktree also performs back-testing of valuation information obtained from pricing vendors and brokers against actual prices received in transactions. In addition to ongoing monitoring and back-testing, Oaktree performs due diligence procedures over pricing vendors to understand their methodology and controls to support their use in the valuation process. Generally, we do not adjust any of the prices received from these sources.\nIf the quotations obtained from pricing vendors or brokers are determined to not be reliable or are not readily available, we value such investments using any of three different valuation techniques. The first valuation technique is the transaction precedent technique, which utilizes recent or expected future transactions of the investment to determine fair value, to the extent applicable. The second valuation technique is an analysis of the enterprise value, or EV, of the portfolio company. EV means the entire value of the portfolio\ncompany to a market participant, including the sum of the values of debt and equity securities used to capitalize the enterprise at a point in time. The EV analysis is typically performed to determine (i) the value of equity investments, (ii) whether there is credit impairment for debt investments and (iii) the value for debt investments that we are deemed to control under the Investment Company Act. To estimate the EV of a portfolio company, Oaktree analyzes various factors, including the portfolio company's historical and projected financial results, macroeconomic impacts on the company, and competitive dynamics in the company's industry. Oaktree also utilizes some or all of the following information based on the individual circumstances of the portfolio company: (i) valuations of comparable public companies, (ii) recent sales of private and public comparable companies in similar industries or having similar business or earnings characteristics, (iii) purchase price multiples as a multiple of their earnings or cash flow, (iv) the portfolio company's ability to meet its forecasts and its business prospects, (v) a discounted cash flow analysis, (vi) estimated liquidation or collateral value of the portfolio company's assets and (vii) offers from third parties to buy the portfolio company. We may probability weight potential sale outcomes with respect to a portfolio company when uncertainty exists as of the valuation date. The third valuation technique is a market yield technique, which is typically performed for non-credit impaired debt investments. In the market yield technique, a current price is imputed for the investment based upon an assessment of the expected market yield for a similarly structured investment with a similar level of risk, and we consider the current contractual interest rate, the capital structure and other terms of the investment relative to risk of the company and the specific investment. A key determinant of risk, among other things, is the leverage through the investment relative to the EV of the portfolio company. As debt investments held by us are substantially illiquid with no active transaction market, we depend on primary market data, including newly funded transactions and industry specific market movements, as well as secondary market data with respect to high yield debt instruments and syndicated loans, as inputs in determining the appropriate market yield, as applicable.\nIn accordance with ASC 820-10, certain investments that qualify as investment companies in accordance with ASC 946 may be valued using net asset value as a practical expedient for fair value. Consistent with FASB guidance under ASC 820, these investments are excluded from the hierarchical levels.\nWe estimate the fair value of privately held warrants using a Black Scholes pricing model, which includes an analysis of various factors and subjective assumptions, including the current stock price (by using an EV analysis as described above), the expected period until exercise, expected volatility of the underlying stock price, expected dividends and the risk-free rate. Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates.\nOur Board of Directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter in connection with determining the fair value of our investments:\n \u2022 The quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by Oaktree's valuation team in conjunction with Oaktree's portfolio management team and investment professionals responsible for each portfolio investment;  \u2022Preliminary valuations are then reviewed and discussed with management of Oaktree;\n \u2022 Separately, independent valuation firms engaged by our Board of Directors prepare valuations of our investments, on a selected basis, for which market quotations are not readily available or are readily available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of the investment, and submit the reports to us and provide such reports to Oaktree and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors; \n \u2022 Oaktree compares and contrasts its preliminary valuations to the valuations of the independent valuation firms and prepares a valuation report for the Audit Committee; \n \u2022 The Audit Committee reviews the preliminary valuations with Oaktree, and Oaktree responds and supplements the preliminary valuations to reflect any discussions between Oaktree and the Audit Committee; \n \u2022 The Audit Committee makes a recommendation to our full Board of Directors regarding the fair value of the investments in our portfolio; and \n \u2022 Our Board of Directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio.  The fair value of our investments as of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017 was determined in good faith by our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors has and will continue to engage independent valuation firms to provide assistance regarding the determination of the fair value of a portion of our portfolio securities for which market quotations are not readily available or are readily available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of the investment each quarter, and the Board of Directors may reasonably rely on that assistance. As of September 30, 2018, 95.0% of our portfolio at fair value was valued either based on market quotations, the transactions precedent approach or corroborated by independent valuation firms. However, our Board of Directors is responsible for the ultimate valuation of the portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to our valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process.\nAs of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, approximately 95.2% and 92.1%, respectively, of our total assets represented investments at fair value.\nRevenue Recognition\nInterest and Dividend Income\nInterest income, adjusted for accretion of OID, is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected. We stop accruing interest on investments when it is determined that interest is no longer collectible. Investments that are expected to pay regularly scheduled interest in cash are generally placed on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest cash payments will be collected. Cash interest payments received on investments may be recognized as income or a return of capital depending upon management's judgment. A non-accrual investment is restored to accrual status if past due principal and interest are paid in cash, and the portfolio company, in management's judgment, is likely to continue timely payment of its remaining obligations. As of September 30, 2018, there was one investment on which we had stopped accruing cash and/or PIK interest or OID income.\nIn connection with our investment in a portfolio company, we sometimes receive nominal cost equity that is valued as part of the negotiation process with the portfolio company. When we receive nominal cost equity, we allocate our cost basis in the investment between debt securities and the nominal cost equity at the time of origination. Any resulting discount from recording the loan, or otherwise purchasing a security at a discount, is accreted into interest income over the life of the loan.\nWe generally recognize dividend income on the ex-dividend date. Distributions received from equity investments are evaluated to determine if the distribution should be recorded as dividend income or a return of capital. Generally, we will not record distributions from such equity investments as dividend income unless there are sufficient earnings at the portfolio company prior to the distribution. Distributions that are classified as a return of capital are recorded as a reduction in the cost basis of the investment.\nFee Income\nWe receive a variety of fees in the ordinary course of business, including servicing, advisory, amendment, structuring and prepayment fees, which are classified as fee income and recognized as they are earned.\nPIK Interest Income\nOur investments in debt securities may contain PIK interest provisions. PIK interest, which represents contractually deferred interest added to the loan balance that is generally due at the end of the loan term, is generally recorded on the accrual basis to the extent such amounts are expected to be collected. We generally cease accruing PIK interest if there is insufficient value to support the accrual or if we do not expect the portfolio company to be able to pay all principal and interest due. Our decision to cease accruing PIK interest involves subjective judgments and determinations based on available information about a particular portfolio company, including whether the portfolio company is current with respect to its payment of principal and interest on its loans and debt securities; financial statements and financial projections for the portfolio company; our assessment of the portfolio company's business development success; information obtained by us in connection with periodic formal update interviews with the portfolio company's management and, if appropriate, the private equity sponsor; and information about the general economic and market conditions in which the portfolio company operates. Based on this and other information, we determine whether to cease accruing PIK interest on a loan or debt security. Our determination to cease accruing PIK interest is generally made well before our full write-down of a loan or debt security. In addition, if it is subsequently determined that we will not be able to collect any previously accrued PIK interest, the fair value of the loans or debt securities would be reduced by the amount of such previously accrued, but uncollectible, PIK interest. The accrual of PIK interest on our debt investments increases the recorded cost bases of these investments in our Consolidated Financial Statements and, as a result, increases the cost bases of these investments for purposes of computing the capital gains incentive fee payable by us to Oaktree beginning in the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019. To maintain our status as a RIC, income from PIK interest may be required to be distributed to our stockholders even though we have not yet collected the cash and may never do so.\nPortfolio Composition\nOur investments principally consist of senior loans in private middle-market companies and investments in the OCSI Glick JV. As of September 30, 2018, our senior loans were typically secured by a first or second lien on the assets of the portfolio company and generally had terms of up to ten years (but an expected average life of between three and four years). We believe the environment for direct lending remains active, and, as a result, a number of our portfolio companies were able to refinance and repay their loans during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2018, we originated $435.9 million of investment commitments in 56 new and six existing portfolio companies and funded $443.9 million of investments.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2018, we received $445.3 million of proceeds from prepayments, exits, other paydowns and sales and exited 51 portfolio companies.\nA summary of the composition of our investment portfolio at cost and fair value as a percentage of total investments is shown in the following tables:\n\n\nThe industry composition of our portfolio at cost and fair value as a percentage of total investments was as follows:\n\n\n___________________\n (1) As of September 30, 2018, certain industry classifications were modified primarily as a result of changes to industry information provided by a third party source. We disclosed both the revised and previously reported industry classifications as of September 30, 2017 above. \n (2) This industry includes our investment in the OCSI Glick JV.  Loans and Debt Securities on Non-Accrual Status\nAs of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, there were one and three investments, respectively, on which we stopped accruing cash and/or PIK interest or OID income.\nThe percentages of our debt investments at cost and fair value by accrual status as of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017 were as follows:\n\n__________________\n (1) Cash non-accrual status is inclusive of PIK and other non-cash income, where applicable.  OCSI Glick JV\nIn October 2014, we entered into a LLC agreement with GF Equity Funding to form the OCSI Glick JV. On April 21, 2015, the OCSI Glick JV began investing in senior secured loans of middle-market companies. We co-invest in these securities with GF Equity Funding through the OCSI Glick JV. The OCSI Glick JV is managed by a four person Board of Directors, two of whom are selected by us and two of whom are selected by GF Equity Funding. The OCSI Glick JV is capitalized as transactions are completed, and portfolio decisions and investment decisions in respect of the OCSI Glick JV must be approved by the OCSI Glick JV investment committee, consisting of one representative selected by us and one representative selected by GF Equity Funding (with approval from a representative of each required). The members provide capital to the OCSI Glick JV in exchange for LLC equity interests, and we and GF Debt Funding, an entity advised by affiliates of GF Equity Funding, provide capital to the OCSI Glick JV in exchange for subordinated notes, or the Subordinated Notes. As of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, we and GF Equity Funding owned 87.5% and 12.5%, respectively, of the outstanding LLC equity interests, and we and GF Debt Funding owned 87.5% and 12.5%, respectively, of the Subordinated Notes. The OCSI Glick JV is not an \"eligible portfolio company\" as defined in section 2(a)(46) of the Investment Company Act.\nThe OCSI Glick JV's portfolio consisted of middle-market and other corporate debt securities of 31 and 23 portfolio companies as of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, respectively. The portfolio companies in the OCSI Glick JV are in industries similar to those in which we may invest directly.\nThe OCSI Glick JV entered into the JV Deutsche Bank Facility, which had a reinvestment period end date and maturity date of October 7, 2018 and October 7, 2023, respectively, and permitted borrowings of up to $125.0 million as of September 30, 2018. Borrowings under the JV Deutsche Bank Facility are secured by all of the assets of the OCSI Glick JV and all of the equity interests in the OCSI Glick JV. During the year ended September 30, 2018, the JV Deutsche Bank Facility was amended to (i) decrease the maximum permissible borrowings from $200 million to $125 million, (ii) extend the reinvestment period end date and maturity date to October 7, 2018 and October 7, 2023, respectively, and (iii) decrease the interest rate from the 3-month LIBOR plus 2.5% per annum with no LIBOR floor to the 3-month LIBOR plus 2.3% per annum with no LIBOR floor. The JV Deutsche Bank Facility was further amended on October 4, 2018 to extend the reinvestment period end and maturity date to January 7, 2019 and January 5, 2024, respectively. Under the JV Deutsche Bank Facility, $94.3 million and $56.9 million of borrowings were outstanding as of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, respectively.\nAs of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, the OCSI Glick JV had total assets of $166.2 million and $126.7 million, respectively. Our investment in the OCSI Glick JV consisted of LLC equity interests and Subordinated Notes of $58.5 million and $57.6 million in the aggregate at fair value as of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, respectively. The Subordinated Notes are junior in right of payment to the repayment of temporary contributions made by us to fund investments of the OCSI Glick JV that are repaid when GF Equity Funding and GF Debt Funding make their capital contributions and fund their Subordinated Notes, respectively.\nAs of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, the OCSI Glick JV had total capital commitments of $100.0 million, $87.5 million of which was from us and the remaining $12.5 million from GF Equity Funding and GF Debt Funding. Approximately $84.0 million and $81.6 million in aggregate commitments was funded as of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, respectively, of which\n$73.5 million and $71.4 million, respectively, was from us. As of each of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, we had commitments to fund Subordinated Notes to the OCSI Glick JV of $78.8 million, of which $12.4 million and $14.5 million, respectively, was unfunded. As of each of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, we had commitments to fund LLC equity interests in the OCSI Glick JV of $8.7 million, of which $1.6 million was unfunded as of each such date.\nBelow is a summary of the OCSI Glick JV's portfolio, followed by a listing of the individual loans in the OCSI Glick JV's portfolio as of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017:\n\n__________\n(1) At principal amount.\n(2) Computed using the weighted average annual interest rate on accruing senior secured loans at fair value.\nOCSI Glick JV Portfolio as of September 30, 2018\n\n__________\n(1) Represents the current interest rate as of September 30, 2018. All interest rates are payable in cash, unless otherwise noted.\n(2) The interest rate on the principal balance outstanding for all floating rate loans is indexed to LIBOR and/or an alternate base rate (e.g., prime rate), which typically resets semi-annually, quarterly, or monthly at the borrower's option.

For each of these loans, we have provided the applicable margin over LIBOR or the alternate base rate based on each respective credit agreement and the cash interest rate as of period end. All LIBOR shown above is in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. As of September 30, 2018, the reference rates for the OCSI Glick JV's variable rate loans were the 30-day LIBOR at 2.24%, 60-day LIBOR at 2.29%, the 90-day LIBOR at 2.39%, the 180-day LIBOR at 2.59% and the PRIME at 5.25%.\n(3) Represents the current determination of fair value as of September 30, 2018 utilizing a similar technique as us in accordance with ASC 820.

However, the determination of such fair value is not included in our Board of Directors' valuation process described elsewhere herein.\n(4) This investment is held by both us and the OCSI Glick JV as of September 30, 2017.\n(5) This investment was on cash non-accrual status as of September 30, 2017. Cash non-accrual status is inclusive of PIK and other non-cash income, where applicable.\nThe cost and fair value of our aggregate investment in the OCSI Glick JV was $73.5 million and $58.5 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2018 and $71.3 million and $57.6 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2017. As of September 30, 2018, the Subordinated Notes paid a weighted average interest rate of LIBOR plus 6.5% per annum. As of September 30, 2017, the Subordinated Notes paid a weighted average interest rate of LIBOR plus 8.0% per annum. For the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we earned interest income of $6.1 million, $5.8 million and $5.1 million, respectively, on its investment in the Subordinated Notes, of which $2.2 million, $0.2 million and $0.0 million, respectively, was PIK interest income. The LLC equity interests are dividend producing to the extent there is residual cash to be distributed on a quarterly basis. We did not earn any dividend income for the year ended September 30, 2018 with respect to our investment in the LLC equity interests of the OCSI Glick JV. We reversed $0.6 million of dividend income previously recorded in prior periods during the year ended September 30, 2017 with respect to our LLC equity interests following a determination that such amounts were no longer collectible. We earned dividend income of $2.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2016 with respect to its LLC equity interests.\nBelow is certain summarized financial information for the OCSI Glick JV as of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017 and for the years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017:\n\n\n__________\n(1) There are no management fees or incentive fees charged at the OCSI Glick JV.\nThe OCSI Glick JV has elected to fair value the Subordinated Notes issued to the Company and GF Debt Funding under FASB ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments - Fair Value Options. The Subordinated Notes are valued based on the total assets less the liabilities senior to the Subordinated Notes of the OCSI Glick JV in an amount not exceeding par under the enterprise value technique.\nDuring the years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, we did not sell any debt investments to the OCSI Glick JV.\nDiscussion and Analysis of Results and Operations\nResults of Operations\nThe principal measure of our financial performance is the net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations, which includes net investment income, net realized gain (loss) and net unrealized appreciation (depreciation). Net investment income is the difference between our income from interest, dividends, fees, and other investment income and total expenses. Net realized gain (loss) is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of investment related assets and liabilities and their stated costs. Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) is the net change in the fair value of our investment related assets and liabilities which are carried at fair value during the reporting period, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation (depreciation) when gains or losses are realized.\nComparison of Years Ended September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017\nTotal Investment Income\nTotal investment income includes interest on our investments, fee income and dividend and other income.\nTotal investment income for the years ended September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017 was $47.7 million and $46.6 million, respectively. For the year ended September 30, 2018, this amount primarily consisted of $45.6 million of interest income from portfolio investments (which included $2.2 million of PIK interest) and $2.1 million of fee income. For the year ended September 30, 2017, this amount primarily consisted of $44.9 million of interest income from portfolio investments (which included $0.4 million of PIK interest) and $2.2 million of fee income. The increase of $1.1 million in our total investment income for the year ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the year ended September 30, 2017, was due primarily to a $2.0 million one-time acceleration of interest income in connection with the repayment of our investment in Allen Media LLC and a $0.6 million increase of dividend income, which was primarily attributable to a reversal of dividend income during the year ended September 30, 2017, partially offset by a lower yield on our debt investments.\nExpenses\nNet expenses (expenses net of fee waivers and insurance recoveries) for the year ended September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017 were $27.9 million and $24.2 million, respectively. The increase of $3.7 million in our net expenses for the year ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the year ended September 30, 2017, was primarily due to a $3.6 million increase in interest expense, which was attributable to a $2.0 million write-off of previously unamortized financing costs in connection with the redemption of our $309.0 million debt securitization, or the 2015 Debt Securitization, and increases in LIBOR, a $1.4 million increase in professional fees (net of insurance recoveries) and a $0.4 million increase in administrator expense, partially offset by a $1.0 million decrease in incentive fees on income (net of fee waivers), which was attributable to lower pre-incentive fee net investment income, and a $0.6 million decrease in general and administrative expenses.\nNet Investment Income\nAs a result of the $1.1 million increase in total investment income and the $3.7 million increase in net expenses, net investment income for the year ended September 30, 2018 decreased by approximately $2.7 million, as compared to the year ended September 30, 2017.\nRealized Gain (Loss)\nRealized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the sale or redemption of investments, secured borrowings and foreign currency and the cost basis without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, and includes investments written-off during the period, net of recoveries. Realized losses may also be recorded in connection with our determination that certain investments are considered worthless securities and/or meet the conditions for loss recognition per the applicable tax rules.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2018, we recorded an aggregate net realized loss of $27.7 million primarily in connection with the exit of our investments in Ameritox Ltd. and Metamorph US 3, LLC. During the year ended September 30, 2017, we recorded an aggregate net realized loss of $13.4 million primarily in connection with the exit of our investment in the Answers Corporation.\nSee Note 9. Realized Gains or Losses and Net Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation on Investments\u201d in the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details regarding realized gain (loss) on investments for the years ended September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017.\nNet Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation)\nNet unrealized appreciation or depreciation is the net change in the fair value of our investments, secured borrowings and foreign currency during the reporting period, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation when gains or losses are realized.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2018, we recorded net unrealized appreciation of $28.6 million. For the year ended September 30, 2018, this consisted of $29.0 million of net reclassifications to realized loss (resulting in unrealized appreciation), which was primarily related to the disposal of our investments in Ameritox Ltd. and Metamorph US 3, LLC, and $1.0 million of net unrealized appreciation on equity investments, offset by $1.4 million of net unrealized depreciation on debt investments.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2017, we recorded net unrealized depreciation of $17.8 million. This consisted of $14.1 million of net unrealized depreciation on debt investments and $12.9 million of net unrealized depreciation on equity investments, both of which were primarily related to the write-downs of three of our investments, offset by $9.2 million of net reclassifications to realized loss (resulting in unrealized appreciation), which was primarily in connection with our disposal of our investment in the Answers Corporation.\nComparison of Years Ended September 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016\nTotal Investment Income\nTotal investment income includes interest on our investments, fee income and other investment income.\nTotal investment income for the years ended September 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016 was $46.6 million and $53.4 million, respectively. For the year ended September 30, 2017, this amount primarily consisted of $44.9 million of interest income from portfolio investments (which included $0.4 million of PIK interest) and $2.2 million of fee income. For the year ended September 30, 2016, this amount primarily consisted of $47.6 million of interest income from portfolio investments (which included $0.2 million of PIK interest), $3.1 million of fee income and $2.7 million of dividend income. The decrease of $6.9 million in our total investment income for the year ended September 30, 2017, as compared to the year ended September 30, 2016, was primarily attributable to a lower weighted average annual yield on our debt investments and lower dividend income earned on our investment in OCSI Glick JV. The weighted average annual yield on our debt investments as of September 30, 2017, including the return on the Subordinated Notes, was approximately 7.52%, as compared to 8.58% as of September 30, 2016.\nExpenses\nNet expenses (expenses net of base management fee waivers and insurance recoveries) for the years ended September 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016 were $24.2 million and $28.1 million, respectively. The decrease of $3.9 million in our net expenses for the year ended September 30, 2017, as compared to the year ended September 30, 2016, was primarily due to a $2.9 million decrease in professional fees (net of insurance recoveries) incurred in connection with proxy-related matters, a $2.0 million decrease in incentive fees on income payable to our investment adviser, which was attributable to lower pre-incentive fee net investment income for the year-over-year period, partially offset by a $1.2 million increase in interest expense attributable to higher interest rates in the current year.\nNet Investment Income\nAs a result of the $6.9 million decrease in total investment income, offset by the $3.9 million decrease in net expenses, net investment income for the year ended September 30, 2017 reflected an approximate $2.9 million decrease, as compared to the year ended September 30, 2016.\nRealized Gain (Loss)\nRealized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the sale or redemption of portfolio investments and the cost basis of the investments without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, and includes investments written-off during the period, net of recoveries. Realized losses may also be recorded in connection with our determination that certain investments are considered worthless securities and/or meet the conditions for loss recognition per the applicable tax rules.\nRealized losses on investments and secured borrowings increased from $12.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2016 to $13.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2017. Realized losses for the year ended September 30, 2017 were primarily attributable to the sale of our investment in Answers Corporation. Realized losses for the year ended September 30, 2016 were primarily attributable to the restructuring of our investment in Ameritox Ltd. and the disposition of our investment in B&H Education Inc.\nSee Note 9. Realized Gains or Losses and Net Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation on Investments\u201d in the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details regarding realized gain (loss) on investments and secured borrowings for the years ended September 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016.\nNet Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation)\nNet unrealized appreciation or depreciation is the net change in the fair value of our investments and secured borrowings during the reporting period, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation when gains or losses are realized.\nNet unrealized depreciation on investments and secured borrowings increased from $17.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2016 to $17.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2017. Net unrealized depreciation for the year ended September 30, 2017 was primarily the result of significant write-downs on our investment portfolio, including a $13.6 million write-down on one of our investments. Net unrealized depreciation on investments and secured borrowings for the year ended September 30, 2016 was primarily the result of significant write-downs on our investment portfolio, including $11.9 million of aggregate write-downs on one of our investments and OCSI Glick JV.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have a number of alternatives available to fund our investment portfolio and our operations, including raising equity, increasing or refinancing debt and funding from operational cash flow. We generally expect to fund the growth of our investment portfolio through (i) equity offerings in public or private offerings, which offerings will depend on future market conditions, funding needs and other factors and (ii) additional debt capital (to the extent permissible under the Investment Company Act). In the future, we may also securitize a portion of our investments. To securitize investments, we would likely create a wholly-owned subsidiary and contribute a pool of loans to the subsidiary. We would then sell interests in the subsidiary on a non-recourse basis to purchasers and we would retain all or a portion of the equity in the subsidiary. We cannot assure you, however, that our efforts to grow our portfolio will be successful. For example, our common stock has generally traded at prices below net asset value for the past several years, and we are currently limited in our ability to raise additional equity at prices below the then-current net asset value per share. Additionally, to generate liquidity we may reduce investment size by syndicating a portion of any given transaction. We intend to continue to generate cash primarily from cash flows from operations, including interest earned and future borrowings. We intend to fund our future distribution obligations through operating cash flow or with funds obtained through future equity and debt offerings or credit facilities, as we deem appropriate.\nOur primary uses of funds are investments in our targeted asset classes and cash distributions to holders of our common stock. Following effectiveness of the 150% reduced asset coverage requirements to us on July 11, 2018, over time and under current market conditions, we generally expect to target a debt to equity ratio of 1.20x to 1.60x over the long-term (i.e., one dollar of equity for each $1.20 to $1.60 of debt outstanding).\nFor the year ended September 30, 2018, we experienced a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $25.2 million.

In addition, through the reinvestment period there is a non-usage fee payable of 0.50% per annum on the undrawn amount under the Citibank Facility. As of September 30, 2018, the minimum asset coverage ratio applicable to us under the Citibank Facility is 150% as determined in accordance with the requirements of the Investment Company Act.\nAs of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, we had $110.1 million and $76.5 million outstanding under the Citibank Facility, respectively. Our borrowings under the Citibank Facility bore interest at a weighted average interest rate of 4.264%, 3.559% and 2.838% for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. For the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recorded interest expense of $4.2 million, $4.2 million and $4.1 million, respectively, related to the Citibank Facility.\nEast West Bank Facility\nOn January 6, 2016, we entered into a five-year, $25 million senior secured revolving credit facility with the lenders referenced therein, U.S. Bank National Association, as custodian, and East West Bank as secured lender, or, as amended, the East West Bank Facility. As of September 30, 2018, borrowings under the East West Bank Facility bear an interest rate of either (i) LIBOR plus 2.85% per annum or (ii) East West Bank's prime rate. The East West Bank Facility matures on January 6, 2021. As of September 30, 2018, the minimum\nasset coverage ratio applicable to us under the East West Bank Facility is 150% as determined in accordance with the requirements of the Investment Company Act. The East West Bank Facility requires us to comply with certain affirmative and negative covenants and other customary requirements for similar credit facilities.\nAs of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, we had $8.0 million and $6.5 million of borrowings outstanding under the East West Bank Facility, respectively. Our borrowings under the East West Bank Facility bore interest at a weighted average interest rate of 4.949% and 4.633% for the years ended September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, respectively.

The period during which OCSI Senior Funding Ltd. may request drawdowns under the Deutsche Bank Facility (the revolving period\u201d) will continue through March 24, 2019 unless there is an earlier termination or event of default. The Deutsche Bank Facility will mature on the earliest of six months from the termination of the revolving period, the occurrence of an event of default or completion of a securitization transaction.\nPrior to the end of the revolving period, borrowings under the Deutsche Bank Facility will bear interest at a rate equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 1.90%, following which the interest rate will reset to three-month LIBOR plus 2.05% for the remaining term of the Deutsche Bank Facility. No up-front commitment fees were paid by us in connection with the Deutsche Bank Facility.

OCSI Senior Funding Ltd. has made customary representations and warranties and is required to comply with various affirmative and negative covenants, reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar credit facilities. Our borrowings, including indirectly under the Deutsche Bank Facility, are subject to the leverage restrictions contained in the Investment Company Act.\nAs of September 30, 2018, we had $157.0 million outstanding under the Deutsche Bank Facility. For the period from September 24, 2018 to September 30, 2018, our borrowings under the Deutsche Bank Facility bore interest at a weighted average interest rate of 4.266%, and we recorded interest expense of $0.1 million.\nDebt Securitization\nIn connection with entry into the Deutsche Bank Facility, on September 24, 2018, FS Senior Funding Ltd. and FS Senior Funding CLO LLC redeemed all outstanding senior secured notes issued in the 2015 Debt Securitization pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the senior secured notes and the revocable notice issued by us on August 14, 2018. Following such redemption, the agreements governing the 2015 Debt Securitization were terminated and FS Senior Funding Ltd. was merged with and into OCSI Senior Funding Ltd. with OCSI Senior Funding Ltd. continuing as the surviving entity. The senior secured notes would have otherwise matured on May 28, 2025. We expensed $2.0 million of previously unamortized financing costs in connection with the redemption of the 2015 Debt Securitization.\nPrior to September 24, 2018, the 2015 Debt Securitization consisted of $126.0 million Class A-T Senior Secured 2015 Notes which bore interest at three-month LIBOR plus 1.80%; $29.0 million Class A-S Senior Secured 2015 Notes which bore interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 1.55%, until a step-up in spread to 2.10% occurred in October 2016; $20.0 million Class A-R Senior Secured Revolving 2015 Notes which bore interest at a rate of commercial paper, or CP, plus 1.80%, or, collectively, the Class A 2015 Notes; and $25.0 million Class B Senior Secured 2015 Notes which bore interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 2.65% per annum, which were issued in a private placement. Prior to September 24, 2018, we retained the entire $22.6 million of Class C Senior Secured 2015 Notes (which we purchased at 98.0% of par value) and the entire $86.4 million of Subordinated 2015 Notes.\nFor the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the components of interest expense, cash paid for interest, average interest rates and average outstanding balances for the 2015 Debt Securitization were as follows:\n\nThe classes, interest rates, spread over LIBOR, cash paid for interest and stated interest expense of each of the Class A-T, Class A-S, Class A-R, Class B and Class C Senior Secured 2015 Notes for the years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 are as follows:\n\n_______________________\n(1) Spread increased to 2.10% in October 2016 from 1.55%.\n(2) Interest expense includes 1.0% undrawn fee.\n(3) We held all Class C 2015 Senior Secured Notes outstanding and thus have not recorded any related interest expense as they were eliminated in consolidation.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe may be a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. As of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, our only off-balance sheet arrangements consisted of $22.8 million and $43.5 million, respectively, of unfunded commitments to provide debt and equity financing to certain of our portfolio companies. Such commitments are subject to our portfolio companies' satisfaction of certain financial and nonfinancial covenants and may involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.\nA list of unfunded commitments by investment (consisting of revolvers, term loans with delayed draw components and Subordinated Notes and LLC equity interests of the OCSI Glick JV) as of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017 is shown in the table below:\n\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table reflects information pertaining to our debt outstanding under the Citibank Facility, the East West Bank Facility, the Deutsche Bank Facility and the 2015 Debt Securitization:\n\nThe following table reflects our contractual obligations arising from the Citibank Facility, Deutsche Bank Facility and East West Bank Facility:\n\nRegulated Investment Company Status and Distributions\nWe have qualified and elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code for tax purposes. As long as we continue to qualify as a RIC, we will not be subject to tax on our investment company taxable income (determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid) or realized net capital gains, to the extent that such taxable income or gains is distributed, or deemed to be distributed as dividends, to stockholders on a timely basis.\nTaxable income generally differs from net income for financial reporting purposes due to temporary and permanent differences in the recognition of income and expenses, and generally excludes net unrealized appreciation or depreciation. Distributions declared and paid by us in a taxable year may differ from taxable income for that taxable year as such distributions may include the distribution of taxable\nincome derived from the current taxable year or the distribution of taxable income derived from the prior taxable year carried forward into and distributed in the current taxable year. Distributions also may include returns of capital.\nTo maintain RIC tax treatment, we must, among other things, distribute dividends, with respect to each taxable year, of an amount at least equal to 90% of our investment company taxable income (i.e., our net ordinary income and our realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any) determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid. As a RIC, we are also subject to a federal excise tax, based on distribution requirements of our taxable income on a calendar year basis. We anticipate timely distribution of our taxable income in accordance with tax rules. We did not incur a U.S. federal excise tax for calendar years 2016 and 2017 and do not expect to incur a U.S. federal excise tax for the calendar year 2018. We may incur a federal excise tax in future years.\nWe intend to distribute at least 90% of our annual taxable income (which includes our taxable interest and fee income) to our stockholders. The covenants under the respective documents governing the Citibank Facility, the East West Bank Facility and the Deutsche Bank Facility could, under certain circumstances, hinder our ability to satisfy the distribution requirement associated with our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC. In addition, we may retain for investment some or all of our net capital gains (i.e., realized net long-term capital gains in excess of realized net short-term capital losses) and treat such amounts as deemed distributions to our stockholders. If we do this, our stockholders will be treated as if they received actual distributions of the capital gains we retained and then reinvested the net after-tax proceeds in our common stock. Our stockholders also may be eligible to claim tax credits (or, in certain circumstances, tax refunds) equal to their allocable share of the tax we paid on the capital gains deemed distributed to them. To the extent our taxable earnings for a fiscal and taxable year fall below the total amount of our distributions for that fiscal and taxable year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our stockholders.\nWe may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time. In addition, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions due to the asset coverage test for borrowings applicable to us as a Business Development Company under the Investment Company Act and due to provisions in our credit facilities and debt instruments. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our taxable income annually, we will suffer adverse tax consequences, including possible loss of our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions or distributions at a particular level.\nA RIC may treat a distribution of its own stock as fulfilling its RIC distribution requirements if each stockholder elects to receive his or her entire distribution in either cash or stock of the RIC, subject to certain limitations regarding the aggregate amount of cash to be distributed to all stockholders. If these and certain other requirements are met, for U.S federal income tax purposes, the amount of the dividend paid in stock will be equal to the amount of cash that could have been received instead of stock. We have no current intention of paying dividends in shares of our stock in accordance with these guidelines.\nWe may generate qualified net interest income or qualified net short-term capital gains that may be exempt from U.S. withholding tax when distributed to foreign stockholders. A RIC is permitted to designate distributions of qualified net interest income and qualified short-term capital gains as exempt from U.S. withholding tax when paid to non-U.S. shareholders with proper documentation. The following table, which may be subject to change as we finalize our annual tax filings, lists the percentage of qualified net interest income and qualified short-term capital gains for the year ended September 30, 2018, our last tax year end. \nWe have adopted a DRIP that provides for the reinvestment of any distributions that we declare in cash on behalf of our stockholders, unless a stockholder elects to receive cash. As a result, if our Board of Directors declares a cash distribution, then our stockholders who have not opted out\u201d of the DRIP will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, rather than receiving a cash distribution. If our shares are trading at a premium to net asset value, we typically issue new shares to implement the DRIP, with such shares issued at the greater of the most recently computed net asset value per share of our common stock or 95% of the current market value per share of our common stock on the payment date for such distribution. If our shares are trading at a discount to net asset value, we typically purchase shares in the open market in connection with our obligations under the DRIP.\nRelated Party Transactions\nWe have entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with Oaktree and the Administration Agreement with Oaktree Administrator, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Oaktree. Mr. John B. Frank, an interested member of our Board of Directors, has an indirect pecuniary interest in Oaktree. Oaktree is a registered investment adviser under the Advisers Act that is partially and indirectly owned by OCG. See Note 11. Related Party Transactions - Investment Advisory Agreement\u201d and - Administrative Services\u201d in the notes to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPrior to October 17, 2017, we were externally managed and advised by our Former Adviser, and our administrator was FSC CT LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of our Former Adviser. Messrs. Bernard D. Berman, Patrick J. Dalton, Ivelin M. Dimitrov, Alexander C.\nFrank and Todd G. Owens, each an interested member of our Board of Directors for all or a portion of our fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 and prior to October 17, 2017, had a direct or indirect pecuniary interest in our Former Adviser.\nWe served as collateral manager to FS Senior Funding Ltd. under a collateral management agreement in connection with the 2015 Debt Securitization and were entitled to receive a fee for providing these services. We retained a sub-collateral manager, which was Oaktree from October 17, 2017 to September 24, 2018, to provide collateral management sub-advisory services to us pursuant to a sub-collateral management agreement. The sub-collateral manager was entitled to receive 100% of the collateral management fees paid to us under the collateral management agreement, but Oaktree irrevocably waived its right to such sub-collateral management fees in respect of the 2015 Debt Securitization.\nRecent Developments\nDistribution Declaration\nOn November 19, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly distribution of $0.155 per share, payable on December 28, 2018 to stockholders of record on December 17, 2018.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nSee Note 2.

financial status, as reflected in the financial statements and based on the management's point of view. For this particular report:\n\n1. Investment Income:\n- Total investment income for the year ended September 30, 2018, was $47.7 million, slightly higher than the previous year's $46.6 million, primarily due to a one-time acceleration of interest income and increased dividend income.\n\n2. Expenses:\n- Total net expenses increased by $3.7 million year over year, mainly due to increased interest expense, professional fees (net of insurance recoveries), and administration expenses, partially offset by decreased incentive fees and general and administrative costs.\n\n3. Investment Activity:\n- The company invested in and funded a total of $455.0 million, while it received $464.3 million in principal payments and proceeds from the sale of investments.\n- Unfunded commitments totaled $22.8 million as of September 30, 2018.\n\n4. Indebtedness:\n- Borrowings amounted to $275.1 million under various credit facilities and the Debt Securitization, the latter of which was redeemed on September 24, 2018.\n\n5. Distributions:\n- The company declared and paid a quarterly distribution of $0.155 per share in November 2018.\n\n6. Management of Investments:\n- The company is externally managed by Oaktree, which has implemented a strategy of repositioning the portfolio by rotating out challenging investments, increasing core private investments, and adding selectively to the portfolio.\n\n7. Financial Instruments:\n- The report lists various financial instruments and commitments, including credit facilities, a debt securitization (which was redeemed), and unfunded commitments to provide financing.\n\n8. Tax Status:\n- Oaktree Capital Senior Corporation (OCSI) is a RIC and must distribute at least 90% of its taxable income to maintain its RIC status.\n\n9. Forward-Looking Statements:\n- The report includes statements about future events and expectations which are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ due to factors such as changes in the economy, financial markets, political environment, and laws or regulations.\n\n10. Business Environment:\n- The shift of commercial banks away from middle-market lending has created opportunities for non-bank lenders like OCSI, as middle-market companies often represent a significant portion of private sector GDP and employment.\n\n11. Portfolio Composition:\n- Portfolio investments are primarily in senior loans to a variety of industries, with a majority of the investments being first-lien floating rate senior secured loans.\n\n12. Critical Accounting Policies:\n- Investments are valued using the fair value hierarchy, which includes Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 inputs.\n- Revenue recognition policies include accrual basis accounting for interest and dividend income, recognizing fee income as earned, and PIK interest recorded when expected to be collected.\n\n13. OCSI Glick JV:\n- OCSI has a joint venture that invests in senior secured loans, with total assets of $166.2 million as of September 30, 2018.\n\n14. Related Party Transactions:\n- OCSI has entered into agreements with Oaktree and Oaktree Administrator for management and administration services.\n\n15. Recent Accounting Standards:\n- The report briefly discusses the adoption of new accounting standards and their anticipated impact.\n\n16. Changes and Developments:\n- The report may include any significant changes or developments since the end of the last fiscal year or that are expected to occur in the future."}
