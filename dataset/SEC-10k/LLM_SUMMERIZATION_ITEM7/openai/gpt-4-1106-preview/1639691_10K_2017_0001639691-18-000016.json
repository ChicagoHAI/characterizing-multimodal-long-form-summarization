Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis together with Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the matters set forth in Cautionary Statement About Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as of and for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the transitional period April 25, 2015 to December 31, 2015 and the fiscal year ended April 24, 2015.\nDescription of the Business\nWe are a global medical device company focused on the development and delivery of important therapeutic solutions for the benefit of patients, healthcare professionals and healthcare systems throughout the world. Working closely with medical professionals in the fields of Cardiac Surgery and Neuromodulation, we design, develop, manufacture and sell innovative therapeutic solutions that are consistent with our mission to improve our patients' quality of life, increase the skills and capabilities of healthcare professionals and minimize healthcare costs.\nSale of the CRM Business Franchise\nOn November 20, 2017, we entered the LOI to sell CRM to MicroPort Scientific Corporation for $190 million in cash. The results of operations of CRM are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Refer to the Discontinued Operations discussion below and to Note 4. Discontinued Operations to the Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBackground and the Mergers\nHeadquartered in London, LivaNova PLC (collectively with its subsidiaries, the Company\u201d, LivaNova\u201d, we\u201d or our\u201d) was organized under the laws of England and Wales on February 20, 2015 for the purpose of facilitating the business combination of Cyberonics, Inc., a Delaware corporation ( Cyberonics\u201d) and Sorin S.p.A., a joint stock company organized under the laws of Italy ( Sorin\u201d). As a result of the business combination, we became the holding company of the combined businesses of Cyberonics and Sorin. This business combination (the Mergers\u201d) became effective on October 19, 2015, at which time our shares were listed for trading on the NASDAQ Global Market ( NASDAQ\u201d) and on the London Stock Exchange (the LSE\u201d) as a standard listing under the trading symbol LIVN.\u201d Upon the consummation of the Mergers, the historical financial statements of Cyberonics became the Company's historical financial statements. Accordingly, the historical financial statements of Cyberonics are included in the comparative prior periods. For further information regarding the acquisition, refer to Note 3. Business Combinations\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBusiness Franchises\nLivaNova is comprised of two principal Business Franchises: Cardiac Surgery and Neuromodulation, corresponding to our main therapeutic areas. Corporate activities include corporate business development and New Ventures. New Ventures is focused on new growth platforms and identification of other opportunities for expansion.\nCardiac Surgery Update\nOur Cardiac Surgery Business Franchise ( CS\u201d) is engaged in the development, production and sale of cardiac surgery products, including oxygenators, heart-lung machines, perfusion tubing systems, cannulae and other accessories used for extracorporeal circulation, systems for autologous blood transfusion and blood washing, as well as a complete line of surgical tissue and mechanical heart valve replacements and repair products.\nResearch and Development updates\nIn October 2015, we announced the initiation of PERSIST-AVR, the first international, prospective post-market randomized multi-center clinical study evaluating the Perceval sutureless aortic valve compared to standard sutured bioprostheses in patients with aortic valve disease. The Perceval valve, the only sutureless biological aortic valve replacement ( AVR\u201d) on the market today, employs a unique self-anchoring frame that enables the surgeon to replace the diseased valve without suturing it into place. The study is expected to enroll 1,234 patients within a two-year enrollment period and patients will be followed until five years post procedure. In January 2017, the independent study, Aortic Valve Replacement With Sutureless Perceval Bioprosthesis: Single-Center Experience With 617 Implants,\u201d was presented to The Society of Thoracic Surgeons. The study found AVR procedures conducted with the Perceval sutureless valve resulted in low mortality and excellent hemodynamic performance for patients.\nCardiopulmonary product updates\nIn September 2017, we received FDA 510(k) clearance for the U.S. market launch of our Optiflow Arterial Cannulae Family. Optiflow aortic arch cannulae provide improved hydrodynamics with a novel dispersive tip design that improves blood flow characteristics resulting in reduced wall shear stress ( WSS\u201d) profiles. Optiflow Arterial cannulae feature a unique basket tip with large openings that allow a more physiologically compatible dispersive design. This design has been shown to significantly reduce WSS and turbulence, thereby improving hydrodynamics and potentially reducing ischemic complications from extracorporeal circulation during cardiac surgery.\nFDA Warning Letter\nOn December 29, 2015, the FDA issued a Warning Letter (the Warning Letter\u201d) alleging certain violations of FDA regulations applicable to medical device manufacturers at our Munich, Germany and Arvada, Colorado facilities. Among other things, the Warning Letter stated that our 3T devices and other devices we manufactured at our Munich facility are subject to refusal of admission into the U.S. until resolution of the issues set forth by the FDA in the Warning Letter. The FDA has informed us that the import alert is limited to the 3T devices, but that the agency reserves the right to expand the scope of the import alert if future circumstances warrant such action. The Warning Letter did not request that existing users cease using the 3T device, and manufacturing and shipment of all of our products other than the 3T device remain unaffected by the import limitation. To help clarify these issues for current customers, we issued an informational Customer Letter in January 2016, and that same month agreed with the FDA on a process for shipping 3T devices to existing U.S. users pursuant to a certificate of medical necessity program. We continue to work diligently to remediate the FDA's inspectional observations for the Munich facility, as well as the additional issues identified in the Warning Letter. For further information, please refer to Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCDC and FDA Safety Communications and Company Field Safety Notice Update\nOn October 13, 2016 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC\u201d) and FDA separately released safety notifications regarding the 3T devices. The CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report ( MMWR\u201d) and Health Advisory Notice ( HAN\u201d) reported that tests conducted by CDC and its affiliates indicate that there appears to be genetic similarity between both patient and 3T device strains of the non-tuberculous mycobacterium ( NTM\u201d) bacteria M. chimaera isolated in hospitals in Iowa and Pennsylvania. Citing the geographic separation between the two hospitals referenced in the investigation, the report asserts that 3T devices manufactured prior to August 18, 2014 could have been contaminated during the manufacturing process. The CDC's HAN and FDA's Safety Communication, issued contemporaneously with the MMWR report, each assess certain risks associated with 3T devices and provide guidance for providers and patients. On October 13, 2016, we issued a Field Safety Notice Update for U.S. users of 3T devices to proactively and voluntarily contact facilities to aid in implementation of the CDC and FDA recommendations. For further information, please refer to Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nProduct Remediation Plan\nIn response to the Warning Letter and CDC's HAN and FDA's Safety Commission, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we initiated a program to provide existing 3T device users with a new loaner 3T device at no charge pending regulatory approval and implementation of additional risk mitigation strategies worldwide. This loaner program began in the U.S. and is being made available progressively on a global basis, prioritizing and allocating devices to 3T device users based on pre-established criteria. We anticipate that this program will continue until we are able to address customer needs through a broader solution that includes implementation of one or more of the risk mitigation strategies currently under review with regulatory agencies. We are also currently implementing a vacuum and sealing upgrade program in as many countries as possible throughout 2018 and beyond until all devices are upgraded. Furthermore, we intend to perform a no-charge deep disinfection service for 3T device users who have reported confirmed M. chimaera mycobacterium contamination. Although the deep disinfection service is not yet available in the U.S., it is currently offered in many countries around the world and will be expanded to additional geographies as we receive the required regulatory approvals.\nOn December 31, 2016, we recognized a liability for our product remediation plan related to our 3T device. We concluded that it was probable that a liability had been incurred upon management's approval of the plan and the commitments made by management to various regulatory authorities globally in November and December 2016, and furthermore, the cost associated with the plan was reasonably estimable. At December 31, 2017, the product remediation liability was $27.5 million. Refer to Note 6. Product Remediation Liability\u201d for additional information.\nHeart Valve product updates\nIn January 2016, we announced FDA approval of the Perceval sutureless valve. While we have been selling Perceval in other parts of the world for several years, we began commercial distribution of the device in the United States last year, with the first\nimplant announced on March 8, 2016. The Perceval valve has been implanted in more than 25,000 patients in more than 310 hospitals in 34 countries across the world.\nIn early February 2016, we announced that we received FDA approval of our CROWN PRT valve for the treatment of aortic valve disease. The CROWN PRT valve uses a stented aortic bioprosthesis technology and features a surgeon-friendly design, with optimized hemodynamics and a patented phospholipid reduction treatment ( PRT\u201d), designed to enhance valve durability. We launched the CROWN PRT valve in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016.\nSale of our Suzhou Industrial Park facility in Shanghai, China\nIn March 2017, we committed to a plan to sell our Suzhou Industrial Park facility in Shanghai, China, an emerging market greenfield project for the local manufacture of Cardiopulmonary disposable products in Suzhou Industrial Park in China. As a result of this exit plan, we recorded an impairment of the building and equipment of $5.4 million and accrued $0.5 million of additional costs, primarily related to employee severance, during the year ended December 31, 2017, included in \u2018Restructuring expenses' in the consolidated statement of (loss) income. In addition, the land, building and equipment were recorded as Assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet, with a carrying value of $13.6 million as of December 31, 2017. In December, 2017, we executed a letter of intent for the sale of the Suzhou facility.\nNeuromodulation Update\nThe Neuromodulation segment designs, develops and markets neuromodulation therapy for the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy and treatment resistant depression. Through this segment, we market our proprietary implantable VNS Therapy\u00ae Systems that deliver vagus nerve stimulation therapy for the treatment of epilepsy and depression.\nResearch and Development updates\nOur product development efforts are directed toward improving the VNS Therapy System and developing new products that provide additional features and functionality. We are conducting ongoing product development activities to enhance the VNS Therapy System pulse generator, lead and programming software. We support studies for our product development efforts and to build clinical evidence for the VNS Therapy System. We will be required to obtain appropriate U.S. and international regulatory approvals, and clinical studies may be a prerequisite to regulatory approvals for some products. Our research and development ( R&D\u201d) efforts will require significant funding to complete and may not be successful. Even if successful, additional clinical studies may be needed to achieve regulatory approval and to commercialize any or all new or improved products. Several development projects were either terminated or halted during year ended December 31, 2016. We made the decision to focus our efforts on projects we believe have a strong likelihood of meeting both patient and physician needs in the near term.\nProduct updates\nEpilepsy\nIn October 2017, we obtained FDA approval to market our SenTiva VNS Therapy System, which consists of the SenTiva implantable generator and the next-generation VNS Therapy Programming System. SenTiva is the smallest and lightest responsive therapy for epilepsy. The new VNS Therapy Programming System features a wireless wand and new user interface on a small tablet. Together, these components offer patients with drug-resistant epilepsy a physician-directed, customizable therapy with smart technology that reduces the number of seizures, lessens the duration of seizures and enables a faster recovery.\nIn June 2017, the FDA approved our VNS Therapy device for use in patients who are at least four years of age and have partial onset seizures that are refractory to antiepileptic medications. VNS Therapy is the first and only FDA-approved device for drug-resistant epilepsy in this pediatric population. Previously, VNS Therapy was approved by the FDA for patients 12 years or older.\nIn addition, in June 2017, we received FDA approval, and in August 2017, we received CE Mark approval, for our VNS Therapy device for expanded magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI\u201d) labeling affirming VNS Therapy as the only epilepsy device approved by the FDA for MRI scans. Currently, SenTiva, AspireHC and AspireSR models of VNS Therapy technology provide for this expanded MRI access.\nDepression\nIn March 2017, the American Journal of Psychiatry published the results of the longest and largest naturalistic study on effective treatments for patients experiencing chronic and severe depression. The findings showed that the addition of VNS Therapy to traditional treatment methods is effective in reducing symptoms in patients with treatment-resistant depression.\nCosta Rica Manufacturing plant closure\nIn October 2016, management initiated a plan to exit the Costa Rica manufacturing operations and transfer those activities to Houston, Texas. We recorded an impairment of the building and equipment of $5.7 million in fiscal year 2016, which was included in \u2018Restructuring expenses' in the consolidated statement of (loss) income. In addition, the carrying value of $4.5 million for the land and building after impairment was reclassified as Assets held for sale and were included in \u2018Other current assets' in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016. We completed the sale of the Costa Rica facility during the year ended December 31, 2017 and received $4.9 million in proceeds from the sale.\nCorporate Activities and New Ventures\nCorporate activities include shared services for finance, legal, human resources and information technology, corporate business development and New Ventures. New Ventures is focused on new growth platforms and identification of other opportunities for expansion.\nHeart failure\nWith respect to heart failure, New Ventures is focused on the development and clinical testing of the VITARIA System for treating heart failure through vagus nerve stimulation.\nWe received CE Mark approval of the VITARIA System in February 2015 for patients who have moderate to severe heart failure (New York Heart Association Class II/III) with left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction < 40%) and who remain symptomatic despite stable, optimal heart failure drug therapy. The VITARIA System provides a specific method of VNS called autonomic regulation therapy ( ART\u201d), and it includes the same elements as the VNS Therapy System. We conducted a pilot study, ANTHEM-HF, outside the United States, which concluded in 2014. The study results support the safety and efficacy of ART delivered by the VITARIA System. The VITARIA System is not approved in the U.S. During 2014, we also initiated a second pilot study, ANTHEM-HFpEF, to study ART in patients experiencing symptomatic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. This pilot study is currently underway outside the United States.\nSleep Apnea\nIn October 2014, Sorin invested $20.0 million in Respicardia, a U.S.-based developer of implantable therapies designed to improve Respiratory Rhythm Management and cardiovascular health. Respicardia's remed\u0113\u00ae System is an implantable device system designed to restore a more natural breathing pattern during sleep in patients with central sleep apnea (CSA) by transvenously stimulating the phrenic nerve. The remed\u0113 System received CE Mark certification in 2010 and in October 2017, Respicardia received U.S. FDA market approval. In September 2016, we elected not to exercise our option to purchase the outstanding shares of Respicardia as the investment no longer met our objective for substantial ongoing involvement taken into consideration with our overall portfolio management program. As a result, in September 2016 we recorded an impairment of $9.2 million equal to the amount of the carrying value of the option. In addition, we terminated our exclusive distribution agreement with Respicardia in November 2016. In December 2017, certain factors, including an additional round of external financing with a new investor, indicated that the carrying value of our investment might not be recoverable and the decrease in value of our investment was other than temporary. Our estimate of the fair value of our investment using the income approach resulted below our carrying value and as a result, we recorded an additional impairment of $5.5 million. This impairment was recorded in \u2018Impairment of cost-method investments' in our consolidated statement of (loss) income.\nWe have invested in ImThera Medical, Inc. ( ImThera\u201d), a privately held, emerging-growth company developing an implantable neurostimulation device system for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA\u201d) since 2011. On January 16, 2018 we acquired the remaining 86% outstanding interests in ImThera for up to approximately $225 million. Up-front costs are approximately $78 million with the balance paid on a schedule driven by regulatory and sales milestones. Headquartered in San Diego, California, ImThera manufactures an implantable device that stimulates multiple tongue muscles via the hypoglossal nerve, which opens the airway while a patient is sleeping. The ImThera device is highly aligned with our Neuromodulation Business Franchise. ImThera has a commercial presence in the European market, while we will be advancing ImThera's enrollment in an FDA pivotal study. We expect to submit pivotal trial results to the FDA towards the end of 2019 or in early 2020.\nMitral Valve Regurgitation\nMitral regurgitation ( MR\u201d) occurs when the heart's mitral valve does not close tightly, which allows blood to flow backwards in the heart. This reduces the amount of blood that flows to the rest of the body, making the patient feel tired or out of breath. Treatment depends on the nature and the severity of MR. In certain cases, heart surgery may be needed to repair or replace the valve. Left untreated, severe MR can cause heart failure or heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias).\nCaisson Interventional, LLC ( Caisson\u201d) is a clinical-stage medical device company based in Maple Grove, Minnesota and is focused on the design, development and clinical evaluation of a novel transcatheter mitral valve replacement ( TMVR\u201d) implant device with a fully transvenous delivery system for the treatment of mitral regurgitation. On May 2, 2017, we acquired the remaining 51% outstanding equity interests in Caisson for a purchase price of up to $72.0 million, in support of our strategic growth initiatives. As a result of our acquisition of Caisson, we began consolidating the results of Caisson as of May 2, 2017. In April 2016, Caisson obtained FDA approval of an Investigational Device Exemption study using its technology for treating mitral regurgitation heart failure with transcatheter mitral valve replacement and we are currently executing against a defined clinical data development plan designed to enable commercialization of the Caisson technology.\nWe are also invested in two mitral valve startups. Cardiosolutions Inc. ( Cardiosolutions\u201d) and Highlife S.A.S. ( Highlife\u201d). Cardiosolutions, a startup headquartered in the U.S. in which we have held an interest since 2012, is developing an innovative spacer technology for treating mitral regurgitation. Highlife, headquartered in France, is focused on developing devices for treating mitral regurgitation through percutaneous replacement of the native mitral valve. We recognized an impairment of our equity method investment in, and notes receivable from, Highlife during the year ended December 31, 2017, due to certain factors including a revision in our investment strategy that indicated that the carrying value of our aggregate investment might not be recoverable and that the decrease in value of our aggregate investment was other than temporary. We, therefore, estimated the fair value of our investment and notes receivable using the market approach and recorded an aggregate impairment of $13.0 million.\nResults of Continuing Operations\nThe merger of Cyberonics and Sorin on October 19, 2015 was considered a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting, with Cyberonics considered the acquirer of Sorin. As a result, Sorin's assets and liabilities were combined at their estimated fair values. In addition, LivaNova became the holding company of the combined businesses of Cyberonics and Sorin and the successor\u201d company to Cyberonics for accounting and Exchange Act reporting purposes.\nUnderstanding Our Financial Information\nIn this Annual Report on Form 10-K, LivaNova, as the successor company to Cyberonics, is reporting (in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States) the results for:\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>LivaNova and its consolidated subsidiaries for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>A transitional period, April 25, 2015 to December 31, 2015, filed on Form 10-K/T. This transitional report is the result of the change from Cyberonics' fiscal year ending the last Friday in April before the Mergers to a calendar year ending December 31st after the Mergers. The transitional period included the business activities of Cyberonics and its consolidated subsidiaries for the period April 25, 2015 to October 18, 2015, and the consolidated results of the combined businesses of LivaNova (Cyberonics and Sorin) for the period October 19, 2015 to December 31, 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>LivaNova is also reporting the historical results of Cyberonics and its consolidated subsidiaries for the fiscal year ended April 24, 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The transitional period, April 25, 2015 to December 31, 2015, as described above, impacts the comparability of the revenues, cost of sales and expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, and as such, we have provided an unaudited equivalent prior period consisting of business activity for the period January 24, 2015 to December 31, 2015. The unaudited equivalent prior period included the transitional period April 25, 2015 to December 31, 2015, and the unaudited Cyberonics fourth quarter data from the fiscal year ended April 24, 2015, or January 24, 2015 to April 24, 2015. The equivalent prior period has 18 fewer working days than the year ended December 31, 2016 and 17 working days fewer than the year ended December 31, 2017.\nIn addition, amortization expense of $7.7 million and $1.0 million for the transitional period April 25, 2015 to December 31, 2015, and the prior fiscal year ended April 24, 2015, respectively, was reclassified on the consolidated statements of income (loss) in order to conform with the presentation for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.

Cardiopulmonary product sales increased year over year due to continued progress towards upgrading customers from our S3 heart-lung machines to our current S5 device, strong sales of our Inspire oxygenator and favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Heart valve sales increased by $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, due to favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which more than offset continuing global declines in traditional tissue and mechanical heart valves.\nCardiac Surgery operating income increased by $64.4 million or the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily driven by increased sales of $23.8 million combined with inventory fair value step-up amortization of $25.2 million that was recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The inventory fair value step-up was fully amortized by September 30, 2016.\nCardiac Surgery net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the equivalent prior period January 24, 2015 to December 31, 2015 increased by 314.3% because sales in the prior equivalent period were limited to the period October 19, 2015 (acquisition date for the Mergers) through December 31, 2015. Additionally, Cardiac Surgery operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the equivalent prior period January 24, 2015 to December 31, 2015 increased by 26.6% due to the acquisition date for the Mergers.\nNeuromodulation\nNeuromodulation net sales increased $23.6 million, or 6.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the prior year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to strong demand for the AspireSR VNS Therapy System and the launch of the SenTiva VNS Therapy System in October 2017.\nThe increase in Neuromodulation operating income for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior-year period, was primarily driven by increased operating leverage as a result of higher net sales, partially offset by the increased costs associated with sales force expansion and marketing efforts in the U.S.\nNeuromodulation net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $62.6 million, or 21.7%, as compared to the equivalent prior period January 24, 2015 to December 31, 2015, due primarily to pricing increases in the U.S. and to 17 fewer working days in the equivalent prior period.\nNeuromodulation operating income increased $61.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the equivalent prior period January 24, 2015 to December 31, 2015, due primarily to reporting corporate and intangible amortization expense for Cyberonics prior to the Mergers as Neuromodulation Business Franchise expenses rather than as \u2018Other' expenses.\nCost of Sales and Expenses\nThe table below illustrates our cost of sales and major expenses as a percentage of net sales:\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Equivalent Prior Period January 24, 2015 to December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Unaudited)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product remediation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Merger and integration expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangibles\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales consisted primarily of direct labor, allocated manufacturing overhead, the acquisition cost of raw materials and components.\nCost of sales as a percentage of net sales was 34.9% for the year ended December 31, 2017; a decrease of 3.2% as compared to the prior year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was due to the decrease in amortization of inventory written-up in the Mergers related to the Cardiac Surgery Segment of $25.2 million, which accounted for 2.6% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nCost of sales as a percentage of net sales was 38.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016; an increase of 10.4% as compared to the equivalent period ended December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily due to the inclusion of Sorin's Cardiac Surgery Business Franchise activities for the full year in 2016 as compared to its inclusion in the prior equivalent period for October 19, 2015 (acquisition date for the Mergers) through December 31, 2015.\nSelling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d) Expenses\nSG&A expenses are comprised of sales, marketing, general and administrative activities. SG&A expenses exclude expenses incurred in connection with the merger between Cyberonics and Sorin, integration costs after the Mergers and restructuring costs under the Restructuring Plans initiated after the Mergers.\nSG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 0.6% to 37.6% as compared to the prior year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was largely attributable to litigation related to our 3T devices, costs associated with acquisitions and other legal matters.\nSG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased 3.4% to 37.0% as compared to the equivalent prior period ended December 31, 2015. This reduction was due to our integration and re-organization efforts that capitalized on synergies between Cyberonics and Sorin's Cardiac Surgery segment.\nResearch and Development ( R&D\u201d) Expenses\nR&D expenses consist of product design and development efforts, clinical study programs and regulatory activities, which are essential to the Company's strategic portfolio initiatives, including TMVR, Treatment Resistant Depression and Heart Failure.\nR&D expenses as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by 2.3% to 10.8% as compared to the prior year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Caisson in May 2017, inclusive of $5.8 million in post-combination compensation expense recognized concurrent with the acquisition of Caisson, and $7.2 million in compensation expense associated with the retention of the employees of Caisson. The additional increase as compared to the prior year was due to increased investment in clinical and registries pertaining to TMVR and Heart Failure.\nR&D expenses as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased by 3.5% to 8.5% as compared to the prior equivalent period ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily due to completion of work, adaption to longer developmental schedules or cancellation of work in 2016.\nMerger and Integration Expenses\nMerger and integration expenses consisted primarily of consulting costs associated with computer systems integration efforts, organization structure integration, synergy and tax planning, as well as the integration of internal controls for the two legacy organizations. In addition, integration expenses include retention bonuses, branding and renaming efforts and lease cancellation penalties in Milan and Brussels.\nMerger and integration expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 1.5% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared 2.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016, and 14.7% for the equivalent period ended December 31, 2015, due to the continued decline in integration activities associated with the Mergers.\nRestructuring Expenses\nOur restructuring plans (the Plans\u201d) leverage economies of scale, eliminate duplicate corporate expenses and streamline distributions, logistics and office functions in order to reduce overall costs. Restructuring expenses are detailed in Note 5. Restructuring Plans\u201d in the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our 2015 and 2016 Reorganization Plans (the Plans\u201d) were initiated October 2015 and March 2016, respectively, in conjunction with the completion of the Mergers. The Plans included the Costa Rica manufacturing operation exit plan, initiated in December 2016 and completed during 2017, and the Suzhou, China exit plan, initiated in March 2017.\nRestructuring expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 1.7% from 3.9% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 as our restructuring activities declined and continue to decline. For the equivalent period ended December 31, 2015, restructuring expenses were 2.4% as a percentage of net sales.\nAmortization of Intangibles\nAmortization of intangibles includes the amortization of finite-lived intangible assets, primarily intellectual property and customer relationships, acquired at fair value in the Mergers in October 2015. Amortization of intangibles does not include amortization of the step-up of inventory to fair value at the Mergers, which was reported as a component of cost of sales. Prior to the Mergers, Cyberonics' intangible asset amortization was primarily related to intellectual property utilized in R&D activities.\nInterest Expense\nWe incurred interest expense of $7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due a reduction in income tax related interest expense for our inter-company sale of intellectual property for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior year as a result of a reduction in the income tax liability. We incurred interest expense of $1.5 million for the equivalent prior period January 24, 2015 to December 31, 2015 based on third-party debt acquired in the Mergers on October 19, 2015 .\nGain on Caisson Acquisition\nOn May 2, 2017, we acquired the remaining 51% equity interests in Caisson, which we previously accounted for under the equity method. On the acquisition date, we remeasured our notes receivable due from Caisson and our existing investment in Caisson at fair value and recognized a pre-tax non-cash gain of $1.3 million and $38.1 million, respectively.\nImpairment of Cost-Method Investments\nDuring December 2017, we impaired our cost-method investments in Respicardia and Rainbow Medical, in the amounts of $5.5 million and $3.0 million, respectively. Refer to Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDuring the equivalent prior period January 24, 2015 to December 31, 2015, we fully impaired our cost-method investment in Cerbomed, a European company developing a t-VNS device for epilepsy treatment, for a loss of $5.1 million.\nForeign Exchange ( FX\u201d) and Other\nDue to the global nature of our continuing operations, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Foreign exchange and other gains were $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, consisting of net FX losses of $2.1 million associated with intercompany debt and third-party financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, net of the impact of foreign currency derivative contracts established to hedge against exchange rate movements, offset by a $3.2 million gain on a sale of the cost-method investment, Istituto Europeo di Oncologia S.R.L.\nForeign Exchange and Other consisted of net FX gains of $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily the result of our inter-company financing arrangements, and third-party financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, net of the impact of foreign currency derivative contracts established to hedge against exchange rate movements.\nForeign Exchange and Other consisted of net FX losses of $7.5 million for the equivalent prior period ended December 31, 2015, which included a loss of $5.6 million from foreign currency derivative contracts established to hedge against exchange rate movements on the loan from the European Investment Bank and other loans. The loss on the hedge was recorded in our consolidated statements of income (loss), whereas the hedged instruments' gains were recorded in comprehensive income in our consolidated financial statements.\nIncome Taxes\nLivaNova PLC is domiciled and resident in the UK. Our subsidiaries conduct operations and earn income in numerous countries and are subject to the laws of taxing jurisdictions within those countries, and the income tax rates imposed in the tax jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries conduct operations vary. As a result of the changes in the overall level of our income, the deployment of various tax strategies and the changes in tax laws, our consolidated effective income tax rate may vary from one reporting period to another.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we recorded income tax expense from continuing operations of $50.0 million and $5.1 million, respectively, with effective income tax rates of 41.2% and 19.9%, respectively. During the equivalent prior period ended December 31, 2015, we recorded an income tax benefit from continuing operations of $7.2 million and an effective income tax rate of 75.9%.\nOur 41.2% effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 included the impact of various discrete tax items, including the non-cash net charge of $27.5 million recorded as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the acquisition of\nCaisson, inclusive of the $38.1 million non-taxable gain recognized to re-measure our existing equity investments in Caisson at fair value on the acquisition date.\nOur 19.9% effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 included the impact of various discrete tax items, primarily related to a reduction in valuation allowances in the U.S. related to capital loss carryforwards, partially offset by an increase in tax expense related to an unrecognized tax benefit from a tax position taken in prior years.\nOur 75.9% effective income tax rate for the equivalent prior period January 24, 2015 to December 31, 2015, included the impact of various discrete tax items, primarily related to an increase in tax expense resulting from non-deductible transaction costs associated with the merger of Cyberonics and Sorin and an increase in tax expense due to the change in the corporate income tax rate in Italy.\nU.S. Tax Reform\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act\u201d). The Act, which is also commonly referred to as U.S. tax reform\u201d, significantly changes U.S. corporate income tax laws by, among other things, reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21% commencing in 2018. In addition, the Act created a one-time mandatory tax, a toll charge, on previously deferred foreign earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries controlled by a U.S. corporation, or, in our case, a non-U.S. subsidiary controlled by one of our U.S. subsidiaries. We recorded no toll charge for the year ended December 31, 2017 as we had no previously deferred foreign earnings of U.S. controlled foreign subsidiaries as of the measurement dates. As a result of the Act, we recorded a non-cash net charge of $27.5 million during the fourth quarter of 2017, which is included in Income tax expense (benefit) in the consolidated statement of (loss) income. This amount primarily consists of two components: (i) $12.8 million relating to the impairment of foreign tax credits, and (ii) a net $14.7 million charge resulting from the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities in the U.S. based on the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate.\nThe Act also establishes various other new U.S. corporate income tax laws that will affect 2018, including, but not limited to, (1) elimination of the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT); (2) the creation of the base erosion anti-abuse tax (BEAT), a new minimum tax; (3) a new provision designed to tax global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI); (4) a new limitation on deductible interest expense; (5) the repeal of the domestic production activity deduction; (6) limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation; and (7) limitations on net operating losses (NOLs) generated after December 31, 2017, to 80 percent of taxable income. The extent to which these and other provisions of the Act, or future legislation or regulations, could impact our consolidated effective income tax rate in future periods depends on many factors including, but not limited to, the amount of profit generated by our subsidiaries operating in the U.S., the impact of the Company's current or contemplated tax planning strategies, the impact of new or amended tax laws or regulations by countries outside the U.S., and other factors beyond our control.\nFurther regulations and notices and state conformity could be issued as a result of U.S. tax reform covering various issues that may affect our tax position including, but not limited to, an increase in the corporate state tax rate and elimination of the interest deduction. The content of any future legislation, the timing for regulations, notices, and state conformity, and the reporting periods that would be impacted cannot be determined at this time. Although we believe the net charge of $27.5 million is a reasonable estimate of the impact of the income tax effects of the Act on LivaNova as of December 31, 2017, the estimate is provisional. Once we finalize certain tax positions for our 2017 U.S. consolidated tax return, we will be able to conclude whether any further adjustments to our tax positions are required.\nBrexit\nOn June 23, 2016, the UK held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit.\u201d On March 29, 2017, the UK government gave formal notice of its intention to leave the EU, formally commencing the negotiations regarding the terms of withdrawal between the UK and the EU. The withdrawal must occur within two years, unless the deadline is extended. The negotiation process will determine the future terms of the UK's relationship with the EU. The notification does not change the application of existing tax laws, and does not establish a clear framework for what the ultimate outcome of the negotiations and legislative process will be.\nVarious tax reliefs and exemptions that apply to transactions between EU Member States under existing tax laws may cease to apply to transactions between the UK and EU Member States when the UK ultimately withdraws from the EU. It is unclear at this stage if or when any new tax treaties between the UK and the EU or individual EU Member States will replace those reliefs and exemptions. It is also unclear at this stage what financial, trade and legal implications will ensue from Brexit and how Brexit may affect us, our customers, suppliers, vendors, or our industry.\nSeveral of our wholly owned subsidiaries that are domiciled either in the UK, various EU Member States, or in the United States, and our parent company, LivaNova PLC, are party to intercompany transactions and agreements under which we receive\nvarious tax reliefs and exemptions in accordance with applicable international tax laws, treaties and regulations. If certain treaties applicable to our transactions and agreements are not renegotiated or replaced with new treaties containing terms, conditions and attributes similar to those of the existing treaties, Brexit may have a material adverse impact on our future financial results and results of operations. During the two-year negotiation period, we will monitor and assess the potential impact of this event and explore possible tax-planning strategies that may mitigate or eliminate any such potential adverse impact. We will not account for the impact of Brexit in our income tax provisions until changes in tax laws or treaties between the UK and the EU or individual EU Member States with the UK and/or the U.S. are enacted or the withdrawal becomes effective.\nEuropean Union State Aid Challenge\nOn October 26, 2017, the European Commission ( EC\u201d) announced that an investigation will be opened with respect to the UK's controlled foreign company ( CFC\u201d) rules. The CFC rules under investigation provide certain tax exceptions to entities controlled by UK parent companies that are subject to lower tax rates if the activities being undertaken by the CFC relate to financing. The EC is investigating whether the exemption is a breach of EU State Aid rules. The investigation is in its early stages and is unlikely to be completed within the next twelve months with an appeal process likely to follow. It is unclear as to whether the UK will be part of the EU once a decision has been finalized due to Brexit and what impact, if any, Brexit will have on the outcome of the investigation or the enforceability of a decision. Due to the many uncertainties related to this matter, including the preliminary state of the investigation, the pending Brexit negotiations and political environment and the unknown outcome of the investigation and resulting appeals, no uncertain tax position reserve has been recognized related to this matter and we are unable to reasonably estimate the potential liability.\nEquity Method Investments\nLosses from equity method investments were $16.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 were due to investee losses of Highlife, MicroPort and Caisson and the impairment of our investment in, and notes receivable from Highlife of $13.0 million; consisting of investment impairment of $4.7 million and the notes receivable impairment of $8.3 million. In May 2017, we acquired the remaining equity interests in Caisson and we began consolidating the results of Caisson as of the acquisition date.\nWe recognized equity method losses of $18.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 due to investee losses of Caisson, Highlife, Microport and Respicardia and the impairment of our investment in Respicardia of $9.2 million. In November 2016, we terminated our distributor agreement with Respicardia. The distributor agreement had been a key component in the determination of whether our influence over Respicardia was significant, and as a result, we determined that we no longer had significant influence over Respicardia and transferred the investment to our cost method investments.\nWe recognized losses of $2.2 million from our share of investee losses at Highlife, Caisson, Respicardia and MicroPort during the equivalent prior period ended December 31, 2015. All the equity method investments were acquired in the Mergers and therefore investee losses were included in our consolidated statement of (loss) income in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K beginning October 19, 2015.\nResults of Discontinued Operations\nThe table below illustrates the results of discontinued operations (in thousands):\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Transitional Period April 25, 2015 to December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discontinued Operations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,271\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(64,663\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14,893\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of discontinued operations, net of tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(78,283\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss from discontinued operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(79,554\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(64,663\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14,893\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn November 20, 2017, we entered into a letter of intent ( LOI\u201d) to sell our CRM Business Franchise ( CRM\u201d) to MicroPort Scientific Corporation for $190.0 million in cash. Completion of the transaction is subject to receipt of relevant regulatory approvals, including fulfilling the requirements of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange's Major Transaction requirements, and other customary closing conditions. We expect the transaction to close in the second quarter of 2018.\nCRM develops, manufactures and markets products for the diagnosis, treatment and management of heart rhythm disorders and heart failures. CRM products include high-voltage defibrillators, cardiac resynchronization therapy devices and low-voltage pacemakers. CRM has approximately 900 employees, with operations in Clamart, France; Saluggia, Italy; and Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.\nWe concluded that the sale of CRM represents a strategic shift and therefore qualifies as a discontinued operation under GAAP. As a result, we classified the operating results of CRM as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of (loss) income. Additionally, we tested the long-lived assets of CRM for impairment and recognized an impairment to tangible and intangible assets of $78.3 million, net of a $15.3 million tax benefit. The assets and liabilities of CRM are classified as assets (or liabilities) of discontinued operations on the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSignificant Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates\nWe have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). Our most significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 2. Basis of Presentation, Use of Accounting Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the consolidated financial statements. New accounting pronouncements are disclosed in Note 21. New Accounting Pronouncements\u201d in the consolidated financial statements.\nTo prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of our consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. We consider estimates to be critical if we are required to make assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation, or if materially different estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period. The following are areas requiring management's judgment that we consider critical:\nBusiness Combinations\nWe allocate the amounts we pay for each acquisition to the assets we acquire and liabilities we assume based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition, including identifiable intangible assets and in-process research and development which either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill. We base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination, including in-process research and development, on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management, which consider management's best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use. We allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired to goodwill. Transaction costs associated with these acquisitions are expensed as incurred and are reported as operating expenses.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets shown on the consolidated balance sheet are finite-lived assets. Developed technology rights consist primarily of purchased patents, related know-how and licensed patent rights. Tradenames include the Sorin trade name acquired as part of the Mergers. Customer relationships consist of relationships with hospitals and physicians in the countries where we operate. We amortize our intangible assets over their useful lives using the straight-line method.\nAmortization expense for developed technology is recorded in research and development and cost of goods sold. When the product is marketed, we amortize the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset to cost of goods sold. Amortization expense for trade name and customer relationships is recorded in selling, general and administrative expense. We evaluate our intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances indicate either a different useful life or impairment. If we change our estimate of the useful life of an asset, we amortize the carrying amount over the revised remaining useful life.\nImpairment of Property and Equipment and Intangible Assets\nWe review, when circumstances warrant, the carrying amounts of our property and equipment and our intangible assets to determine whether such carrying amounts continue to be recoverable. Such changes in circumstance may include, among other items, (i) an expectation of a sale or disposal of a long-lived asset or asset group, (ii) adverse changes in market or competitive conditions, (iii) an adverse change in legal factors or business climate in the markets in which we operate and (iv) operating or cash flow losses. For purposes of impairment testing, long-lived assets are grouped at the lowest level for which cash flows are largely independent of other assets and liabilities, generally at or below the reporting unit level. If the carrying amount of the asset or asset group is greater than the expected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by such asset or asset group, an\nimpairment adjustment is recognized. Such adjustment is measured by the amount that the carrying value of such asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. We generally measure fair value by considering (a) sale prices for similar assets, (b) discounted estimated future cash flows using an appropriate discount rate and/or (c) estimated replacement cost. Assets to be disposed of are carried at the lower of their financial statement carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.\nWe evaluate the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually on October 1st and whenever other facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable. For impairment evaluations with respect to both goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles, we first make a qualitative assessment to determine if the goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible may be impaired. In the case of goodwill, if it is more-likely-than-not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value, we then compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its respective carrying amount. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a component\u201d). Our operating segments are deemed to be our reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit were to exceed its fair value, we would then compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill to its carrying amount, and any excess of the carrying amount over the fair value would be charged to operations as an impairment loss. With respect to indefinite-lived intangible assets, if it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, we then estimate its fair value and any excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is also charged to operations as an impairment loss.\nDerivatives\nU.S. GAAP requires companies to recognize all derivatives as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and to measure the instruments at fair value through earnings unless the derivative qualifies for hedge accounting. If the derivative qualifies for hedge accounting, depending on the nature of the hedge and hedge effectiveness, changes in the fair value of the derivative will either be recognized immediately in earnings or recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings upon settlement/termination. The changes in the fair value of the derivative are intended to offset the change in fair value of the hedged asset, liability or probable commitment. We evaluate hedge effectiveness at inception and on an ongoing basis. If a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued. Hedge ineffectiveness, if any, is recorded in earnings. Cash flows from derivative contracts are reported as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nWe use currency exchange rate derivative contracts and interest rate derivative instruments, to manage the impact of currency exchange and interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows. In order to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from currency exchange rate changes, we enter into derivative instruments, principally forward currency exchange rate contracts. These contracts are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions and changes in the value of specific assets and liabilities. At inception of the forward contract, the derivative is designated as either a freestanding derivative or a cash flow hedge. We do not enter into currency exchange rate derivative contracts for speculative purposes. All derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets, as financial asset or liabilities (current or non-current) depending upon the gain or loss position of the contract and contract maturity date.\nForward contracts designated as cash flow hedges are designed to hedge the variability of cash flows associated with forecasted transactions denominated in a foreign currency that will take place in the future. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into earnings to offset exchange differences originated by the hedged item or to adjust the value of operating income (expense).\nWe use freestanding derivative forward contracts to offset exposure to the variability of the value associated with assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency. These derivatives are not designated as hedges, and therefore changes in the value of these forward contracts are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related change in value of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.\nWe use interest rate derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges to manage the exposure to interest rate movements and to reduce the risk of an increase in borrowing costs by converting floating-rate debt into fixed-rate debt. Under these agreements, we agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to agreed-upon notional principal amounts. The interest rate swaps are structured to mirror the payment terms of the underlying loan. The fair value of the interest rate swaps is reported in the consolidated balance sheets financial assets or liabilities (current or non-current) depending upon the gain or loss position of the contract and the maturity of the future cash flows of the fair value of each contract. The effective portion of the gain or loss on these derivatives is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified to interest expense in the consolidated statement of (loss) income when the underlying position is settled. The non-effective portion is reported in interest expense in consolidated statement of (loss) income.\nCost and Equity Method Investments\nCertain of the Company's investments in equity and other securities are strategic investments in companies that are in varied stages of development. These investments are included in Investments on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company accounts for these investments under the cost or the equity method of accounting, as appropriate. The valuation of equity and other securities accounted for under the cost method considers all available financial information related to the investee, including valuations based on recent third-party equity investments in the investee. If an unrealized loss for any investment is considered to be other-than-temporary, the loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of income in the period the determination is made. Equity securities accounted for under the equity method are initially recorded at the amount of the Company's investment and are adjusted each period for the Company's share of the investee's income or loss and dividends paid. Equity securities accounted for under both the cost and equity methods are reviewed quarterly for changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events that suggest the Company's investment may not be recoverable.\nStock-Based Compensation\nOur stock option awards and stock appreciation rights compensation expense is based on the fair market value of our awards and is amortized ratably over the award vesting period. The fair market value is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing methodology at the grant date. This methodology takes into account variables such as the future expected volatility of our stock price, the amount of time expected to elapse between the date of grant and the date of exercise and a risk-free interest rate. Fair values of stock option awards and stock appreciation rights issued in the future may vary significantly from fair values of awards issued in the current period depending on our estimates, and judgments regarding these variables, and therefore expense in future periods, may differ significantly from current-period expense. Refer to Note 2. Basis of Presentation, Use of Accounting Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies\u201d accompanying the consolidated financial statements for further information related to key assumptions.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are a UK corporation, and we operate through our various subsidiaries in a number of countries throughout the world. Our provision for income taxes is based on the tax laws and rates applicable in the jurisdictions in which we operate and earn income. We use significant judgment and estimates in accounting for our income taxes. This involves assessing changes in temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of events for tax and accounting purposes. These assessments result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Actual tax expense may significantly differ from our expectations if, for example, judicial interpretations of tax law, tax regulations or tax rates change.\nWe file federal and local tax returns in many jurisdictions throughout the world and are subject to income tax examinations for our fiscal year 1992 and subsequent years, with certain exceptions. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes and as a result, we may establish reserves for uncertain tax positions, which require a significant degree of management judgment. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of our tax positions in order to determine the appropriateness of our reserves for uncertain tax positions; however, the actual outcome of an audit can be significantly different than our expectations, which could have a material impact on our tax provision. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefit, as of December 31, 2017, if recognized, would reduce our income tax expense by approximately $26.1 million.\nWe are required to periodically assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets by considering whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the actual benefit of those assets will be realized. To the extent that realization does not meet the more-likely-than-not\u201d criterion, we establish a valuation allowance. We periodically review the adequacy and necessity of the valuation allowance by considering significant positive and negative evidence relative to our ability to recover deferred tax assets and to determine the timing and amount of valuation allowance that should be released. Changes in our assessment of the factors related to the recoverability of our deferred tax assets could result in materially different income tax provisions. As of December 31, 2017, we had valuation allowances of $47.4 million that were primarily related to net operating losses in certain jurisdictions and U.S. tax credits. If these valuation allowances were to be released our tax expense would be reduced by $47.4 million.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into U.S. law which provided numerous amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act may impact our U.S. income tax expense (benefit) from continuing operations in future periods.\nForeign Currency\nOur functional currency is the U.S. dollar, however, a portion of the revenues earned and expenses incurred by certain of our subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We determine the functional currency of our subsidiaries\nthat exist and operate in different economic and currency environments based on the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates, that is, the currency of the environment in which an entity primarily generates and expends cash. Our significant foreign subsidiaries are located in Europe and the U.S. The functional currency of our significant European subsidiaries is the Euro and the functional currency of our significant U.S. subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar.\nAssets and liabilities for subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars based on a combination of both current and historical exchange rates, while their revenues earned and expenses incurred are translated into U.S. dollars at average period exchange rates. Translation adjustments are included as \u2018Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)' ( AOCI\u201d) in the consolidated balance sheets. Gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in a currency different from an entity's functional currency are included in Foreign exchange and other gains (losses) in our consolidated statements of income (loss). Taxes are not provided on cumulative translation adjustments, as substantially all translation adjustments are related to earnings which are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the countries where earned.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nBased on our current business plan, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and future cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our expected operating needs, working capital requirements, R&D opportunities, capital expenditures and debt service requirements over the next 12 months. We regularly review our capital needs and consider various investing and financing alternatives to support our requirements. Refer to Note 10. Financing Arrangements\u201d in the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our debt. Our liquidity could be adversely affected by the factors affecting future operating results, including those referred to in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d above.\nCash Flows\nNet cash and cash equivalents provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities and the net increase (decrease) in the balance of cash and cash equivalents were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Transitional Period April 25, 2015 to December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended April 24, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>91,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9,288\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79,676\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(52,855\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(44,516\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,765\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(118,039\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18,127\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(48,256\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,048\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(420\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(341\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(767\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (decreases) increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,826\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(72,824\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11,574\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 $91.3 million, primarily due to adjustments to net income of $220.0 million for non-cash items, which included a non-cash loss of $93.6 million related to the impairment of tangible and intangible assets of our discontinued operations, and depreciation and amortization of $82.9 million, offset by utilization of cash for operating assets and liabilities of $103.6 million.\nCash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $90.2 million, primarily due to a net loss of $62.8 million offset by $161.3 million of non-cash items. Non-cash items were principally composed of $85.4 million in depreciation and amortization and $19.6 million in stock-based compensation.\nDuring the transitional period April 25, 2015 to December 31, 2015, cash utilized in operating activities was $9.3 million, which was net of amortization of $36.3 million related to Sorin's inventory written-up in the Mergers. In connection with the Mergers we acquired $233.8 million of Sorin inventory as of October 19, 2015. In addition, we utilized operating cash for payment of accrued merger costs, which primarily accounted for the decrease in our balance of accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $32.8 million.\nCash provided by operating activities for the historical Cyberonics fiscal year ended April 24, 2015 was $79.7 million, which was primarily attributable to net income of $57.8 million and non-cash operating expense and FX losses of $28.2 million, offset by $6.3 million utilized by operating assets and liabilities, primarily to build inventories.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities was $52.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. We invested $34.1 million in property, plant and equipment. We also utilized cash of $27.9 million related to our investments in privately held medical start-up companies, which included the purchase of the 51% of the remaining interest in Caisson utilizing cash of $14.2 million, and investments in, and loans to, our equity and cost method investees of $13.7 million.\nCash used in investing activities was $44.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to $38.4 million invested in property, plant and equipment and investments in, and loans to, our equity and cost method investees of $14.3 million. These amounts were partially offset by the transfer of $7.0 million to cash and cash equivalents from short-term investments.\nCash provided in investing activities of $16.2 million during the transitional period April 25, 2015 to December 31, 2015 was due to the transfer of $20.0 million to cash and cash equivalents from short-term investments and an increase in cash of $12.5 million obtained in the Mergers, offset by net investment activity of $16.3 million, primarily for property, plant and equipment.\nCash used in investing activities was $9.8 million during the fiscal year ended April 24, 2015. We invested $1.9 million in commercial paper. We also invested $6.7 million in property, plant and equipment primarily due to construction of the Costa Rica manufacturing facility. We also invested $1.2 million in Cerbomed, which was fully impaired during the transitional period April 25, 2015 to December 31, 2015.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 was $11.3 million, which includes $32.4 million in borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and repayment of long-term debt of $22.8 million. We also borrowed $2.0 million in additional long-term debt.\nCash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 was $118.0 million, which includes $54.5 million to repurchase shares, a $33.7 million reduction in revolving credit facilities, repayment of advances on customer receivables of $23.8 million and repayment of long-term debt of $21.1 million. We also borrowed $7.2 million in additional long-term debt.\nCash used in financing activities during the transitional period April 25, 2015 to December 31, 2015 was $18.1 million, which included the repayment of long-term debt of $32.0 million, and the purchase of treasury shares for $7.3 million, partially offset by cash proceeds from net short-term debt borrowing of $11.1 million and stock based compensation activities of $8.8 million.\nCash used in financing activities during the year ended April 24, 2015 was $48.3 million, which was primarily due to stock repurchases of $55.0 million.\nDebt and Capital\nOur capital structure consists of debt and equity. As of December 31, 2017, our total debt of $146 million was 8.0% of total equity of $1.8 billion. As of December 31, 2016, our total debt of $123 million was 7.2% of total equity of $1.7 billion.\nDebt Acquired in the Mergers\nAt the consummation of the Mergers on October 19, 2015, LivaNova acquired all of the outstanding debt of Sorin in the aggregate principal amount of $203.0 million payable to various financial and non-financial institutions. Prior to the Mergers Cyberonics had no debt.\nDebt - Post Mergers\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we increased our outstanding revolving credit facilities by $32.4 million, repaid $22.8 million of long-term debt obligations and borrowed $2.0 million in additional long-term debt.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we reduced our outstanding revolving credit facilities by $33.7 million, repaid $21.1 million of long-term debt obligations and borrowed $7.2 million in additional long-term debt.\nFactoring\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we reduced our obligation for advances on customer receivables by $23.8 million, thereby eliminating this form of financing.\nContractual Obligations\nWe have various contractual commitments that we expect to fund from existing cash, future operating cash flows and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. The actual timing of the clinical commitment payments may vary based on the completion of milestones which are beyond our control. The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 and the periods in which such obligations are due (in thousands):\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less Than One Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>One to Three Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Three to Five Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Contractual Obligations\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal payments on short-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal payments on long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,844\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,793\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments on long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>788\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>848\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Caisson deferred consideration\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventory supply contract obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Derivative instruments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>588\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>502\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>116,724\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>92,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,490\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>262,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Contractual obligations do not include $26.1 million of unrecognized tax benefits, inclusive of interest and penalties, included on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017.

These commitments include letters of credit to guarantee our performance as it relates to our contract bidding, VAT tax, tax appeals, and other obligations in various jurisdictions. Obligations under these guarantees are not normally called, as we typically comply with underlying performance requirements. As of December 31, 2017, no liability has been recorded in the financial statements associated with these obligations.\nThe following table summarizes our guarantees as of December 31, 2017 (in thousands):\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less Than One Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>One to Three Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Three to Five Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Guarantees\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Guarantees on governmental bids (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>863\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Guarantees - commercial (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>962\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>481\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Guarantees to tax authorities (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>242\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,833\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Guarantees to third-parties (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>153\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total guarantees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,649\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,293\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Government bid guarantees include such items as unconditional bank guarantees, irrevocable letters of credit and bid bonds.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Commercial guarantees include our lease and tenancy guarantees.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>The guarantees to the governmental tax authorities consist primarily of the guarantee issued to the Italian VAT Authority.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(4)\n</td> <td>Guarantees to third-parties consist primarily of irrevocable letters of credit and tenancy guarantees.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMarket Risk\nWe are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations, including risks from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rate risks and concentration of procurement suppliers that could adversely affect our consolidated balance sheets, net (loss) income and cash flow.\nWe manage these risks through regular operating and financing activities and, at certain times, derivative financial instruments.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nDue to the global nature of our operations, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We maintain a foreign currency exchange rate risk management strategy that utilizes derivatives to reduce our exposure to unanticipated fluctuations in forecast revenue and costs and fair values of debt, inter-company debt and accounts receivables caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nWe mitigate our credit risk relating to counter-parties of our derivatives through a variety of techniques, including transacting with multiple, high-quality financial institutions, thereby limiting our exposure to individual counter-parties and by entering into International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. ( ISDA\u201d) Master Agreements, which include provisions for a legally enforceable master netting agreement, with almost all of our derivative counter-parties. The terms of the ISDA agreements may also include credit support requirements, cross default provisions, termination events, or set-off provisions. Legally enforceable master netting agreements reduce credit risk by providing protection in bankruptcy in certain circumstances and generally permitting the closeout and netting of transactions with the same counter-party upon the occurrence of certain events.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are subject to interest rate risk on our investments and debt. We manage a portion of our interest rate risk with contracts that swap floating-rate interest payments for fixed rate interest payments. If interest rates were to increase or decrease by 0.5%, the effects on our consolidated statement of (loss) income would not be material.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nOur trade accounts receivable represent potential concentrations of credit risk. This risk is limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across a number of geographic areas, as well as our efforts to control our exposure to credit risk by monitoring our receivables and the use of credit approvals and credit limits. In addition, we have historically had strong collections and minimal write-offs. While we believe that our reserves for credit losses are adequate, essentially all of our trade receivables are concentrated in the hospital and healthcare sectors worldwide, and accordingly, we are exposed to their respective business, economic and country-specific variables. Although we do not currently foresee a concentrated credit risk associated with these receivables, repayment is dependent on the financial stability of these industry sectors and the respective countries' national economies and healthcare systems.\nFactors Affecting Future Operating Results and Share Price\nThe factors affecting our future operating results and share prices are disclosed in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis together with Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the matters set forth in Cautionary Statement About Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as of and for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the transitional period April 25, 2015 to December 31, 2015 and the fiscal year ended April 24, 2015.\nDescription of the Business\nWe are a global medical device company focused on the development and delivery of important therapeutic solutions for the benefit of patients, healthcare professionals and healthcare systems throughout the world. Working closely with medical professionals in the fields of Cardiac Surgery and Neuromodulation, we design, develop, manufacture and sell innovative therapeutic solutions that are consistent with our mission to improve our patients' quality of life, increase the skills and capabilities of healthcare professionals and minimize healthcare costs.\nSale of the CRM Business Franchise\nOn November 20, 2017, we entered the LOI to sell CRM to MicroPort Scientific Corporation for $190 million in cash. The results of operations of CRM are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Refer to the Discontinued Operations discussion below and to Note 4. Discontinued Operations to the Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBackground and the Mergers\nHeadquartered in London, LivaNova PLC (collectively with its subsidiaries, the Company\u201d, LivaNova\u201d, we\u201d or our\u201d) was organized under the laws of England and Wales on February 20, 2015 for the purpose of facilitating the business combination of Cyberonics, Inc., a Delaware corporation ( Cyberonics\u201d) and Sorin S.p.A., a joint stock company organized under the laws of Italy ( Sorin\u201d). As a result of the business combination, we became the holding company of the combined businesses of Cyberonics and Sorin. This business combination (the Mergers\u201d) became effective on October 19, 2015, at which time our shares were listed for trading on the NASDAQ Global Market ( NASDAQ\u201d) and on the London Stock Exchange (the LSE\u201d) as a standard listing under the trading symbol LIVN.\u201d Upon the consummation of the Mergers, the historical financial statements of Cyberonics became the Company's historical financial statements. Accordingly, the historical financial statements of Cyberonics are included in the comparative prior periods. For further information regarding the acquisition, refer to Note 3. Business Combinations\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBusiness Franchises\nLivaNova is comprised of two principal Business Franchises: Cardiac Surgery and Neuromodulation, corresponding to our main therapeutic areas. Corporate activities include corporate business development and New Ventures. New Ventures is focused on new growth platforms and identification of other opportunities for expansion.\nCardiac Surgery Update\nOur Cardiac Surgery Business Franchise ( CS\u201d) is engaged in the development, production and sale of cardiac surgery products, including oxygenators, heart-lung machines, perfusion tubing systems, cannulae and other accessories used for extracorporeal circulation, systems for autologous blood transfusion and blood washing, as well as a complete line of surgical tissue and mechanical heart valve replacements and repair products.\nResearch and Development updates\nIn October 2015, we announced the initiation of PERSIST-AVR, the first international, prospective post-market randomized multi-center clinical study evaluating the Perceval sutureless aortic valve compared to standard sutured bioprostheses in patients with aortic valve disease. The Perceval valve, the only sutureless biological aortic valve replacement ( AVR\u201d) on the market today, employs a unique self-anchoring frame that enables the surgeon to replace the diseased valve without suturing it into place. The study is expected to enroll 1,234 patients within a two-year enrollment period and patients will be followed until five years post procedure. In January 2017, the independent study, Aortic Valve Replacement With Sutureless Perceval Bioprosthesis: Single-Center Experience With 617 Implants,\u201d was presented to The Society of Thoracic Surgeons. The study found AVR procedures conducted with the Perceval sutureless valve resulted in low mortality and excellent hemodynamic performance for patients.\nCardiopulmonary product updates\nIn September 2017, we received FDA 510(k) clearance for the U.S. market launch of our Optiflow Arterial Cannulae Family. Optiflow aortic arch cannulae provide improved hydrodynamics with a novel dispersive tip design that improves blood flow characteristics resulting in reduced wall shear stress ( WSS\u201d) profiles. Optiflow Arterial cannulae feature a unique basket tip with large openings that allow a more physiologically compatible dispersive design. This design has been shown to significantly reduce WSS and turbulence, thereby improving hydrodynamics and potentially reducing ischemic complications from extracorporeal circulation during cardiac surgery.\nFDA Warning Letter\nOn December 29, 2015, the FDA issued a Warning Letter (the Warning Letter\u201d) alleging certain violations of FDA regulations applicable to medical device manufacturers at our Munich, Germany and Arvada, Colorado facilities. Among other things, the Warning Letter stated that our 3T devices and other devices we manufactured at our Munich facility are subject to refusal of admission into the U.S. until resolution of the issues set forth by the FDA in the Warning Letter. The FDA has informed us that the import alert is limited to the 3T devices, but that the agency reserves the right to expand the scope of the import alert if future circumstances warrant such action. The Warning Letter did not request that existing users cease using the 3T device, and manufacturing and shipment of all of our products other than the 3T device remain unaffected by the import limitation. To help clarify these issues for current customers, we issued an informational Customer Letter in January 2016, and that same month agreed with the FDA on a process for shipping 3T devices to existing U.S. users pursuant to a certificate of medical necessity program. We continue to work diligently to remediate the FDA's inspectional observations for the Munich facility, as well as the additional issues identified in the Warning Letter. For further information, please refer to Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCDC and FDA Safety Communications and Company Field Safety Notice Update\nOn October 13, 2016 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC\u201d) and FDA separately released safety notifications regarding the 3T devices. The CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report ( MMWR\u201d) and Health Advisory Notice ( HAN\u201d) reported that tests conducted by CDC and its affiliates indicate that there appears to be genetic similarity between both patient and 3T device strains of the non-tuberculous mycobacterium ( NTM\u201d) bacteria M. chimaera isolated in hospitals in Iowa and Pennsylvania. Citing the geographic separation between the two hospitals referenced in the investigation, the report asserts that 3T devices manufactured prior to August 18, 2014 could have been contaminated during the manufacturing process. The CDC's HAN and FDA's Safety Communication, issued contemporaneously with the MMWR report, each assess certain risks associated with 3T devices and provide guidance for providers and patients. On October 13, 2016, we issued a Field Safety Notice Update for U.S. users of 3T devices to proactively and voluntarily contact facilities to aid in implementation of the CDC and FDA recommendations. For further information, please refer to Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nProduct Remediation Plan\nIn response to the Warning Letter and CDC's HAN and FDA's Safety Commission, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we initiated a program to provide existing 3T device users with a new loaner 3T device at no charge pending regulatory approval and implementation of additional risk mitigation strategies worldwide. This loaner program began in the U.S. and is being made available progressively on a global basis, prioritizing and allocating devices to 3T device users based on pre-established criteria. We anticipate that this program will continue until we are able to address customer needs through a broader solution that includes implementation of one or more of the risk mitigation strategies currently under review with regulatory agencies. We are also currently implementing a vacuum and sealing upgrade program in as many countries as possible throughout 2018 and beyond until all devices are upgraded. Furthermore, we intend to perform a no-charge deep disinfection service for 3T device users who have reported confirmed M. chimaera mycobacterium contamination. Although the deep disinfection service is not yet available in the U.S., it is currently offered in many countries around the world and will be expanded to additional geographies as we receive the required regulatory approvals.\nOn December 31, 2016, we recognized a liability for our product remediation plan related to our 3T device. We concluded that it was probable that a liability had been incurred upon management's approval of the plan and the commitments made by management to various regulatory authorities globally in November and December 2016, and furthermore, the cost associated with the plan was reasonably estimable. At December 31, 2017, the product remediation liability was $27.5 million. Refer to Note 6. Product Remediation Liability\u201d for additional information.\nHeart Valve product updates\nIn January 2016, we announced FDA approval of the Perceval sutureless valve. While we have been selling Perceval in other parts of the world for several years, we began commercial distribution of the device in the United States last year, with the first\nimplant announced on March 8, 2016. The Perceval valve has been implanted in more than 25,000 patients in more than 310 hospitals in 34 countries across the world.\nIn early February 2016, we announced that we received FDA approval of our CROWN PRT valve for the treatment of aortic valve disease. The CROWN PRT valve uses a stented aortic bioprosthesis technology and features a surgeon-friendly design, with optimized hemodynamics and a patented phospholipid reduction treatment ( PRT\u201d), designed to enhance valve durability. We launched the CROWN PRT valve in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016.\nSale of our Suzhou Industrial Park facility in Shanghai, China\nIn March 2017, we committed to a plan to sell our Suzhou Industrial Park facility in Shanghai, China, an emerging market greenfield project for the local manufacture of Cardiopulmonary disposable products in Suzhou Industrial Park in China. As a result of this exit plan, we recorded an impairment of the building and equipment of $5.4 million and accrued $0.5 million of additional costs, primarily related to employee severance, during the year ended December 31, 2017, included in \u2018Restructuring expenses' in the consolidated statement of (loss) income. In addition, the land, building and equipment were recorded as Assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet, with a carrying value of $13.6 million as of December 31, 2017. In December, 2017, we executed a letter of intent for the sale of the Suzhou facility.\nNeuromodulation Update\nThe Neuromodulation segment designs, develops and markets neuromodulation therapy for the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy and treatment resistant depression. Through this segment, we market our proprietary implantable VNS Therapy\u00ae Systems that deliver vagus nerve stimulation therapy for the treatment of epilepsy and depression.\nResearch and Development updates\nOur product development efforts are directed toward improving the VNS Therapy System and developing new products that provide additional features and functionality. We are conducting ongoing product development activities to enhance the VNS Therapy System pulse generator, lead and programming software. We support studies for our product development efforts and to build clinical evidence for the VNS Therapy System. We will be required to obtain appropriate U.S. and international regulatory approvals, and clinical studies may be a prerequisite to regulatory approvals for some products. Our research and development ( R&D\u201d) efforts will require significant funding to complete and may not be successful. Even if successful, additional clinical studies may be needed to achieve regulatory approval and to commercialize any or all new or improved products. Several development projects were either terminated or halted during year ended December 31, 2016. We made the decision to focus our efforts on projects we believe have a strong likelihood of meeting both patient and physician needs in the near term.\nProduct updates\nEpilepsy\nIn October 2017, we obtained FDA approval to market our SenTiva VNS Therapy System, which consists of the SenTiva implantable generator and the next-generation VNS Therapy Programming System. SenTiva is the smallest and lightest responsive therapy for epilepsy. The new VNS Therapy Programming System features a wireless wand and new user interface on a small tablet. Together, these components offer patients with drug-resistant epilepsy a physician-directed, customizable therapy with smart technology that reduces the number of seizures, lessens the duration of seizures and enables a faster recovery.\nIn June 2017, the FDA approved our VNS Therapy device for use in patients who are at least four years of age and have partial onset seizures that are refractory to antiepileptic medications. VNS Therapy is the first and only FDA-approved device for drug-resistant epilepsy in this pediatric population. Previously, VNS Therapy was approved by the FDA for patients 12 years or older.\nIn addition, in June 2017, we received FDA approval, and in August 2017, we received CE Mark approval, for our VNS Therapy device for expanded magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI\u201d) labeling affirming VNS Therapy as the only epilepsy device approved by the FDA for MRI scans. Currently, SenTiva, AspireHC and AspireSR models of VNS Therapy technology provide for this expanded MRI access.\nDepression\nIn March 2017, the American Journal of Psychiatry published the results of the longest and largest naturalistic study on effective treatments for patients experiencing chronic and severe depression. The findings showed that the addition of VNS Therapy to traditional treatment methods is effective in reducing symptoms in patients with treatment-resistant depression.\nCosta Rica Manufacturing plant closure\nIn October 2016, management initiated a plan to exit the Costa Rica manufacturing operations and transfer those activities to Houston, Texas. We recorded an impairment of the building and equipment of $5.7 million in fiscal year 2016, which was included in \u2018Restructuring expenses' in the consolidated statement of (loss) income. In addition, the carrying value of $4.5 million for the land and building after impairment was reclassified as Assets held for sale and were included in \u2018Other current assets' in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016. We completed the sale of the Costa Rica facility during the year ended December 31, 2017 and received $4.9 million in proceeds from the sale.\nCorporate Activities and New Ventures\nCorporate activities include shared services for finance, legal, human resources and information technology, corporate business development and New Ventures. New Ventures is focused on new growth platforms and identification of other opportunities for expansion.\nHeart failure\nWith respect to heart failure, New Ventures is focused on the development and clinical testing of the VITARIA System for treating heart failure through vagus nerve stimulation.\nWe received CE Mark approval of the VITARIA System in February 2015 for patients who have moderate to severe heart failure (New York Heart Association Class II/III) with left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction < 40%) and who remain symptomatic despite stable, optimal heart failure drug therapy. The VITARIA System provides a specific method of VNS called autonomic regulation therapy ( ART\u201d), and it includes the same elements as the VNS Therapy System. We conducted a pilot study, ANTHEM-HF, outside the United States, which concluded in 2014. The study results support the safety and efficacy of ART delivered by the VITARIA System. The VITARIA System is not approved in the U.S. During 2014, we also initiated a second pilot study, ANTHEM-HFpEF, to study ART in patients experiencing symptomatic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. This pilot study is currently underway outside the United States.\nSleep Apnea\nIn October 2014, Sorin invested $20.0 million in Respicardia, a U.S.-based developer of implantable therapies designed to improve Respiratory Rhythm Management and cardiovascular health. Respicardia's remed\u0113\u00ae System is an implantable device system designed to restore a more natural breathing pattern during sleep in patients with central sleep apnea (CSA) by transvenously stimulating the phrenic nerve. The remed\u0113 System received CE Mark certification in 2010 and in October 2017, Respicardia received U.S. FDA market approval. In September 2016, we elected not to exercise our option to purchase the outstanding shares of Respicardia as the investment no longer met our objective for substantial ongoing involvement taken into consideration with our overall portfolio management program. As a result, in September 2016 we recorded an impairment of $9.2 million equal to the amount of the carrying value of the option. In addition, we terminated our exclusive distribution agreement with Respicardia in November 2016. In December 2017, certain factors, including an additional round of external financing with a new investor, indicated that the carrying value of our investment might not be recoverable and the decrease in value of our investment was other than temporary. Our estimate of the fair value of our investment using the income approach resulted below our carrying value and as a result, we recorded an additional impairment of $5.5 million. This impairment was recorded in \u2018Impairment of cost-method investments' in our consolidated statement of (loss) income.\nWe have invested in ImThera Medical, Inc. ( ImThera\u201d), a privately held, emerging-growth company developing an implantable neurostimulation device system for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA\u201d) since 2011. On January 16, 2018 we acquired the remaining 86% outstanding interests in ImThera for up to approximately $225 million. Up-front costs are approximately $78 million with the balance paid on a schedule driven by regulatory and sales milestones. Headquartered in San Diego, California, ImThera manufactures an implantable device that stimulates multiple tongue muscles via the hypoglossal nerve, which opens the airway while a patient is sleeping. The ImThera device is highly aligned with our Neuromodulation Business Franchise. ImThera has a commercial presence in the European market, while we will be advancing ImThera's enrollment in an FDA pivotal study. We expect to submit pivotal trial results to the FDA towards the end of 2019 or in early 2020.\nMitral Valve Regurgitation\nMitral regurgitation ( MR\u201d) occurs when the heart's mitral valve does not close tightly, which allows blood to flow backwards in the heart. This reduces the amount of blood that flows to the rest of the body, making the patient feel tired or out of breath. Treatment depends on the nature and the severity of MR. In certain cases, heart surgery may be needed to repair or replace the valve. Left untreated, severe MR can cause heart failure or heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias).\nCaisson Interventional, LLC ( Caisson\u201d) is a clinical-stage medical device company based in Maple Grove, Minnesota and is focused on the design, development and clinical evaluation of a novel transcatheter mitral valve replacement ( TMVR\u201d) implant device with a fully transvenous delivery system for the treatment of mitral regurgitation. On May 2, 2017, we acquired the remaining 51% outstanding equity interests in Caisson for a purchase price of up to $72.0 million, in support of our strategic growth initiatives. As a result of our acquisition of Caisson, we began consolidating the results of Caisson as of May 2, 2017. In April 2016, Caisson obtained FDA approval of an Investigational Device Exemption study using its technology for treating mitral regurgitation heart failure with transcatheter mitral valve replacement and we are currently executing against a defined clinical data development plan designed to enable commercialization of the Caisson technology.\nWe are also invested in two mitral valve startups. Cardiosolutions Inc. ( Cardiosolutions\u201d) and Highlife S.A.S. ( Highlife\u201d). Cardiosolutions, a startup headquartered in the U.S. in which we have held an interest since 2012, is developing an innovative spacer technology for treating mitral regurgitation. Highlife, headquartered in France, is focused on developing devices for treating mitral regurgitation through percutaneous replacement of the native mitral valve. We recognized an impairment of our equity method investment in, and notes receivable from, Highlife during the year ended December 31, 2017, due to certain factors including a revision in our investment strategy that indicated that the carrying value of our aggregate investment might not be recoverable and that the decrease in value of our aggregate investment was other than temporary. We, therefore, estimated the fair value of our investment and notes receivable using the market approach and recorded an aggregate impairment of $13.0 million.\nResults of Continuing Operations\nThe merger of Cyberonics and Sorin on October 19, 2015 was considered a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting, with Cyberonics considered the acquirer of Sorin. As a result, Sorin's assets and liabilities were combined at their estimated fair values. In addition, LivaNova became the holding company of the combined businesses of Cyberonics and Sorin and the successor\u201d company to Cyberonics for accounting and Exchange Act reporting purposes.\nUnderstanding Our Financial Information\nIn this Annual Report on Form 10-K, LivaNova, as the successor company to Cyberonics, is reporting (in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States) the results for:\n \u2022 LivaNova and its consolidated subsidiaries for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. \n \u2022 A transitional period, April 25, 2015 to December 31, 2015, filed on Form 10-K/T. This transitional report is the result of the change from Cyberonics' fiscal year ending the last Friday in April before the Mergers to a calendar year ending December 31st after the Mergers. The transitional period included the business activities of Cyberonics and its consolidated subsidiaries for the period April 25, 2015 to October 18, 2015, and the consolidated results of the combined businesses of LivaNova (Cyberonics and Sorin) for the period October 19, 2015 to December 31, 2015. \n \u2022 LivaNova is also reporting the historical results of Cyberonics and its consolidated subsidiaries for the fiscal year ended April 24, 2015.  The transitional period, April 25, 2015 to December 31, 2015, as described above, impacts the comparability of the revenues, cost of sales and expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, and as such, we have provided an unaudited equivalent prior period consisting of business activity for the period January 24, 2015 to December 31, 2015. The unaudited equivalent prior period included the transitional period April 25, 2015 to December 31, 2015, and the unaudited Cyberonics fourth quarter data from the fiscal year ended April 24, 2015, or January 24, 2015 to April 24, 2015. The equivalent prior period has 18 fewer working days than the year ended December 31, 2016 and 17 working days fewer than the year ended December 31, 2017.\nIn addition, amortization expense of $7.7 million and $1.0 million for the transitional period April 25, 2015 to December 31, 2015, and the prior fiscal year ended April 24, 2015, respectively, was reclassified on the consolidated statements of income (loss) in order to conform with the presentation for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Amortization was reclassified from Cost of sales, selling, general and administrative and research and development and reported separately on the consolidated statements of income (loss).\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated results for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the equivalent prior period January 24, 2015 to December 31, 2015, and the fiscal year

Geographic and Segment Information\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, except for the Equivalent Prior Period January 24, 2015 to December 31, 2015, which includes the period January 24, 2015 to April 24, 2015, as compared to the Transitional period April 25, 2015 to December 31, 2015 used in the consolidated financial statements.  Cardiac Surgery\nCardiac Surgery net sales increased $23.8 million, or 3.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 due primarily to growth of $22.9 million in cardiopulmonary product revenue. Cardiopulmonary product sales increased year over year due to continued progress towards upgrading customers from our S3 heart-lung machines to our current S5 device, strong sales of our Inspire oxygenator and favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Heart valve sales increased by $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, due to favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which more than offset continuing global declines in traditional tissue and mechanical heart valves.\nCardiac Surgery operating income increased by $64.4 million or the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily driven by increased sales of $23.8 million combined with inventory fair value step-up amortization of $25.2 million that was recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The inventory fair value step-up was fully amortized by September 30, 2016.\nCardiac Surgery net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the equivalent prior period January 24, 2015 to December 31, 2015 increased by 314.3% because sales in the prior equivalent period were limited to the period October 19, 2015 (acquisition date for the Mergers) through December 31, 2015. Additionally, Cardiac Surgery operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the equivalent prior period January 24, 2015 to December 31, 2015 increased by 26.6% due to the acquisition date for the Mergers.\nNeuromodulation\nNeuromodulation net sales increased $23.6 million, or 6.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the prior year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to strong demand for the AspireSR VNS Therapy System and the launch of the SenTiva VNS Therapy System in October 2017.\nThe increase in Neuromodulation operating income for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior-year period, was primarily driven by increased operating leverage as a result of higher net sales, partially offset by the increased costs associated with sales force expansion and marketing efforts in the U.S.\nNeuromodulation net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $62.6 million, or 21.7%, as compared to the equivalent prior period January 24, 2015 to December 31, 2015, due primarily to pricing increases in the U.S. and to 17 fewer working days in the equivalent prior period.\nNeuromodulation operating income increased $61.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the equivalent prior period January 24, 2015 to December 31, 2015, due primarily to reporting corporate and intangible amortization expense for Cyberonics prior to the Mergers as Neuromodulation Business Franchise expenses rather than as \u2018Other' expenses.\nCost of Sales and Expenses\nThe table below illustrates our cost of sales and major expenses as a percentage of net sales:\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Equivalent Prior Period January 24, 2015 to December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Unaudited)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product remediation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Merger and integration expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangibles\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales consisted primarily of direct labor, allocated manufacturing overhead, the acquisition cost of raw materials and components.\nCost of sales as a percentage of net sales was 34.9% for the year ended December 31, 2017; a decrease of 3.2% as compared to the prior year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was due to the decrease in amortization of inventory written-up in the Mergers related to the Cardiac Surgery Segment of $25.2 million, which accounted for 2.6% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nCost of sales as a percentage of net sales was 38.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016; an increase of 10.4% as compared to the equivalent period ended December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily due to the inclusion of Sorin's Cardiac Surgery Business Franchise activities for the full year in 2016 as compared to its inclusion in the prior equivalent period for October 19, 2015 (acquisition date for the Mergers) through December 31, 2015.\nSelling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d) Expenses\nSG&A expenses are comprised of sales, marketing, general and administrative activities. SG&A expenses exclude expenses incurred in connection with the merger between Cyberonics and Sorin, integration costs after the Mergers and restructuring costs under the Restructuring Plans initiated after the Mergers.\nSG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 0.6% to 37.6% as compared to the prior year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was largely attributable to litigation related to our 3T devices, costs associated with acquisitions and other legal matters.\nSG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased 3.4% to 37.0% as compared to the equivalent prior period ended December 31, 2015. This reduction was due to our integration and re-organization efforts that capitalized on synergies between Cyberonics and Sorin's Cardiac Surgery segment.\nResearch and Development ( R&D\u201d) Expenses\nR&D expenses consist of product design and development efforts, clinical study programs and regulatory activities, which are essential to the Company's strategic portfolio initiatives, including TMVR, Treatment Resistant Depression and Heart Failure.\nR&D expenses as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by 2.3% to 10.8% as compared to the prior year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Caisson in May 2017, inclusive of $5.8 million in post-combination compensation expense recognized concurrent with the acquisition of Caisson, and $7.2 million in compensation expense associated with the retention of the employees of Caisson. The additional increase as compared to the prior year was due to increased investment in clinical and registries pertaining to TMVR and Heart Failure.\nR&D expenses as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased by 3.5% to 8.5% as compared to the prior equivalent period ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily due to completion of work, adaption to longer developmental schedules or cancellation of work in 2016.\nMerger and Integration Expenses\nMerger and integration expenses consisted primarily of consulting costs associated with computer systems integration efforts, organization structure integration, synergy and tax planning, as well as the integration of internal controls for the two legacy organizations. In addition, integration expenses include retention bonuses, branding and renaming efforts and lease cancellation penalties in Milan and Brussels.\nMerger and integration expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 1.5% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared 2.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016, and 14.7% for the equivalent period ended December 31, 2015, due to the continued decline in integration activities associated with the Mergers.\nRestructuring Expenses\nOur restructuring plans (the Plans\u201d) leverage economies of scale, eliminate duplicate corporate expenses and streamline distributions, logistics and office functions in order to reduce overall costs. Restructuring expenses are detailed in Note 5. Restructuring Plans\u201d in the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our 2015 and 2016 Reorganization Plans (the Plans\u201d) were initiated October 2015 and March 2016, respectively, in conjunction with the completion of the Mergers. The Plans included the Costa Rica manufacturing operation exit plan, initiated in December 2016 and completed during 2017, and the Suzhou, China exit plan, initiated in March 2017.\nRestructuring expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 1.7% from 3.9% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 as our restructuring activities declined and continue to decline. For the equivalent period ended December 31, 2015, restructuring expenses were 2.4% as a percentage of net sales.\nAmortization of Intangibles\nAmortization of intangibles includes the amortization of finite-lived intangible assets, primarily intellectual property and customer relationships, acquired at fair value in the Mergers in October 2015. Amortization of intangibles does not include amortization of the step-up of inventory to fair value at the Mergers, which was reported as a component of cost of sales. Prior to the Mergers, Cyberonics' intangible asset amortization was primarily related to intellectual property utilized in R&D activities.\nInterest Expense\nWe incurred interest expense of $7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due a reduction in income tax related interest expense for our inter-company sale of intellectual property for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior year as a result of a reduction in the income tax liability. We incurred interest expense of $1.5 million for the equivalent prior period January 24, 2015 to December 31, 2015 based on third-party debt acquired in the Mergers on October 19, 2015 .\nGain on Caisson Acquisition\nOn May 2, 2017, we acquired the remaining 51% equity interests in Caisson, which we previously accounted for under the equity method. On the acquisition date, we remeasured our notes receivable due from Caisson and our existing investment in Caisson at fair value and recognized a pre-tax non-cash gain of $1.3 million and $38.1 million, respectively.\nImpairment of Cost-Method Investments\nDuring December 2017, we impaired our cost-method investments in Respicardia and Rainbow Medical, in the amounts of $5.5 million and $3.0 million, respectively. Refer to Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDuring the equivalent prior period January 24, 2015 to December 31, 2015, we fully impaired our cost-method investment in Cerbomed, a European company developing a t-VNS device for epilepsy treatment, for a loss of $5.1 million.\nForeign Exchange ( FX\u201d) and Other\nDue to the global nature of our continuing operations, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Foreign exchange and other gains were $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, consisting of net FX losses of $2.1 million associated with intercompany debt and third-party financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, net of the impact of foreign currency derivative contracts established to hedge against exchange rate movements, offset by a $3.2 million gain on a sale of the cost-method investment, Istituto Europeo di Oncologia S.R.L.\nForeign Exchange and Other consisted of net FX gains of $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily the result of our inter-company financing arrangements, and third-party financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, net of the impact of foreign currency derivative contracts established to hedge against exchange rate movements.\nForeign Exchange and Other consisted of net FX losses of $7.5 million for the equivalent prior period ended December 31, 2015, which included a loss of $5.6 million from foreign currency derivative contracts established to hedge against exchange rate movements on the loan from the European Investment Bank and other loans. The loss on the hedge was recorded in our consolidated statements of income (loss), whereas the hedged instruments' gains were recorded in comprehensive income in our consolidated financial statements.\nIncome Taxes\nLivaNova PLC is domiciled and resident in the UK. Our subsidiaries conduct operations and earn income in numerous countries and are subject to the laws of taxing jurisdictions within those countries, and the income tax rates imposed in the tax jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries conduct operations vary. As a result of the changes in the overall level of our income, the deployment of various tax strategies and the changes in tax laws, our consolidated effective income tax rate may vary from one reporting period to another.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we recorded income tax expense from continuing operations of $50.0 million and $5.1 million, respectively, with effective income tax rates of 41.2% and 19.9%, respectively. During the equivalent prior period ended December 31, 2015, we recorded an income tax benefit from continuing operations of $7.2 million and an effective income tax rate of 75.9%.\nOur 41.2% effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 included the impact of various discrete tax items, including the non-cash net charge of $27.5 million recorded as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the acquisition of\nCaisson, inclusive of the $38.1 million non-taxable gain recognized to re-measure our existing equity investments in Caisson at fair value on the acquisition date.\nOur 19.9% effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 included the impact of various discrete tax items, primarily related to a reduction in valuation allowances in the U.S. related to capital loss carryforwards, partially offset by an increase in tax expense related to an unrecognized tax benefit from a tax position taken in prior years.\nOur 75.9% effective income tax rate for the equivalent prior period January 24, 2015 to December 31, 2015, included the impact of various discrete tax items, primarily related to an increase in tax expense resulting from non-deductible transaction costs associated with the merger of Cyberonics and Sorin and an increase in tax expense due to the change in the corporate income tax rate in Italy.\nU.S. Tax Reform\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act\u201d). The Act, which is also commonly referred to as U.S. tax reform\u201d, significantly changes U.S. corporate income tax laws by, among other things, reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21% commencing in 2018. In addition, the Act created a one-time mandatory tax, a toll charge, on previously deferred foreign earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries controlled by a U.S. corporation, or, in our case, a non-U.S. subsidiary controlled by one of our U.S. subsidiaries. We recorded no toll charge for the year ended December 31, 2017 as we had no previously deferred foreign earnings of U.S. controlled foreign subsidiaries as of the measurement dates. As a result of the Act, we recorded a non-cash net charge of $27.5 million during the fourth quarter of 2017, which is included in Income tax expense (benefit) in the consolidated statement of (loss) income. This amount primarily consists of two components: (i) $12.8 million relating to the impairment of foreign tax credits, and (ii) a net $14.7 million charge resulting from the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities in the U.S. based on the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate.\nThe Act also establishes various other new U.S. corporate income tax laws that will affect 2018, including, but not limited to, (1) elimination of the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT); (2) the creation of the base erosion anti-abuse tax (BEAT), a new minimum tax; (3) a new provision designed to tax global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI); (4) a new limitation on deductible interest expense; (5) the repeal of the domestic production activity deduction; (6) limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation; and (7) limitations on net operating losses (NOLs) generated after December 31, 2017, to 80 percent of taxable income. The extent to which these and other provisions of the Act, or future legislation or regulations, could impact our consolidated effective income tax rate in future periods depends on many factors including, but not limited to, the amount of profit generated by our subsidiaries operating in the U.S., the impact of the Company's current or contemplated tax planning strategies, the impact of new or amended tax laws or regulations by countries outside the U.S., and other factors beyond our control.\nFurther regulations and notices and state conformity could be issued as a result of U.S. tax reform covering various issues that may affect our tax position including, but not limited to, an increase in the corporate state tax rate and elimination of the interest deduction. The content of any future legislation, the timing for regulations, notices, and state conformity, and the reporting periods that would be impacted cannot be determined at this time. Although we believe the net charge of $27.5 million is a reasonable estimate of the impact of the income tax effects of the Act on LivaNova as of December 31, 2017, the estimate is provisional. Once we finalize certain tax positions for our 2017 U.S. consolidated tax return, we will be able to conclude whether any further adjustments to our tax positions are required.\nBrexit\nOn June 23, 2016, the UK held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit.\u201d On March 29, 2017, the UK government gave formal notice of its intention to leave the EU, formally commencing the negotiations regarding the terms of withdrawal between the UK and the EU. The withdrawal must occur within two years, unless the deadline is extended. The negotiation process will determine the future terms of the UK's relationship with the EU. The notification does not change the application of existing tax laws, and does not establish a clear framework for what the ultimate outcome of the negotiations and legislative process will be.\nVarious tax reliefs and exemptions that apply to transactions between EU Member States under existing tax laws may cease to apply to transactions between the UK and EU Member States when the UK ultimately withdraws from the EU. It is unclear at this stage if or when any new tax treaties between the UK and the EU or individual EU Member States will replace those reliefs and exemptions. It is also unclear at this stage what financial, trade and legal implications will ensue from Brexit and how Brexit may affect us, our customers, suppliers, vendors, or our industry.\nSeveral of our wholly owned subsidiaries that are domiciled either in the UK, various EU Member States, or in the United States, and our parent company, LivaNova PLC, are party to intercompany transactions and agreements under which we receive\nvarious tax reliefs and exemptions in accordance with applicable international tax laws, treaties and regulations. If certain treaties applicable to our transactions and agreements are not renegotiated or replaced with new treaties containing terms, conditions and attributes similar to those of the existing treaties, Brexit may have a material adverse impact on our future financial results and results of operations. During the two-year negotiation period, we will monitor and assess the potential impact of this event and explore possible tax-planning strategies that may mitigate or eliminate any such potential adverse impact. We will not account for the impact of Brexit in our income tax provisions until changes in tax laws or treaties between the UK and the EU or individual EU Member States with the UK and/or the U.S. are enacted or the withdrawal becomes effective.\nEuropean Union State Aid Challenge\nOn October 26, 2017, the European Commission ( EC\u201d) announced that an investigation will be opened with respect to the UK's controlled foreign company ( CFC\u201d) rules. The CFC rules under investigation provide certain tax exceptions to entities controlled by UK parent companies that are subject to lower tax rates if the activities being undertaken by the CFC relate to financing. The EC is investigating whether the exemption is a breach of EU State Aid rules. The investigation is in its early stages and is unlikely to be completed within the next twelve months with an appeal process likely to follow. It is unclear as to whether the UK will be part of the EU once a decision has been finalized due to Brexit and what impact, if any, Brexit will have on the outcome of the investigation or the enforceability of a decision. Due to the many uncertainties related to this matter, including the preliminary state of the investigation, the pending Brexit negotiations and political environment and the unknown outcome of the investigation and resulting appeals, no uncertain tax position reserve has been recognized related to this matter and we are unable to reasonably estimate the potential liability.\nEquity Method Investments\nLosses from equity method investments were $16.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 were due to investee losses of Highlife, MicroPort and Caisson and the impairment of our investment in, and notes receivable from Highlife of $13.0 million; consisting of investment impairment of $4.7 million and the notes receivable impairment of $8.3 million. In May 2017, we acquired the remaining equity interests in Caisson and we began consolidating the results of Caisson as of the acquisition date.\nWe recognized equity method losses of $18.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 due to investee losses of Caisson, Highlife, Microport and Respicardia and the impairment of our investment in Respicardia of $9.2 million. In November 2016, we terminated our distributor agreement with Respicardia. The distributor agreement had been a key component in the determination of whether our influence over Respicardia was significant, and as a result, we determined that we no longer had significant influence over Respicardia and transferred the investment to our cost method investments.\nWe recognized losses of $2.2 million from our share of investee losses at Highlife, Caisson, Respicardia and MicroPort during the equivalent prior period ended December 31, 2015. All the equity method investments were acquired in the Mergers and therefore investee losses were included in our consolidated statement of (loss) income in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K beginning October 19, 2015.\nResults of Discontinued Operations\nThe table below illustrates the results of discontinued operations (in thousands):\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Transitional Period April 25, 2015 to December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discontinued Operations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,271\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(64,663\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14,893\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of discontinued operations, net of tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(78,283\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss from discontinued operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(79,554\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(64,663\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14,893\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn November 20, 2017, we entered into a letter of intent ( LOI\u201d) to sell our CRM Business Franchise ( CRM\u201d) to MicroPort Scientific Corporation for $190.0 million in cash. Completion of the transaction is subject to receipt of relevant regulatory approvals, including fulfilling the requirements of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange's Major Transaction requirements, and other customary closing conditions. We expect the transaction to close in the second quarter of 2018.\nCRM develops, manufactures and markets products for the diagnosis, treatment and management of heart rhythm disorders and heart failures. CRM products include high-voltage defibrillators, cardiac resynchronization therapy devices and low-voltage pacemakers. CRM has approximately 900 employees, with operations in Clamart, France; Saluggia, Italy; and Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.\nWe concluded that the sale of CRM represents a strategic shift and therefore qualifies as a discontinued operation under GAAP. As a result, we classified the operating results of CRM as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of (loss) income. Additionally, we tested the long-lived assets of CRM for impairment and recognized an impairment to tangible and intangible assets of $78.3 million, net of a $15.3 million tax benefit. The assets and liabilities of CRM are classified as assets (or liabilities) of discontinued operations on the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSignificant Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates\nWe have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). Our most significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 2. Basis of Presentation, Use of Accounting Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the consolidated financial statements. New accounting pronouncements are disclosed in Note 21. New Accounting Pronouncements\u201d in the consolidated financial statements.\nTo prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of our consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. We consider estimates to be critical if we are required to make assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation, or if materially different estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period. The following are areas requiring management's judgment that we consider critical:\nBusiness Combinations\nWe allocate the amounts we pay for each acquisition to the assets we acquire and liabilities we assume based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition, including identifiable intangible assets and in-process research and development which either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill. We base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination, including in-process research and development, on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management, which consider management's best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use. We allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired to goodwill. Transaction costs associated with these acquisitions are expensed as incurred and are reported as operating expenses.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets shown on the consolidated balance sheet are finite-lived assets. Developed technology rights consist primarily of purchased patents, related know-how and licensed patent rights. Tradenames include the Sorin trade name acquired as part of the Mergers. Customer relationships consist of relationships with hospitals and physicians in the countries where we operate. We amortize our intangible assets over their useful lives using the straight-line method.\nAmortization expense for developed technology is recorded in research and development and cost of goods sold. When the product is marketed, we amortize the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset to cost of goods sold. Amortization expense for trade name and customer relationships is recorded in selling, general and administrative expense. We evaluate our intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances indicate either a different useful life or impairment. If we change our estimate of the useful life of an asset, we amortize the carrying amount over the revised remaining useful life.\nImpairment of Property and Equipment and Intangible Assets\nWe review, when circumstances warrant, the carrying amounts of our property and equipment and our intangible assets to determine whether such carrying amounts continue to be recoverable. Such changes in circumstance may include, among other items, (i) an expectation of a sale or disposal of a long-lived asset or asset group, (ii) adverse changes in market or competitive conditions, (iii) an adverse change in legal factors or business climate in the markets in which we operate and (iv) operating or cash flow losses. For purposes of impairment testing, long-lived assets are grouped at the lowest level for which cash flows are largely independent of other assets and liabilities, generally at or below the reporting unit level. If the carrying amount of the asset or asset group is greater than the expected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by such asset or asset group, an\nimpairment adjustment is recognized. Such adjustment is measured by the amount that the carrying value of such asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. We generally measure fair value by considering (a) sale prices for similar assets, (b) discounted estimated future cash flows using an appropriate discount rate and/or (c) estimated replacement cost. Assets to be disposed of are carried at the lower of their financial statement carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.\nWe evaluate the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually on October 1st and whenever other facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable. For impairment evaluations with respect to both goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles, we first make a qualitative assessment to determine if the goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible may be impaired. In the case of goodwill, if it is more-likely-than-not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value, we then compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its respective carrying amount. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a component\u201d). Our operating segments are deemed to be our reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit were to exceed its fair value, we would then compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill to its carrying amount, and any excess of the carrying amount over the fair value would be charged to operations as an impairment loss. With respect to indefinite-lived intangible assets, if it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, we then estimate its fair value and any excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is also charged to operations as an impairment loss.\nDerivatives\nU.S. GAAP requires companies to recognize all derivatives as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and to measure the instruments at fair value through earnings unless the derivative qualifies for hedge accounting. If the derivative qualifies for hedge accounting, depending on the nature of the hedge and hedge effectiveness, changes in the fair value of the derivative will either be recognized immediately in earnings or recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings upon settlement/termination. The changes in the fair value of the derivative are intended to offset the change in fair value of the hedged asset, liability or probable commitment. We evaluate hedge effectiveness at inception and on an ongoing basis. If a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued. Hedge ineffectiveness, if any, is recorded in earnings. Cash flows from derivative contracts are reported as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nWe use currency exchange rate derivative contracts and interest rate derivative instruments, to manage the impact of currency exchange and interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows. In order to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from currency exchange rate changes, we enter into derivative instruments, principally forward currency exchange rate contracts. These contracts are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions and changes in the value of specific assets and liabilities. At inception of the forward contract, the derivative is designated as either a freestanding derivative or a cash flow hedge. We do not enter into currency exchange rate derivative contracts for speculative purposes. All derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets, as financial asset or liabilities (current or non-current) depending upon the gain or loss position of the contract and contract maturity date.\nForward contracts designated as cash flow hedges are designed to hedge the variability of cash flows associated with forecasted transactions denominated in a foreign currency that will take place in the future. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into earnings to offset exchange differences originated by the hedged item or to adjust the value of operating income (expense).\nWe use freestanding derivative forward contracts to offset exposure to the variability of the value associated with assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency. These derivatives are not designated as hedges, and therefore changes in the value of these forward contracts are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related change in value of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.\nWe use interest rate derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges to manage the exposure to interest rate movements and to reduce the risk of an increase in borrowing costs by converting floating-rate debt into fixed-rate debt. Under these agreements, we agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to agreed-upon notional principal amounts. The interest rate swaps are structured to mirror the payment terms of the underlying loan. The fair value of the interest rate swaps is reported in the consolidated balance sheets financial assets or liabilities (current or non-current) depending upon the gain or loss position of the contract and the maturity of the future cash flows of the fair value of each contract. The effective portion of the gain or loss on these derivatives is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified to interest expense in the consolidated statement of (loss) income when the underlying position is settled. The non-effective portion is reported in interest expense in consolidated statement of (loss) income.\nCost and Equity Method Investments\nCertain of the Company's investments in equity and other securities are strategic investments in companies that are in varied stages of development. These investments are included in Investments on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company accounts for these investments under the cost or the equity method of accounting, as appropriate. The valuation of equity and other securities accounted for under the cost method considers all available financial information related to the investee, including valuations based on recent third-party equity investments in the investee. If an unrealized loss for any investment is considered to be other-than-temporary, the loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of income in the period the determination is made. Equity securities accounted for under the equity method are initially recorded at the amount of the Company's investment and are adjusted each period for the Company's share of the investee's income or loss and dividends paid. Equity securities accounted for under both the cost and equity methods are reviewed quarterly for changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events that suggest the Company's investment may not be recoverable.\nStock-Based Compensation\nOur stock option awards and stock appreciation rights compensation expense is based on the fair market value of our awards and is amortized ratably over the award vesting period. The fair market value is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing methodology at the grant date. This methodology takes into account variables such as the future expected volatility of our stock price, the amount of time expected to elapse between the date of grant and the date of exercise and a risk-free interest rate. Fair values of stock option awards and stock appreciation rights issued in the future may vary significantly from fair values of awards issued in the current period depending on our estimates, and judgments regarding these variables, and therefore expense in future periods, may differ significantly from current-period expense. Refer to Note 2. Basis of Presentation, Use of Accounting Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies\u201d accompanying the consolidated financial statements for further information related to key assumptions.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are a UK corporation, and we operate through our various subsidiaries in a number of countries throughout the world. Our provision for income taxes is based on the tax laws and rates applicable in the jurisdictions in which we operate and earn income. We use significant judgment and estimates in accounting for our income taxes. This involves assessing changes in temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of events for tax and accounting purposes. These assessments result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Actual tax expense may significantly differ from our expectations if, for example, judicial interpretations of tax law, tax regulations or tax rates change.\nWe file federal and local tax returns in many jurisdictions throughout the world and are subject to income tax examinations for our fiscal year 1992 and subsequent years, with certain exceptions. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes and as a result, we may establish reserves for uncertain tax positions, which require a significant degree of management judgment. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of our tax positions in order to determine the appropriateness of our reserves for uncertain tax positions; however, the actual outcome of an audit can be significantly different than our expectations, which could have a material impact on our tax provision. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefit, as of December 31, 2017, if recognized, would reduce our income tax expense by approximately $26.1 million.\nWe are required to periodically assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets by considering whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the actual benefit of those assets will be realized. To the extent that realization does not meet the more-likely-than-not\u201d criterion, we establish a valuation allowance. We periodically review the adequacy and necessity of the valuation allowance by considering significant positive and negative evidence relative to our ability to recover deferred tax assets and to determine the timing and amount of valuation allowance that should be released. Changes in our assessment of the factors related to the recoverability of our deferred tax assets could result in materially different income tax provisions. As of December 31, 2017, we had valuation allowances of $47.4 million that were primarily related to net operating losses in certain jurisdictions and U.S. tax credits. If these valuation allowances were to be released our tax expense would be reduced by $47.4 million.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into U.S. law which provided numerous amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act may impact our U.S. income tax expense (benefit) from continuing operations in future periods.\nForeign Currency\nOur functional currency is the U.S. dollar, however, a portion of the revenues earned and expenses incurred by certain of our subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We determine the functional currency of our subsidiaries\nthat exist and operate in different economic and currency environments based on the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates, that is, the currency of the environment in which an entity primarily generates and expends cash. Our significant foreign subsidiaries are located in Europe and the U.S. The functional currency of our significant European subsidiaries is the Euro and the functional currency of our significant U.S. subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar.\nAssets and liabilities for subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars based on a combination of both current and historical exchange rates, while their revenues earned and expenses incurred are translated into U.S. dollars at average period exchange rates. Translation adjustments are included as \u2018Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)' ( AOCI\u201d) in the consolidated balance sheets. Gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in a currency different from an entity's functional currency are included in Foreign exchange and other gains (losses) in our consolidated statements of income (loss). Taxes are not provided on cumulative translation adjustments, as substantially all translation adjustments are related to earnings which are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the countries where earned.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nBased on our current business plan, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and future cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our expected operating needs, working capital requirements, R&D opportunities, capital expenditures and debt service requirements over the next 12 months. We regularly review our capital needs and consider various investing and financing alternatives to support our requirements. Refer to Note 10. Financing Arrangements\u201d in the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our debt. Our liquidity could be adversely affected by the factors affecting future operating results, including those referred to in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d above.\nCash Flows\nNet cash and cash equivalents provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities and the net increase (decrease) in the balance of cash and cash equivalents were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Transitional Period April 25, 2015 to December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended April 24, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>91,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9,288\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79,676\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(52,855\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(44,516\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,765\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(118,039\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18,127\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(48,256\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,048\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(420\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(341\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(767\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (decreases) increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,826\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(72,824\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11,574\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 $91.3 million, primarily due to adjustments to net income of $220.0 million for non-cash items, which included a non-cash loss of $93.6 million related to the impairment of tangible and intangible assets of our discontinued operations, and depreciation and amortization of $82.9 million, offset by utilization of cash for operating assets and liabilities of $103.6 million.\nCash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $90.2 million, primarily due to a net loss of $62.8 million offset by $161.3 million of non-cash items. Non-cash items were principally composed of $85.4 million in depreciation and amortization and $19.6 million in stock-based compensation.\nDuring the transitional period April 25, 2015 to December 31, 2015, cash utilized in operating activities was $9.3 million, which was net of amortization of $36.3 million related to Sorin's inventory written-up in the Mergers. In connection with the Mergers we acquired $233.8 million of Sorin inventory as of October 19, 2015. In addition, we utilized operating cash for payment of accrued merger costs, which primarily accounted for the decrease in our balance of accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $32.8 million.\nCash provided by operating activities for the historical Cyberonics fiscal year ended April 24, 2015 was $79.7 million, which was primarily attributable to net income of $57.8 million and non-cash operating expense and FX losses of $28.2 million, offset by $6.3 million utilized by operating assets and liabilities, primarily to build inventories.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities was $52.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. We invested $34.1 million in property, plant and equipment. We also utilized cash of $27.9 million related to our investments in privately held medical start-up companies, which included the purchase of the 51% of the remaining interest in Caisson utilizing cash of $14.2 million, and investments in, and loans to, our equity and cost method investees of $13.7 million.\nCash used in investing activities was $44.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to $38.4 million invested in property, plant and equipment and investments in, and loans to, our equity and cost method investees of $14.3 million. These amounts were partially offset by the transfer of $7.0 million to cash and cash equivalents from short-term investments.\nCash provided in investing activities of $16.2 million during the transitional period April 25, 2015 to December 31, 2015 was due to the transfer of $20.0 million to cash and cash equivalents from short-term investments and an increase in cash of $12.5 million obtained in the Mergers, offset by net investment activity of $16.3 million, primarily for property, plant and equipment.\nCash used in investing activities was $9.8 million during the fiscal year ended April 24, 2015. We invested $1.9 million in commercial paper. We also invested $6.7 million in property, plant and equipment primarily due to construction of the Costa Rica manufacturing facility. We also invested $1.2 million in Cerbomed, which was fully impaired during the transitional period April 25, 2015 to December 31, 2015.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 was $11.3 million, which includes $32.4 million in borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and repayment of long-term debt of $22.8 million. We also borrowed $2.0 million in additional long-term debt.\nCash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 was $118.0 million, which includes $54.5 million to repurchase shares, a $33.7 million reduction in revolving credit facilities, repayment of advances on customer receivables of $23.8 million and repayment of long-term debt of $21.1 million. We also borrowed $7.2 million in additional long-term debt.\nCash used in financing activities during the transitional period April 25, 2015 to December 31, 2015 was $18.1 million, which included the repayment of long-term debt of $32.0 million, and the purchase of treasury shares for $7.3 million, partially offset by cash proceeds from net short-term debt borrowing of $11.1 million and stock based compensation activities of $8.8 million.\nCash used in financing activities during the year ended April 24, 2015 was $48.3 million, which was primarily due to stock repurchases of $55.0 million.\nDebt and Capital\nOur capital structure consists of debt and equity. As of December 31, 2017, our total debt of $146 million was 8.0% of total equity of $1.8 billion. As of December 31, 2016, our total debt of $123 million was 7.2% of total equity of $1.7 billion.\nDebt Acquired in the Mergers\nAt the consummation of the Mergers on October 19, 2015, LivaNova acquired all of the outstanding debt of Sorin in the aggregate principal amount of $203.0 million payable to various financial and non-financial institutions. Prior to the Mergers Cyberonics had no debt.\nDebt - Post Mergers\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we increased our outstanding revolving credit facilities by $32.4 million, repaid $22.8 million of long-term debt obligations and borrowed $2.0 million in additional long-term debt.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we reduced our outstanding revolving credit facilities by $33.7 million, repaid $21.1 million of long-term debt obligations and borrowed $7.2 million in additional long-term debt.\nFactoring\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we reduced our obligation for advances on customer receivables by $23.8 million, thereby eliminating this form of financing.\nContractual Obligations\nWe have various contractual commitments that we expect to fund from existing cash, future operating cash flows and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. The actual timing of the clinical commitment payments may vary based on the completion of milestones which are beyond our control. The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 and the periods in which such obligations are due (in thousands):\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less Than One Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>One to Three Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Three to Five Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Contractual Obligations\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal payments on short-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal payments on long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,844\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,793\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments on long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>788\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>848\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Caisson deferred consideration\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventory supply contract obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Derivative instruments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>588\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>502\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>116,724\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>92,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,490\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>262,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Contractual obligations do not include $26.1 million of unrecognized tax benefits, inclusive of interest and penalties, included on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017. We are unable to specify with certainty the future periods in which we may be obligated to settle such amounts.  We have other commitments that we are contractually obligated to fulfill with cash under certain circumstances. These commitments include letters of credit to guarantee our performance as it relates to our contract bidding, VAT tax, tax appeals, and other obligations in various jurisdictions. Obligations under these guarantees are not normally called, as we typically comply with underlying performance requirements. As of December 31, 2017, no liability has been recorded in the financial statements associated with these obligations.\nThe following table summarizes our guarantees as of December 31, 2017 (in thousands):\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less Than One Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>One to Three Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Three to Five Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Guarantees\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Guarantees on governmental bids (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>863\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Guarantees - commercial (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>962\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>481\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Guarantees to tax authorities (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>242\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,833\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Guarantees to third-parties (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>153\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total guarantees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,649\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,293\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Government bid guarantees include such items as unconditional bank guarantees, irrevocable letters of credit and bid bonds. \n (2) Commercial guarantees include our lease and tenancy guarantees. \n (3) The guarantees to the governmental tax authorities consist primarily of the guarantee issued to the Italian VAT Authority. \n (4) Guarantees to third-parties consist primarily of irrevocable letters of credit and tenancy guarantees. \nMarket Risk\nWe are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations, including risks from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rate risks and concentration of procurement suppliers that could adversely affect our consolidated balance sheets, net (loss) income and cash flow.\nWe manage these risks through regular operating and financing activities and, at certain times, derivative financial instruments.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nDue to the global nature of our operations, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We maintain a foreign currency exchange rate risk management strategy that utilizes derivatives to reduce our exposure to unanticipated fluctuations in forecast revenue and costs and fair values of debt, inter-company debt and accounts receivables caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nWe mitigate our credit risk relating to counter-parties of our derivatives through a variety of techniques, including transacting with multiple, high-quality financial institutions, thereby limiting our exposure to individual counter-parties and by entering into International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. ( ISDA\u201d) Master Agreements, which include provisions for a legally enforceable master netting agreement, with almost all of our derivative counter-parties. The terms of the ISDA agreements may also include credit support requirements, cross default provisions, termination events, or set-off provisions. Legally enforceable master netting agreements reduce credit risk by providing protection in bankruptcy in certain circumstances and generally permitting the closeout and netting of transactions with the same counter-party upon the occurrence of certain events.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are subject to interest rate risk on our investments and debt. We manage a portion of our interest rate risk with contracts that swap floating-rate interest payments for fixed rate interest payments. If interest rates were to increase or decrease by 0.5%, the effects on our consolidated statement of (loss) income would not be material.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nOur trade accounts receivable represent potential concentrations of credit risk. This risk is limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across a number of geographic areas, as well as our efforts to control our exposure to credit risk by monitoring our receivables and the use of credit approvals and credit limits. In addition, we have historically had strong collections and minimal write-offs. While we believe that our reserves for credit losses are adequate, essentially all of our trade receivables are concentrated in the hospital and healthcare sectors worldwide, and accordingly, we are exposed to their respective business, economic and country-specific variables. Although we do not currently foresee a concentrated credit risk associated with these receivables, repayment is dependent on the financial stability of these industry sectors and the respective countries' national economies and healthcare systems.\nFactors Affecting Future Operating Results and Share Price\nThe factors affecting our future operating results and share prices are disclosed in Item 1A.

Discontinued Operations to the Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBackground and the Mergers\nHeadquartered in London, LivaNova PLC (collectively with its subsidiaries, the Company\u201d, LivaNova\u201d, we\u201d or our\u201d) was organized under the laws of England and Wales on February 20, 2015 for the purpose of facilitating the business combination of Cyberonics, Inc., a Delaware corporation ( Cyberonics\u201d) and Sorin S.p.A., a joint stock company organized under the laws of Italy ( Sorin\u201d). As a result of the business combination, we became the holding company of the combined businesses of Cyberonics and Sorin. This business combination (the Mergers\u201d) became effective on October 19, 2015, at which time our shares were listed for trading on the NASDAQ Global Market ( NASDAQ\u201d) and on the London Stock Exchange (the LSE\u201d) as a standard listing under the trading symbol LIVN.\u201d Upon the consummation of the Mergers, the historical financial statements of Cyberonics became the Company's historical financial statements. Accordingly, the historical financial statements of Cyberonics are included in the comparative prior periods. For further information regarding the acquisition, refer to Note 3. Business Combinations\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBusiness Franchises\nLivaNova is comprised of two principal Business Franchises: Cardiac Surgery and Neuromodulation, corresponding to our main therapeutic areas. Corporate activities include corporate business development and New Ventures. New Ventures is focused on new growth platforms and identification of other opportunities for expansion.\nCardiac Surgery Update\nOur Cardiac Surgery Business Franchise ( CS\u201d) is engaged in the development, production and sale of cardiac surgery products, including oxygenators, heart-lung machines, perfusion tubing systems, cannulae and other accessories used for extracorporeal circulation, systems for autologous blood transfusion and blood washing, as well as a complete line of surgical tissue and mechanical heart valve replacements and repair products.\nResearch and Development updates\nIn October 2015, we announced the initiation of PERSIST-AVR, the first international, prospective post-market randomized multi-center clinical study evaluating the Perceval sutureless aortic valve compared to standard sutured bioprostheses in patients with aortic valve disease. The Perceval valve, the only sutureless biological aortic valve replacement ( AVR\u201d) on the market today, employs a unique self-anchoring frame that enables the surgeon to replace the diseased valve without suturing it into place. The study is expected to enroll 1,234 patients within a two-year enrollment period and patients will be followed until five years post procedure. In January 2017, the independent study, Aortic Valve Replacement With Sutureless Perceval Bioprosthesis: Single-Center Experience With 617 Implants,\u201d was presented to The Society of Thoracic Surgeons. The study found AVR procedures conducted with the Perceval sutureless valve resulted in low mortality and excellent hemodynamic performance for patients.\nCardiopulmonary product updates\nIn September 2017, we received FDA 510(k) clearance for the U.S. market launch of our Optiflow Arterial Cannulae Family. Optiflow aortic arch cannulae provide improved hydrodynamics with a novel dispersive tip design that improves blood flow characteristics resulting in reduced wall shear stress ( WSS\u201d) profiles. Optiflow Arterial cannulae feature a unique basket tip with large openings that allow a more physiologically compatible dispersive design. This design has been shown to significantly reduce WSS and turbulence, thereby improving hydrodynamics and potentially reducing ischemic complications from extracorporeal circulation during cardiac surgery.\nFDA Warning Letter\nOn December 29, 2015, the FDA issued a Warning Letter (the Warning Letter\u201d) alleging certain violations of FDA regulations applicable to medical device manufacturers at our Munich, Germany and Arvada, Colorado facilities. Among other things, the Warning Letter stated that our 3T devices and other devices we manufactured at our Munich facility are subject to refusal of admission into the U.S. until resolution of the issues set forth by the FDA in the Warning Letter. The FDA has informed us that the import alert is limited to the 3T devices, but that the agency reserves the right to expand the scope of the import alert if future circumstances warrant such action. The Warning Letter did not request that existing users cease using the 3T device, and manufacturing and shipment of all of our products other than the 3T device remain unaffected by the import limitation. To help clarify these issues for current customers, we issued an informational Customer Letter in January 2016, and that same month agreed with the FDA on a process for shipping 3T devices to existing U.S. users pursuant to a certificate of medical necessity program. We continue to work diligently to remediate the FDA's inspectional observations for the Munich facility, as well as the additional issues identified in the Warning Letter. For further information, please refer to Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCDC and FDA Safety Communications and Company Field Safety Notice Update\nOn October 13, 2016 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC\u201d) and FDA separately released safety notifications regarding the 3T devices. The CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report ( MMWR\u201d) and Health Advisory Notice ( HAN\u201d) reported that tests conducted by CDC and its affiliates indicate that there appears to be genetic similarity between both patient and 3T device strains of the non-tuberculous mycobacterium ( NTM\u201d) bacteria M. chimaera isolated in hospitals in Iowa and Pennsylvania. Citing the geographic separation between the two hospitals referenced in the investigation, the report asserts that 3T devices manufactured prior to August 18, 2014 could have been contaminated during the manufacturing process. The CDC's HAN and FDA's Safety Communication, issued contemporaneously with the MMWR report, each assess certain risks associated with 3T devices and provide guidance for providers and patients. On October 13, 2016, we issued a Field Safety Notice Update for U.S. users of 3T devices to proactively and voluntarily contact facilities to aid in implementation of the CDC and FDA recommendations. For further information, please refer to Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nProduct Remediation Plan\nIn response to the Warning Letter and CDC's HAN and FDA's Safety Commission, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we initiated a program to provide existing 3T device users with a new loaner 3T device at no charge pending regulatory approval and implementation of additional risk mitigation strategies worldwide. This loaner program began in the U.S. and is being made available progressively on a global basis, prioritizing and allocating devices to 3T device users based on pre-established criteria. We anticipate that this program will continue until we are able to address customer needs through a broader solution that includes implementation of one or more of the risk mitigation strategies currently under review with regulatory agencies. We are also currently implementing a vacuum and sealing upgrade program in as many countries as possible throughout 2018 and beyond until all devices are upgraded. Furthermore, we intend to perform a no-charge deep disinfection service for 3T device users who have reported confirmed M. chimaera mycobacterium contamination. Although the deep disinfection service is not yet available in the U.S., it is currently offered in many countries around the world and will be expanded to additional geographies as we receive the required regulatory approvals.\nOn December 31, 2016, we recognized a liability for our product remediation plan related to our 3T device. We concluded that it was probable that a liability had been incurred upon management's approval of the plan and the commitments made by management to various regulatory authorities globally in November and December 2016, and furthermore, the cost associated with the plan was reasonably estimable. At December 31, 2017, the product remediation liability was $27.5 million. Refer to Note 6. Product Remediation Liability\u201d for additional information.\nHeart Valve product updates\nIn January 2016, we announced FDA approval of the Perceval sutureless valve. While we have been selling Perceval in other parts of the world for several years, we began commercial distribution of the device in the United States last year, with the first\nimplant announced on March 8, 2016. The Perceval valve has been implanted in more than 25,000 patients in more than 310 hospitals in 34 countries across the world.\nIn early February 2016, we announced that we received FDA approval of our CROWN PRT valve for the treatment of aortic valve disease. The CROWN PRT valve uses a stented aortic bioprosthesis technology and features a surgeon-friendly design, with optimized hemodynamics and a patented phospholipid reduction treatment ( PRT\u201d), designed to enhance valve durability. We launched the CROWN PRT valve in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016.\nSale of our Suzhou Industrial Park facility in Shanghai, China\nIn March 2017, we committed to a plan to sell our Suzhou Industrial Park facility in Shanghai, China, an emerging market greenfield project for the local manufacture of Cardiopulmonary disposable products in Suzhou Industrial Park in China. As a result of this exit plan, we recorded an impairment of the building and equipment of $5.4 million and accrued $0.5 million of additional costs, primarily related to employee severance, during the year ended December 31, 2017, included in \u2018Restructuring expenses' in the consolidated statement of (loss) income. In addition, the land, building and equipment were recorded as Assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet, with a carrying value of $13.6 million as of December 31, 2017. In December, 2017, we executed a letter of intent for the sale of the Suzhou facility.\nNeuromodulation Update\nThe Neuromodulation segment designs, develops and markets neuromodulation therapy for the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy and treatment resistant depression. Through this segment, we market our proprietary implantable VNS Therapy\u00ae Systems that deliver vagus nerve stimulation therapy for the treatment of epilepsy and depression.\nResearch and Development updates\nOur product development efforts are directed toward improving the VNS Therapy System and developing new products that provide additional features and functionality. We are conducting ongoing product development activities to enhance the VNS Therapy System pulse generator, lead and programming software. We support studies for our product development efforts and to build clinical evidence for the VNS Therapy System. We will be required to obtain appropriate U.S. and international regulatory approvals, and clinical studies may be a prerequisite to regulatory approvals for some products. Our research and development ( R&D\u201d) efforts will require significant funding to complete and may not be successful. Even if successful, additional clinical studies may be needed to achieve regulatory approval and to commercialize any or all new or improved products. Several development projects were either terminated or halted during year ended December 31, 2016. We made the decision to focus our efforts on projects we believe have a strong likelihood of meeting both patient and physician needs in the near term.\nProduct updates\nEpilepsy\nIn October 2017, we obtained FDA approval to market our SenTiva VNS Therapy System, which consists of the SenTiva implantable generator and the next-generation VNS Therapy Programming System. SenTiva is the smallest and lightest responsive therapy for epilepsy. The new VNS Therapy Programming System features a wireless wand and new user interface on a small tablet. Together, these components offer patients with drug-resistant epilepsy a physician-directed, customizable therapy with smart technology that reduces the number of seizures, lessens the duration of seizures and enables a faster recovery.\nIn June 2017, the FDA approved our VNS Therapy device for use in patients who are at least four years of age and have partial onset seizures that are refractory to antiepileptic medications. VNS Therapy is the first and only FDA-approved device for drug-resistant epilepsy in this pediatric population. Previously, VNS Therapy was approved by the FDA for patients 12 years or older.\nIn addition, in June 2017, we received FDA approval, and in August 2017, we received CE Mark approval, for our VNS Therapy device for expanded magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI\u201d) labeling affirming VNS Therapy as the only epilepsy device approved by the FDA for MRI scans. Currently, SenTiva, AspireHC and AspireSR models of VNS Therapy technology provide for this expanded MRI access.\nDepression\nIn March 2017, the American Journal of Psychiatry published the results of the longest and largest naturalistic study on effective treatments for patients experiencing chronic and severe depression. The findings showed that the addition of VNS Therapy to traditional treatment methods is effective in reducing symptoms in patients with treatment-resistant depression.\nCosta Rica Manufacturing plant closure\nIn October 2016, management initiated a plan to exit the Costa Rica manufacturing operations and transfer those activities to Houston, Texas. We recorded an impairment of the building and equipment of $5.7 million in fiscal year 2016, which was included in \u2018Restructuring expenses' in the consolidated statement of (loss) income. In addition, the carrying value of $4.5 million for the land and building after impairment was reclassified as Assets held for sale and were included in \u2018Other current assets' in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016. We completed the sale of the Costa Rica facility during the year ended December 31, 2017 and received $4.9 million in proceeds from the sale.\nCorporate Activities and New Ventures\nCorporate activities include shared services for finance, legal, human resources and information technology, corporate business development and New Ventures. New Ventures is focused on new growth platforms and identification of other opportunities for expansion.\nHeart failure\nWith respect to heart failure, New Ventures is focused on the development and clinical testing of the VITARIA System for treating heart failure through vagus nerve stimulation.\nWe received CE Mark approval of the VITARIA System in February 2015 for patients who have moderate to severe heart failure (New York Heart Association Class II/III) with left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction < 40%) and who remain symptomatic despite stable, optimal heart failure drug therapy. The VITARIA System provides a specific method of VNS called autonomic regulation therapy ( ART\u201d), and it includes the same elements as the VNS Therapy System. We conducted a pilot study, ANTHEM-HF, outside the United States, which concluded in 2014. The study results support the safety and efficacy of ART delivered by the VITARIA System. The VITARIA System is not approved in the U.S. During 2014, we also initiated a second pilot study, ANTHEM-HFpEF, to study ART in patients experiencing symptomatic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. This pilot study is currently underway outside the United States.\nSleep Apnea\nIn October 2014, Sorin invested $20.0 million in Respicardia, a U.S.-based developer of implantable therapies designed to improve Respiratory Rhythm Management and cardiovascular health. Respicardia's remed\u0113\u00ae System is an implantable device system designed to restore a more natural breathing pattern during sleep in patients with central sleep apnea (CSA) by transvenously stimulating the phrenic nerve. The remed\u0113 System received CE Mark certification in 2010 and in October 2017, Respicardia received U.S. FDA market approval. In September 2016, we elected not to exercise our option to purchase the outstanding shares of Respicardia as the investment no longer met our objective for substantial ongoing involvement taken into consideration with our overall portfolio management program. As a result, in September 2016 we recorded an impairment of $9.2 million equal to the amount of the carrying value of the option. In addition, we terminated our exclusive distribution agreement with Respicardia in November 2016. In December 2017, certain factors, including an additional round of external financing with a new investor, indicated that the carrying value of our investment might not be recoverable and the decrease in value of our investment was other than temporary. Our estimate of the fair value of our investment using the income approach resulted below our carrying value and as a result, we recorded an additional impairment of $5.5 million. This impairment was recorded in \u2018Impairment of cost-method investments' in our consolidated statement of (loss) income.\nWe have invested in ImThera Medical, Inc. ( ImThera\u201d), a privately held, emerging-growth company developing an implantable neurostimulation device system for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA\u201d) since 2011. On January 16, 2018 we acquired the remaining 86% outstanding interests in ImThera for up to approximately $225 million. Up-front costs are approximately $78 million with the balance paid on a schedule driven by regulatory and sales milestones. Headquartered in San Diego, California, ImThera manufactures an implantable device that stimulates multiple tongue muscles via the hypoglossal nerve, which opens the airway while a patient is sleeping. The ImThera device is highly aligned with our Neuromodulation Business Franchise. ImThera has a commercial presence in the European market, while we will be advancing ImThera's enrollment in an FDA pivotal study. We expect to submit pivotal trial results to the FDA towards the end of 2019 or in early 2020.\nMitral Valve Regurgitation\nMitral regurgitation ( MR\u201d) occurs when the heart's mitral valve does not close tightly, which allows blood to flow backwards in the heart. This reduces the amount of blood that flows to the rest of the body, making the patient feel tired or out of breath. Treatment depends on the nature and the severity of MR. In certain cases, heart surgery may be needed to repair or replace the valve. Left untreated, severe MR can cause heart failure or heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias).\nCaisson Interventional, LLC ( Caisson\u201d) is a clinical-stage medical device company based in Maple Grove, Minnesota and is focused on the design, development and clinical evaluation of a novel transcatheter mitral valve replacement ( TMVR\u201d) implant device with a fully transvenous delivery system for the treatment of mitral regurgitation. On May 2, 2017, we acquired the remaining 51% outstanding equity interests in Caisson for a purchase price of up to $72.0 million, in support of our strategic growth initiatives. As a result of our acquisition of Caisson, we began consolidating the results of Caisson as of May 2, 2017. In April 2016, Caisson obtained FDA approval of an Investigational Device Exemption study using its technology for treating mitral regurgitation heart failure with transcatheter mitral valve replacement and we are currently executing against a defined clinical data development plan designed to enable commercialization of the Caisson technology.\nWe are also invested in two mitral valve startups. Cardiosolutions Inc. ( Cardiosolutions\u201d) and Highlife S.A.S. ( Highlife\u201d). Cardiosolutions, a startup headquartered in the U.S. in which we have held an interest since 2012, is developing an innovative spacer technology for treating mitral regurgitation. Highlife, headquartered in France, is focused on developing devices for treating mitral regurgitation through percutaneous replacement of the native mitral valve. We recognized an impairment of our equity method investment in, and notes receivable from, Highlife during the year ended December 31, 2017, due to certain factors including a revision in our investment strategy that indicated that the carrying value of our aggregate investment might not be recoverable and that the decrease in value of our aggregate investment was other than temporary. We, therefore, estimated the fair value of our investment and notes receivable using the market approach and recorded an aggregate impairment of $13.0 million.\nResults of Continuing Operations\nThe merger of Cyberonics and Sorin on October 19, 2015 was considered a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting, with Cyberonics considered the acquirer of Sorin. As a result, Sorin's assets and liabilities were combined at their estimated fair values. In addition, LivaNova became the holding company of the combined businesses of Cyberonics and Sorin and the successor\u201d company to Cyberonics for accounting and Exchange Act reporting purposes.\nUnderstanding Our Financial Information\nIn this Annual Report on Form 10-K, LivaNova, as the successor company to Cyberonics, is reporting (in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States) the results for:\n \u2022 LivaNova and its consolidated subsidiaries for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. \n \u2022 A transitional period, April 25, 2015 to December 31, 2015, filed on Form 10-K/T. This transitional report is the result of the change from Cyberonics' fiscal year ending the last Friday in April before the Mergers to a calendar year ending December 31st after the Mergers. The transitional period included the business activities of Cyberonics and its consolidated subsidiaries for the period April 25, 2015 to October 18, 2015, and the consolidated results of the combined businesses of LivaNova (Cyberonics and Sorin) for the period October 19, 2015 to December 31, 2015. \n \u2022 LivaNova is also reporting the historical results of Cyberonics and its consolidated subsidiaries for the fiscal year ended April 24, 2015.  The transitional period, April 25, 2015 to December 31, 2015, as described above, impacts the comparability of the revenues, cost of sales and expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, and as such, we have provided an unaudited equivalent prior period consisting of business activity for the period January 24, 2015 to December 31, 2015. The unaudited equivalent prior period included the transitional period April 25, 2015 to December 31, 2015, and the unaudited Cyberonics fourth quarter data from the fiscal year ended April 24, 2015, or January 24, 2015 to April 24, 2015. The equivalent prior period has 18 fewer working days than the year ended December 31, 2016 and 17 working days fewer than the year ended December 31, 2017.\nIn addition, amortization expense of $7.7 million and $1.0 million for the transitional period April 25, 2015 to December 31, 2015, and the prior fiscal year ended April 24, 2015, respectively, was reclassified on the consolidated statements of income (loss) in order to conform with the presentation for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Amortization was reclassified from Cost of sales, selling, general and administrative and research and development and reported separately on the consolidated statements of income (loss).\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated results for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the equivalent prior period January 24, 2015 to December 31, 2015, and the fiscal year ended April 24, 2015 (in thousands):\n\nNet Sales\nThe table below illustrates net sales by operating segment and market geography (in thousands, except for percentages):\n\n (1) Includes those countries in Europe where LivaNova has a direct sales presence. Countries where sales are made through distributors are included in \u2018Rest of world'.  The table below illustrates segment income from continuing operations (in thousands):\n\n (1) For a reconciliation of segment income from continuing operations to our consolidated continuing operating income, refer to Note 18. Geographic and Segment Information\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, except for the Equivalent Prior Period January 24, 2015 to December 31, 2015, which includes the period January 24, 2015 to April 24, 2015, as compared to the Transitional period April 25, 2015 to December 31, 2015 used in the consolidated financial statements.  Cardiac Surgery\nCardiac Surgery net sales increased $23.8 million, or 3.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 due primarily to growth of $22.9 million in cardiopulmonary product revenue. Cardiopulmonary product sales increased year over year due to continued progress towards upgrading customers from our S3 heart-lung machines to our current S5 device, strong sales of our Inspire oxygenator and favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Heart valve sales increased by $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, due to favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which more than offset continuing global declines in traditional tissue and mechanical heart valves.\nCardiac Surgery operating income increased by $64.4 million or the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily driven by increased sales of $23.8 million combined with inventory fair value step-up amortization of $25.2 million that was recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The inventory fair value step-up was fully amortized by September 30, 2016.\nCardiac Surgery net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the equivalent prior period January 24, 2015 to December 31, 2015 increased by 314.3% because sales in the prior equivalent period were limited to the period October 19, 2015 (acquisition date for the Mergers) through December 31, 2015. Additionally, Cardiac Surgery operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the equivalent prior period January 24, 2015 to December 31, 2015 increased by 26.6% due to the acquisition date for the Mergers.\nNeuromodulation\nNeuromodulation net sales increased $23.6 million, or 6.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the prior year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to strong demand for the AspireSR VNS Therapy System and the launch of the SenTiva VNS Therapy System in October 2017.\nThe increase in Neuromodulation operating income for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior-year period, was primarily driven by increased operating leverage as a result of higher net sales, partially offset by the increased costs associated with sales force expansion and marketing efforts in the U.S.\nNeuromodulation net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $62.6 million, or 21.7%, as compared to the equivalent prior period January 24, 2015 to December 31, 2015, due primarily to pricing increases in the U.S. and to 17 fewer working days in the equivalent prior period.\nNeuromodulation operating income increased $61.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the equivalent prior period January 24, 2015 to December 31, 2015, due primarily to reporting corporate and intangible amortization expense for Cyberonics prior to the Mergers as Neuromodulation Business Franchise expenses rather than as \u2018Other' expenses.\nCost of Sales and Expenses\nThe table below illustrates our cost of sales and major expenses as a percentage of net sales:\n\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales consisted primarily of direct labor, allocated manufacturing overhead, the acquisition cost of raw materials and components.\nCost of sales as a percentage of net sales was 34.9% for the year ended December 31, 2017; a decrease of 3.2% as compared to the prior year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was due to the decrease in amortization of inventory written-up in the Mergers related to the Cardiac Surgery Segment of $25.2 million, which accounted for 2.6% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nCost of sales as a percentage of net sales was 38.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016; an increase of 10.4% as compared to the equivalent period ended December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily due to the inclusion of Sorin's Cardiac Surgery Business Franchise activities for the full year in 2016 as compared to its inclusion in the prior equivalent period for October 19, 2015 (acquisition date for the Mergers) through December 31, 2015.\nSelling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d) Expenses\nSG&A expenses are comprised of sales, marketing, general and administrative activities. SG&A expenses exclude expenses incurred in connection with the merger between Cyberonics and Sorin, integration costs after the Mergers and restructuring costs under the Restructuring Plans initiated after the Mergers.\nSG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 0.6% to 37.6% as compared to the prior year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was largely attributable to litigation related to our 3T devices, costs associated with acquisitions and other legal matters.\nSG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased 3.4% to 37.0% as compared to the equivalent prior period ended December 31, 2015. This reduction was due to our integration and re-organization efforts that capitalized on synergies between Cyberonics and Sorin's Cardiac Surgery segment.\nResearch and Development ( R&D\u201d) Expenses\nR&D expenses consist of product design and development efforts, clinical study programs and regulatory activities, which are essential to the Company's strategic portfolio initiatives, including TMVR, Treatment Resistant Depression and Heart Failure.\nR&D expenses as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by 2.3% to 10.8% as compared to the prior year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Caisson in May 2017, inclusive of $5.8 million in post-combination compensation expense recognized concurrent with the acquisition of Caisson, and $7.2 million in compensation expense associated with the retention of the employees of Caisson. The additional increase as compared to the prior year was due to increased investment in clinical and registries pertaining to TMVR and Heart Failure.\nR&D expenses as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased by 3.5% to 8.5% as compared to the prior equivalent period ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily due to completion of work, adaption to longer developmental schedules or cancellation of work in 2016.\nMerger and Integration Expenses\nMerger and integration expenses consisted primarily of consulting costs associated with computer systems integration efforts, organization structure integration, synergy and tax planning, as well as the integration of internal controls for the two legacy organizations. In addition, integration expenses include retention bonuses, branding and renaming efforts and lease cancellation penalties in Milan and Brussels.\nMerger and integration expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 1.5% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared 2.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016, and 14.7% for the equivalent period ended December 31, 2015, due to the continued decline in integration activities associated with the Mergers.\nRestructuring Expenses\nOur restructuring plans (the Plans\u201d) leverage economies of scale, eliminate duplicate corporate expenses and streamline distributions, logistics and office functions in order to reduce overall costs. Restructuring expenses are detailed in Note 5. Restructuring Plans\u201d in the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our 2015 and 2016 Reorganization Plans (the Plans\u201d) were initiated October 2015 and March 2016, respectively, in conjunction with the completion of the Mergers. The Plans included the Costa Rica manufacturing operation exit plan, initiated in December 2016 and completed during 2017, and the Suzhou, China exit plan, initiated in March 2017.\nRestructuring expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 1.7% from 3.9% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 as our restructuring activities declined and continue to decline. For the equivalent period ended December 31, 2015, restructuring expenses were 2.4% as a percentage of net sales.\nAmortization of Intangibles\nAmortization of intangibles includes the amortization of finite-lived intangible assets, primarily intellectual property and customer relationships, acquired at fair value in the Mergers in October 2015. Amortization of intangibles does not include amortization of the step-up of inventory to fair value at the Mergers, which was reported as a component of cost of sales. Prior to the Mergers, Cyberonics' intangible asset amortization was primarily related to intellectual property utilized in R&D activities.\nInterest Expense\nWe incurred interest expense of $7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due a reduction in income tax related interest expense for our inter-company sale of intellectual property for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior year as a result of a reduction in the income tax liability. We incurred interest expense of $1.5 million for the equivalent prior period January 24, 2015 to December 31, 2015 based on third-party debt acquired in the Mergers on October 19, 2015 .\nGain on Caisson Acquisition\nOn May 2, 2017, we acquired the remaining 51% equity interests in Caisson, which we previously accounted for under the equity method. On the acquisition date, we remeasured our notes receivable due from Caisson and our existing investment in Caisson at fair value and recognized a pre-tax non-cash gain of $1.3 million and $38.1 million, respectively.\nImpairment of Cost-Method Investments\nDuring December 2017, we impaired our cost-method investments in Respicardia and Rainbow Medical, in the amounts of $5.5 million and $3.0 million, respectively. Refer to Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDuring the equivalent prior period January 24, 2015 to December 31, 2015, we fully impaired our cost-method investment in Cerbomed, a European company developing a t-VNS device for epilepsy treatment, for a loss of $5.1 million.\nForeign Exchange ( FX\u201d) and Other\nDue to the global nature of our continuing operations, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Foreign exchange and other gains were $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, consisting of net FX losses of $2.1 million associated with intercompany debt and third-party financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, net of the impact of foreign currency derivative contracts established to hedge against exchange rate movements, offset by a $3.2 million gain on a sale of the cost-method investment, Istituto Europeo di Oncologia S.R.L.\nForeign Exchange and Other consisted of net FX gains of $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily the result of our inter-company financing arrangements, and third-party financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, net of the impact of foreign currency derivative contracts established to hedge against exchange rate movements.\nForeign Exchange and Other consisted of net FX losses of $7.5 million for the equivalent prior period ended December 31, 2015, which included a loss of $5.6 million from foreign currency derivative contracts established to hedge against exchange rate movements on the loan from the European Investment Bank and other loans. The loss on the hedge was recorded in our consolidated statements of income (loss), whereas the hedged instruments' gains were recorded in comprehensive income in our consolidated financial statements.\nIncome Taxes\nLivaNova PLC is domiciled and resident in the UK. Our subsidiaries conduct operations and earn income in numerous countries and are subject to the laws of taxing jurisdictions within those countries, and the income tax rates imposed in the tax jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries conduct operations vary. As a result of the changes in the overall level of our income, the deployment of various tax strategies and the changes in tax laws, our consolidated effective income tax rate may vary from one reporting period to another.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we recorded income tax expense from continuing operations of $50.0 million and $5.1 million, respectively, with effective income tax rates of 41.2% and 19.9%, respectively. During the equivalent prior period ended December 31, 2015, we recorded an income tax benefit from continuing operations of $7.2 million and an effective income tax rate of 75.9%.\nOur 41.2% effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 included the impact of various discrete tax items, including the non-cash net charge of $27.5 million recorded as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the acquisition of\nCaisson, inclusive of the $38.1 million non-taxable gain recognized to re-measure our existing equity investments in Caisson at fair value on the acquisition date.\nOur 19.9% effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 included the impact of various discrete tax items, primarily related to a reduction in valuation allowances in the U.S. related to capital loss carryforwards, partially offset by an increase in tax expense related to an unrecognized tax benefit from a tax position taken in prior years.\nOur 75.9% effective income tax rate for the equivalent prior period January 24, 2015 to December 31, 2015, included the impact of various discrete tax items, primarily related to an increase in tax expense resulting from non-deductible transaction costs associated with the merger of Cyberonics and Sorin and an increase in tax expense due to the change in the corporate income tax rate in Italy.\nU.S. Tax Reform\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act\u201d). The Act, which is also commonly referred to as U.S. tax reform\u201d, significantly changes U.S. corporate income tax laws by, among other things, reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21% commencing in 2018. In addition, the Act created a one-time mandatory tax, a toll charge, on previously deferred foreign earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries controlled by a U.S. corporation, or, in our case, a non-U.S. subsidiary controlled by one of our U.S. subsidiaries. We recorded no toll charge for the year ended December 31, 2017 as we had no previously deferred foreign earnings of U.S. controlled foreign subsidiaries as of the measurement dates. As a result of the Act, we recorded a non-cash net charge of $27.5 million during the fourth quarter of 2017, which is included in Income tax expense (benefit) in the consolidated statement of (loss) income. This amount primarily consists of two components: (i) $12.8 million relating to the impairment of foreign tax credits, and (ii) a net $14.7 million charge resulting from the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities in the U.S. based on the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate.\nThe Act also establishes various other new U.S. corporate income tax laws that will affect 2018, including, but not limited to, (1) elimination of the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT); (2) the creation of the base erosion anti-abuse tax (BEAT), a new minimum tax; (3) a new provision designed to tax global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI); (4) a new limitation on deductible interest expense; (5) the repeal of the domestic production activity deduction; (6) limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation; and (7) limitations on net operating losses (NOLs) generated after December 31, 2017, to 80 percent of taxable income. The extent to which these and other provisions of the Act, or future legislation or regulations, could impact our consolidated effective income tax rate in future periods depends on many factors including, but not limited to, the amount of profit generated by our subsidiaries operating in the U.S., the impact of the Company's current or contemplated tax planning strategies, the impact of new or amended tax laws or regulations by countries outside the U.S., and other factors beyond our control.\nFurther regulations and notices and state conformity could be issued as a result of U.S. tax reform covering various issues that may affect our tax position including, but not limited to, an increase in the corporate state tax rate and elimination of the interest deduction. The content of any future legislation, the timing for regulations, notices, and state conformity, and the reporting periods that would be impacted cannot be determined at this time. Although we believe the net charge of $27.5 million is a reasonable estimate of the impact of the income tax effects of the Act on LivaNova as of December 31, 2017, the estimate is provisional. Once we finalize certain tax positions for our 2017 U.S. consolidated tax return, we will be able to conclude whether any further adjustments to our tax positions are required.\nBrexit\nOn June 23, 2016, the UK held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit.\u201d On March 29, 2017, the UK government gave formal notice of its intention to leave the EU, formally commencing the negotiations regarding the terms of withdrawal between the UK and the EU. The withdrawal must occur within two years, unless the deadline is extended. The negotiation process will determine the future terms of the UK's relationship with the EU. The notification does not change the application of existing tax laws, and does not establish a clear framework for what the ultimate outcome of the negotiations and legislative process will be.\nVarious tax reliefs and exemptions that apply to transactions between EU Member States under existing tax laws may cease to apply to transactions between the UK and EU Member States when the UK ultimately withdraws from the EU. It is unclear at this stage if or when any new tax treaties between the UK and the EU or individual EU Member States will replace those reliefs and exemptions. It is also unclear at this stage what financial, trade and legal implications will ensue from Brexit and how Brexit may affect us, our customers, suppliers, vendors, or our industry.\nSeveral of our wholly owned subsidiaries that are domiciled either in the UK, various EU Member States, or in the United States, and our parent company, LivaNova PLC, are party to intercompany transactions and agreements under which we receive\nvarious tax reliefs and exemptions in accordance with applicable international tax laws, treaties and regulations. If certain treaties applicable to our transactions and agreements are not renegotiated or replaced with new treaties containing terms, conditions and attributes similar to those of the existing treaties, Brexit may have a material adverse impact on our future financial results and results of operations. During the two-year negotiation period, we will monitor and assess the potential impact of this event and explore possible tax-planning strategies that may mitigate or eliminate any such potential adverse impact. We will not account for the impact of Brexit in our income tax provisions until changes in tax laws or treaties between the UK and the EU or individual EU Member States with the UK and/or the U.S. are enacted or the withdrawal becomes effective.\nEuropean Union State Aid Challenge\nOn October 26, 2017, the European Commission ( EC\u201d) announced that an investigation will be opened with respect to the UK's controlled foreign company ( CFC\u201d) rules. The CFC rules under investigation provide certain tax exceptions to entities controlled by UK parent companies that are subject to lower tax rates if the activities being undertaken by the CFC relate to financing. The EC is investigating whether the exemption is a breach of EU State Aid rules. The investigation is in its early stages and is unlikely to be completed within the next twelve months with an appeal process likely to follow. It is unclear as to whether the UK will be part of the EU once a decision has been finalized due to Brexit and what impact, if any, Brexit will have on the outcome of the investigation or the enforceability of a decision. Due to the many uncertainties related to this matter, including the preliminary state of the investigation, the pending Brexit negotiations and political environment and the unknown outcome of the investigation and resulting appeals, no uncertain tax position reserve has been recognized related to this matter and we are unable to reasonably estimate the potential liability.\nEquity Method Investments\nLosses from equity method investments were $16.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 were due to investee losses of Highlife, MicroPort and Caisson and the impairment of our investment in, and notes receivable from Highlife of $13.0 million; consisting of investment impairment of $4.7 million and the notes receivable impairment of $8.3 million. In May 2017, we acquired the remaining equity interests in Caisson and we began consolidating the results of Caisson as of the acquisition date.\nWe recognized equity method losses of $18.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 due to investee losses of Caisson, Highlife, Microport and Respicardia and the impairment of our investment in Respicardia of $9.2 million. In November 2016, we terminated our distributor agreement with Respicardia. The distributor agreement had been a key component in the determination of whether our influence over Respicardia was significant, and as a result, we determined that we no longer had significant influence over Respicardia and transferred the investment to our cost method investments.\nWe recognized losses of $2.2 million from our share of investee losses at Highlife, Caisson, Respicardia and MicroPort during the equivalent prior period ended December 31, 2015. All the equity method investments were acquired in the Mergers and therefore investee losses were included in our consolidated statement of (loss) income in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K beginning October 19, 2015.\nResults of Discontinued Operations\nThe table below illustrates the results of discontinued operations (in thousands):\n\nOn November 20, 2017, we entered into a letter of intent ( LOI\u201d) to sell our CRM Business Franchise ( CRM\u201d) to MicroPort Scientific Corporation for $190.0 million in cash. Completion of the transaction is subject to receipt of relevant regulatory approvals, including fulfilling the requirements of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange's Major Transaction requirements, and other customary closing conditions. We expect the transaction to close in the second quarter of 2018.\nCRM develops, manufactures and markets products for the diagnosis, treatment and management of heart rhythm disorders and heart failures. CRM products include high-voltage defibrillators, cardiac resynchronization therapy devices and low-voltage pacemakers. CRM has approximately 900 employees, with operations in Clamart, France; Saluggia, Italy; and Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.\nWe concluded that the sale of CRM represents a strategic shift and therefore qualifies as a discontinued operation under GAAP. As a result, we classified the operating results of CRM as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of (loss) income. Additionally, we tested the long-lived assets of CRM for impairment and recognized an impairment to tangible and intangible assets of $78.3 million, net of a $15.3 million tax benefit. The assets and liabilities of CRM are classified as assets (or liabilities) of discontinued operations on the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSignificant Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates\nWe have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). Our most significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 2. Basis of Presentation, Use of Accounting Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the consolidated financial statements. New accounting pronouncements are disclosed in Note 21. New Accounting Pronouncements\u201d in the consolidated financial statements.\nTo prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of our consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. We consider estimates to be critical if we are required to make assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation, or if materially different estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period. The following are areas requiring management's judgment that we consider critical:\nBusiness Combinations\nWe allocate the amounts we pay for each acquisition to the assets we acquire and liabilities we assume based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition, including identifiable intangible assets and in-process research and development which either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill. We base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination, including in-process research and development, on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management, which consider management's best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use. We allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired to goodwill. Transaction costs associated with these acquisitions are expensed as incurred and are reported as operating expenses.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets shown on the consolidated balance sheet are finite-lived assets. Developed technology rights consist primarily of purchased patents, related know-how and licensed patent rights. Tradenames include the Sorin trade name acquired as part of the Mergers. Customer relationships consist of relationships with hospitals and physicians in the countries where we operate. We amortize our intangible assets over their useful lives using the straight-line method.\nAmortization expense for developed technology is recorded in research and development and cost of goods sold. When the product is marketed, we amortize the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset to cost of goods sold. Amortization expense for trade name and customer relationships is recorded in selling, general and administrative expense. We evaluate our intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances indicate either a different useful life or impairment. If we change our estimate of the useful life of an asset, we amortize the carrying amount over the revised remaining useful life.\nImpairment of Property and Equipment and Intangible Assets\nWe review, when circumstances warrant, the carrying amounts of our property and equipment and our intangible assets to determine whether such carrying amounts continue to be recoverable. Such changes in circumstance may include, among other items, (i) an expectation of a sale or disposal of a long-lived asset or asset group, (ii) adverse changes in market or competitive conditions, (iii) an adverse change in legal factors or business climate in the markets in which we operate and (iv) operating or cash flow losses. For purposes of impairment testing, long-lived assets are grouped at the lowest level for which cash flows are largely independent of other assets and liabilities, generally at or below the reporting unit level. If the carrying amount of the asset or asset group is greater than the expected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by such asset or asset group, an\nimpairment adjustment is recognized. Such adjustment is measured by the amount that the carrying value of such asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. We generally measure fair value by considering (a) sale prices for similar assets, (b) discounted estimated future cash flows using an appropriate discount rate and/or (c) estimated replacement cost. Assets to be disposed of are carried at the lower of their financial statement carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.\nWe evaluate the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually on October 1st and whenever other facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable. For impairment evaluations with respect to both goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles, we first make a qualitative assessment to determine if the goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible may be impaired. In the case of goodwill, if it is more-likely-than-not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value, we then compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its respective carrying amount. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a component\u201d). Our operating segments are deemed to be our reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit were to exceed its fair value, we would then compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill to its carrying amount, and any excess of the carrying amount over the fair value would be charged to operations as an impairment loss. With respect to indefinite-lived intangible assets, if it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, we then estimate its fair value and any excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is also charged to operations as an impairment loss.\nDerivatives\nU.S. GAAP requires companies to recognize all derivatives as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and to measure the instruments at fair value through earnings unless the derivative qualifies for hedge accounting. If the derivative qualifies for hedge accounting, depending on the nature of the hedge and hedge effectiveness, changes in the fair value of the derivative will either be recognized immediately in earnings or recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings upon settlement/termination. The changes in the fair value of the derivative are intended to offset the change in fair value of the hedged asset, liability or probable commitment. We evaluate hedge effectiveness at inception and on an ongoing basis. If a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued. Hedge ineffectiveness, if any, is recorded in earnings. Cash flows from derivative contracts are reported as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nWe use currency exchange rate derivative contracts and interest rate derivative instruments, to manage the impact of currency exchange and interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows. In order to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from currency exchange rate changes, we enter into derivative instruments, principally forward currency exchange rate contracts. These contracts are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions and changes in the value of specific assets and liabilities. At inception of the forward contract, the derivative is designated as either a freestanding derivative or a cash flow hedge. We do not enter into currency exchange rate derivative contracts for speculative purposes. All derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets, as financial asset or liabilities (current or non-current) depending upon the gain or loss position of the contract and contract maturity date.\nForward contracts designated as cash flow hedges are designed to hedge the variability of cash flows associated with forecasted transactions denominated in a foreign currency that will take place in the future. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into earnings to offset exchange differences originated by the hedged item or to adjust the value of operating income (expense).\nWe use freestanding derivative forward contracts to offset exposure to the variability of the value associated with assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency. These derivatives are not designated as hedges, and therefore changes in the value of these forward contracts are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related change in value of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.\nWe use interest rate derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges to manage the exposure to interest rate movements and to reduce the risk of an increase in borrowing costs by converting floating-rate debt into fixed-rate debt. Under these agreements, we agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to agreed-upon notional principal amounts. The interest rate swaps are structured to mirror the payment terms of the underlying loan. The fair value of the interest rate swaps is reported in the consolidated balance sheets financial assets or liabilities (current or non-current) depending upon the gain or loss position of the contract and the maturity of the future cash flows of the fair value of each contract. The effective portion of the gain or loss on these derivatives is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified to interest expense in the consolidated statement of (loss) income when the underlying position is settled. The non-effective portion is reported in interest expense in consolidated statement of (loss) income.\nCost and Equity Method Investments\nCertain of the Company's investments in equity and other securities are strategic investments in companies that are in varied stages of development. These investments are included in Investments on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company accounts for these investments under the cost or the equity method of accounting, as appropriate. The valuation of equity and other securities accounted for under the cost method considers all available financial information related to the investee, including valuations based on recent third-party equity investments in the investee. If an unrealized loss for any investment is considered to be other-than-temporary, the loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of income in the period the determination is made. Equity securities accounted for under the equity method are initially recorded at the amount of the Company's investment and are adjusted each period for the Company's share of the investee's income or loss and dividends paid. Equity securities accounted for under both the cost and equity methods are reviewed quarterly for changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events that suggest the Company's investment may not be recoverable.\nStock-Based Compensation\nOur stock option awards and stock appreciation rights compensation expense is based on the fair market value of our awards and is amortized ratably over the award vesting period. The fair market value is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing methodology at the grant date. This methodology takes into account variables such as the future expected volatility of our stock price, the amount of time expected to elapse between the date of grant and the date of exercise and a risk-free interest rate. Fair values of stock option awards and stock appreciation rights issued in the future may vary significantly from fair values of awards issued in the current period depending on our estimates, and judgments regarding these variables, and therefore expense in future periods, may differ significantly from current-period expense. Refer to Note 2. Basis of Presentation, Use of Accounting Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies\u201d accompanying the consolidated financial statements for further information related to key assumptions.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are a UK corporation, and we operate through our various subsidiaries in a number of countries throughout the world. Our provision for income taxes is based on the tax laws and rates applicable in the jurisdictions in which we operate and earn income. We use significant judgment and estimates in accounting for our income taxes. This involves assessing changes in temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of events for tax and accounting purposes. These assessments result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Actual tax expense may significantly differ from our expectations if, for example, judicial interpretations of tax law, tax regulations or tax rates change.\nWe file federal and local tax returns in many jurisdictions throughout the world and are subject to income tax examinations for our fiscal year 1992 and subsequent years, with certain exceptions. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes and as a result, we may establish reserves for uncertain tax positions, which require a significant degree of management judgment. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of our tax positions in order to determine the appropriateness of our reserves for uncertain tax positions; however, the actual outcome of an audit can be significantly different than our expectations, which could have a material impact on our tax provision. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefit, as of December 31, 2017, if recognized, would reduce our income tax expense by approximately $26.1 million.\nWe are required to periodically assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets by considering whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the actual benefit of those assets will be realized. To the extent that realization does not meet the more-likely-than-not\u201d criterion, we establish a valuation allowance. We periodically review the adequacy and necessity of the valuation allowance by considering significant positive and negative evidence relative to our ability to recover deferred tax assets and to determine the timing and amount of valuation allowance that should be released. Changes in our assessment of the factors related to the recoverability of our deferred tax assets could result in materially different income tax provisions. As of December 31, 2017, we had valuation allowances of $47.4 million that were primarily related to net operating losses in certain jurisdictions and U.S. tax credits. If these valuation allowances were to be released our tax expense would be reduced by $47.4 million.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into U.S. law which provided numerous amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act may impact our U.S. income tax expense (benefit) from continuing operations in future periods.\nForeign Currency\nOur functional currency is the U.S. dollar, however, a portion of the revenues earned and expenses incurred by certain of our subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We determine the functional currency of our subsidiaries\nthat exist and operate in different economic and currency environments based on the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates, that is, the currency of the environment in which an entity primarily generates and expends cash. Our significant foreign subsidiaries are located in Europe and the U.S. The functional currency of our significant European subsidiaries is the Euro and the functional currency of our significant U.S. subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar.\nAssets and liabilities for subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars based on a combination of both current and historical exchange rates, while their revenues earned and expenses incurred are translated into U.S. dollars at average period exchange rates. Translation adjustments are included as \u2018Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)' ( AOCI\u201d) in the consolidated balance sheets. Gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in a currency different from an entity's functional currency are included in Foreign exchange and other gains (losses) in our consolidated statements of income (loss). Taxes are not provided on cumulative translation adjustments, as substantially all translation adjustments are related to earnings which are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the countries where earned.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nBased on our current business plan, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and future cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our expected operating needs, working capital requirements, R&D opportunities, capital expenditures and debt service requirements over the next 12 months. We regularly review our capital needs and consider various investing and financing alternatives to support our requirements. Refer to Note 10. Financing Arrangements\u201d in the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our debt. Our liquidity could be adversely affected by the factors affecting future operating results, including those referred to in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d above.\nCash Flows\nNet cash and cash equivalents provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities and the net increase (decrease) in the balance of cash and cash equivalents were as follows (in thousands):\n\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 $91.3 million, primarily due to adjustments to net income of $220.0 million for non-cash items, which included a non-cash loss of $93.6 million related to the impairment of tangible and intangible assets of our discontinued operations, and depreciation and amortization of $82.9 million, offset by utilization of cash for operating assets and liabilities of $103.6 million.\nCash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $90.2 million, primarily due to a net loss of $62.8 million offset by $161.3 million of non-cash items. Non-cash items were principally composed of $85.4 million in depreciation and amortization and $19.6 million in stock-based compensation.\nDuring the transitional period April 25, 2015 to December 31, 2015, cash utilized in operating activities was $9.3 million, which was net of amortization of $36.3 million related to Sorin's inventory written-up in the Mergers. In connection with the Mergers we acquired $233.8 million of Sorin inventory as of October 19, 2015. In addition, we utilized operating cash for payment of accrued merger costs, which primarily accounted for the decrease in our balance of accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $32.8 million.\nCash provided by operating activities for the historical Cyberonics fiscal year ended April 24, 2015 was $79.7 million, which was primarily attributable to net income of $57.8 million and non-cash operating expense and FX losses of $28.2 million, offset by $6.3 million utilized by operating assets and liabilities, primarily to build inventories.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities was $52.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. We invested $34.1 million in property, plant and equipment. We also utilized cash of $27.9 million related to our investments in privately held medical start-up companies, which included the purchase of the 51% of the remaining interest in Caisson utilizing cash of $14.2 million, and investments in, and loans to, our equity and cost method investees of $13.7 million.\nCash used in investing activities was $44.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to $38.4 million invested in property, plant and equipment and investments in, and loans to, our equity and cost method investees of $14.3 million. These amounts were partially offset by the transfer of $7.0 million to cash and cash equivalents from short-term investments.\nCash provided in investing activities of $16.2 million during the transitional period April 25, 2015 to December 31, 2015 was due to the transfer of $20.0 million to cash and cash equivalents from short-term investments and an increase in cash of $12.5 million obtained in the Mergers, offset by net investment activity of $16.3 million, primarily for property, plant and equipment.\nCash used in investing activities was $9.8 million during the fiscal year ended April 24, 2015. We invested $1.9 million in commercial paper. We also invested $6.7 million in property, plant and equipment primarily due to construction of the Costa Rica manufacturing facility. We also invested $1.2 million in Cerbomed, which was fully impaired during the transitional period April 25, 2015 to December 31, 2015.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 was $11.3 million, which includes $32.4 million in borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and repayment of long-term debt of $22.8 million. We also borrowed $2.0 million in additional long-term debt.\nCash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 was $118.0 million, which includes $54.5 million to repurchase shares, a $33.7 million reduction in revolving credit facilities, repayment of advances on customer receivables of $23.8 million and repayment of long-term debt of $21.1 million. We also borrowed $7.2 million in additional long-term debt.\nCash used in financing activities during the transitional period April 25, 2015 to December 31, 2015 was $18.1 million, which included the repayment of long-term debt of $32.0 million, and the purchase of treasury shares for $7.3 million, partially offset by cash proceeds from net short-term debt borrowing of $11.1 million and stock based compensation activities of $8.8 million.\nCash used in financing activities during the year ended April 24, 2015 was $48.3 million, which was primarily due to stock repurchases of $55.0 million.\nDebt and Capital\nOur capital structure consists of debt and equity. As of December 31, 2017, our total debt of $146 million was 8.0% of total equity of $1.8 billion. As of December 31, 2016, our total debt of $123 million was 7.2% of total equity of $1.7 billion.\nDebt Acquired in the Mergers\nAt the consummation of the Mergers on October 19, 2015, LivaNova acquired all of the outstanding debt of Sorin in the aggregate principal amount of $203.0 million payable to various financial and non-financial institutions. Prior to the Mergers Cyberonics had no debt.\nDebt - Post Mergers\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we increased our outstanding revolving credit facilities by $32.4 million, repaid $22.8 million of long-term debt obligations and borrowed $2.0 million in additional long-term debt.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we reduced our outstanding revolving credit facilities by $33.7 million, repaid $21.1 million of long-term debt obligations and borrowed $7.2 million in additional long-term debt.\nFactoring\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we reduced our obligation for advances on customer receivables by $23.8 million, thereby eliminating this form of financing.\nContractual Obligations\nWe have various contractual commitments that we expect to fund from existing cash, future operating cash flows and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. The actual timing of the clinical commitment payments may vary based on the completion of milestones which are beyond our control. The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 and the periods in which such obligations are due (in thousands):\n\n (1) Contractual obligations do not include $26.1 million of unrecognized tax benefits, inclusive of interest and penalties, included on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017. We are unable to specify with certainty the future periods in which we may be obligated to settle such amounts.  We have other commitments that we are contractually obligated to fulfill with cash under certain circumstances. These commitments include letters of credit to guarantee our performance as it relates to our contract bidding, VAT tax, tax appeals, and other obligations in various jurisdictions. Obligations under these guarantees are not normally called, as we typically comply with underlying performance requirements. As of December 31, 2017, no liability has been recorded in the financial statements associated with these obligations.\nThe following table summarizes our guarantees as of December 31, 2017 (in thousands):\n\n (1) Government bid guarantees include such items as unconditional bank guarantees, irrevocable letters of credit and bid bonds. \n (2) Commercial guarantees include our lease and tenancy guarantees. \n (3) The guarantees to the governmental tax authorities consist primarily of the guarantee issued to the Italian VAT Authority. \n (4) Guarantees to third-parties consist primarily of irrevocable letters of credit and tenancy guarantees. \nMarket Risk\nWe are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations, including risks from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rate risks and concentration of procurement suppliers that could adversely affect our consolidated balance sheets, net (loss) income and cash flow.\nWe manage these risks through regular operating and financing activities and, at certain times, derivative financial instruments.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nDue to the global nature of our operations, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We maintain a foreign currency exchange rate risk management strategy that utilizes derivatives to reduce our exposure to unanticipated fluctuations in forecast revenue and costs and fair values of debt, inter-company debt and accounts receivables caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nWe mitigate our credit risk relating to counter-parties of our derivatives through a variety of techniques, including transacting with multiple, high-quality financial institutions, thereby limiting our exposure to individual counter-parties and by entering into International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. ( ISDA\u201d) Master Agreements, which include provisions for a legally enforceable master netting agreement, with almost all of our derivative counter-parties. The terms of the ISDA agreements may also include credit support requirements, cross default provisions, termination events, or set-off provisions. Legally enforceable master netting agreements reduce credit risk by providing protection in bankruptcy in certain circumstances and generally permitting the closeout and netting of transactions with the same counter-party upon the occurrence of certain events.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are subject to interest rate risk on our investments and debt. We manage a portion of our interest rate risk with contracts that swap floating-rate interest payments for fixed rate interest payments. If interest rates were to increase or decrease by 0.5%, the effects on our consolidated statement of (loss) income would not be material.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nOur trade accounts receivable represent potential concentrations of credit risk. This risk is limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across a number of geographic areas, as well as our efforts to control our exposure to credit risk by monitoring our receivables and the use of credit approvals and credit limits. In addition, we have historically had strong collections and minimal write-offs. While we believe that our reserves for credit losses are adequate, essentially all of our trade receivables are concentrated in the hospital and healthcare sectors worldwide, and accordingly, we are exposed to their respective business, economic and country-specific variables. Although we do not currently foresee a concentrated credit risk associated with these receivables, repayment is dependent on the financial stability of these industry sectors and the respective countries' national economies and healthcare systems.\nFactors Affecting Future Operating Results and Share Price\nThe factors affecting our future operating results and share prices are disclosed in Item 1A.
